Articles with good mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and/or tensile elongation, can be made with these synthetic hydroxy-functional polymers in combination with natural polymers. Such articles are biodegradable and have a reduced cost of manufacture due to the inclusion of a low cost natural polymer, such as starch.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Starches and modified starches have been the focus of considerable research interest in attempts to use these as fillers in order to decrease polymer costs and to use polymers that are biodegradable. As several recent examples, U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,187, issued Jan. 24, 1995, inventors Uemura et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,423, issued Feb. 21, 1995, inventors Wnuk et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,005, issued May 2, 1995, inventors Bastioli et al., all represent domestic and foreign based attempts to achieve biodegradable polymer compositions in which natural polymers such as starches have been added to synthetic polymers. Unfortunately, while the inclusion of starches can reduce costs, the mechanical properties of the synthetic polymer can be so adversely affected by inclusion of starch as to vitiate the cost advantages.</p><p>Among examples of physical strength loss when starch is blended with various synthetic polymers are those described in several recent articles. Thus, for example, Koenig and Huang, PMSE, 67, pp. 290-291 (1992) used three different types of synthetic polymers in combination with starch and starch derivatives and reported their properties. When polycaprolactone ("PCL") was filled with 25 wt. % starch or a starch derivative the yield strength and the tensile strength were reduced by half.</p><p>Ramsay et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 59, pp. 1242-1246 (1993) studied poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates with starch. The biodegradable polymer [P(HB-co-HV)] was said to hold biodegradable promise, but the polymer is significantly higher in price than a commodity plastic such as polyethylene or polystyrene. The inclusion of 25 wt. % granular starch was reported to result in a composition with a tensile strength of about 60% the original (16 MPa by contrast to 27 MPa). The authors acknowledged that the use of unmodified granular starch as a particulate filler in the [P(HB-co-HV)] polymer reduced the tensile strength and did not offer any appreciable reinforcement in the mechanical rigidity, presumably due to poor adhesion of the polymer granule interface. The authors concluded it would be necessary to develop formulations with improved adhesion.</p><p>Accordingly, attempts continue to find synthetic polymer based compositions that can be formed into articles, such as for example disposable plastic utensils or stretchable thin films for food packaging purposes, that are reasonably competitive in price with commodity plastics such as polyethylene or polystyrene, but which are more environmentally friendly.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In one aspect of the present invention, compositions are provided that comprise a synthetic, hydroxy-functional polymer and a natural polymer. The synthetic polymer is a hydroxy-functional polyester that is surprisingly compatible with the natural polymer. The inventive compositions are useful for forming articles, particularly by thermoplastic processing such as molding, extrusion, and casting. Particularly preferred aspects of the invention are where the natural polymer is in the form of granules and where the natural polymer is gelatinized.</p><p>The synthetic, hydroxy-functional polymer may be as described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,820, inventors Mang and White, issued Dec. 15, 1992 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,910, inventors Mang, White and Swanson, issued Mar. 5, 1996.</p><p>Natural polymers for mixture with the synthetic, hydroxy-functional polymer include polysaccharides, modified polysaccharides, naturally-occurring fibers, and particulate fillers. Particularly preferred as the natural polymer are starches.</p><p>While the amount of hydroxy-functional polymers used depends on a variety of factors, including the specific polymer employed and the desired end uses of the composition, hydroxy-functional polymers generally can be present in an amount from about 1 to about 99 wt. % based on the total weight of the hydroxy-functional polymer and the natural polymer.</p><heading>GRANULE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>Articles where the natural polymer is in granular or fiber form (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "granule embodiment") can be formulated so as to have a tensile strength above about 20 MPa (sufficiently strong for example, so as to form disposable utensils) or to have a tensile elongation above about 200% (sufficient stretchability, for example, so as to form thin wrapping films). With one particularly preferred granule embodiment, a composition is provided with 45 wt. % starch granules (derived from corn) having an elongation of about 500%. In another particularly preferred granule embodiment, a composition is provided with 60 wt. % starch granules (derived from corn) having a tensile strength of about 22 MPa.</p><p>The remarkable compatibility of the hydroxy-functional polymers with natural polymers is illustrated by tests showing that inclusion of small amounts of granular starch into several hydroxy-functional polyesters actually increases the tensile strength of hydroxy-functional polyester. Another example of the remarkable compatibility of the particular hydroxy-functional polyesters described with granular starch is shown in instances where inclusion of plasticizer actually leads to moderately improved tensile strength, although presence of plasticizer in other polymer compositions typically softens such compositions.</p><p>In the granule embodiment, the two essential components may be admixed in varying amounts. The natural polymer may be present in a trace amount or in greater amounts up to a weight ratio with respect to the hydroxy-functional polyester of about 8:1, more preferably up to about 6:1.</p><heading>GELATINIZED STARCH EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>When the natural polymer is in gelatinized or thermoplastic form, inventive compositions can be used to form a variety of articles, such as foams, films and laminates. Expanded, or foam articles are subjected to an expansion process whereby an expansion agent (e.g. water) and a nucleating agent cause bubbles, or cells, to form. The expanded articles are typically water resistant. For example, some inventive expanded articles have shown no substantial disintegration when immersed in water at ambient conditions for at least about 30 minutes. Particularly preferred expanded embodiments have been extruded as a resilient, compressible, low density, substantially closed cell matrix. This compressible and resilient matrix may be the desired end result article (e.g. packaging "peanuts") or may be further processed to form desired articles, particularly by a molding thermoforming technique. These molded articles can have exterior surfaces with sufficient resistance to moisture as to be suitable for packaging materials when a liquid component is present, such as with hot, moisture emitting take-out foods.</p><p>An expanded article in accordance with the invention, was for example, formed from a composition having 10 wt % of a hydroxy-containing polyester, 89 wt % gelatinized starch and water (where about 17 wt. % of the total composition was water), and 1 wt. % nucleating agent, which was expanded in a pilot scale twin screw extruder. This resulted in expanded articles with a bulk density of about 0.64 lb/ft.sup.3 (2.5.times.10.sup.-2 g/cm.sup.3), a resilience of about 64% and a compressibility of about 0.10 MPa. These expanded articles were tested for moisture resistance. Even after being immersed in water at room temperature and stirred with a magnetic stirring bar at 200 rpm for 30 minutes, the water remained clear, which indicated that no substantial disintegration of the articles had occurred.</p><p>Compositions of the invention are also useful in forming articles such as films with selective water resistance, good elongation, and good structural integrity properties.</p><p>The compositions of the invention can also be used for making laminates comprising at least two layers. One layer is a self-supporting structure comprising a natural polymer and another layer is self-adhered to the structure. The self-adhering layer is a hydroxy-functional polyester as described herein. Inventive laminates typically do not delaminate even when soaked in water and stretched.</p><p>Other advantages and aspects of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the specification and the appended claims.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 is a scanning electron micrograph of one granule inventive embodiment at a magnification of 1000;</p><p>FIG. 2 is a scanning electron microgram of another inventive granule embodiment, again at a magnification of 1000, which was made following an elongation test;</p><p>FIGS. 3A and 3B are electron micrographs of a composition at two different stages of mixing: FIG. 3A is a micrograph of an inventive composition (designated 12H) after it has been compounded once and thus only partially mixed; and FIG. 3B is a micrograph of this inventive composition (now designated 12H') after it has been compounded twice and is an example of a thoroughly mixed composition;</p><p>FIG. 4 is an electron micrograph of an inventive composition designated 77"; and</p><p>FIG. 5 is an electron micrograph of an inventive composition designated 78".</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>Broadly, the present invention comprises a composition consisting essentially of two essential components: the first component is a synthetic hydroxy-functional polymer, more particularly is an hydroxy-functional polyester having a repeating structure as will hereinafter be described, and the second component is a natural polymer.</p><p>The natural polymer may be, for example, a polysaccharide, a modified polysaccharide, or a naturally occurring fiber or particulate filler, but preferably is starch or a modified starch.</p><p>While the amount of hydroxy-functional polymer selected for use depends on a variety of factors, including the specific polymer employed and the desired end uses of the composition, in general hydroxy-functional, synthetic polymers can be present in an amount of from 1 to 99 wt. %, preferably from 1 to 95 wt. %, and most preferably from 10 to 90 wt. %, based on the total weight of the hydroxy-functional polyester and the natural polymer. Particularly preferred compositions for forming films have natural polymer present as less than about 50 wt. % of the total composition; and hydroxy-functional, synthetic polymer present in amounts from at least about 10 wt. % to about 70 wt. %.</p><p>Natural polymers contemplated for use include biodegradable organic fillers, such as cellulose and other fibers and the like, which are well known. Naturally occurring fibers or particulate fillers which can be employed in the practice of the present invention for preparing the composition are, for example, wood flour, wood pulp, wood fibers, cotton, flax, hemp, or ramie fibers, rice or wheat straw, chitin, chitosan, cellulose materials derived from agricultural products, nut shell flour, corn cob flour, and mixtures thereof. Polysaccharides which can be employed in the practice of the present invention for preparing the composition are the different starches, celluloses, hemicelluloses, gums, pectins, and pullulans. Polysaccharides are known and are described, for example, in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, 2nd edition, 1987.</p><p>Modified polysaccharides which can be employed in the practice of the present invention for preparing the composition are the esters and ethers of polysaccharides, such as, for example, cellulose ethers and cellulose esters, or starch esters and starch ethers. Modified polysaccharides are known and are described, for example, in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, 2nd edition, 1987.</p><p>When practicing the granule embodiment of the invention, the granules of natural polymer preferably will have a particle size of less than about 100 μm, and more preferably have a particle size of up to about 50 μm and a water content of less than about 15 wt. %, more preferably less than about 10 or 11 wt. %. In the granule embodiment, the two essential components may be admixed in varying amounts. The natural polymer may be present in a trace amount or in greater amounts up to a weight ratio with respect to the hydroxy-functional polyester of about 8:1, more preferably up to about 6:1.</p><p>When practicing the invention so as to obtain expanded or some film articles, the preferred starch component is derived from a gelatinized starch or a gelatinized modified starch. By "modified" is meant that the starch can be derivatized or modified by typical processes known in the art (e.g. esterification, etherification, oxidation, acid hydrolysis, cross-linking and enzyme conversion). Thus, for example, a modified starch may be a starch ester, a starch ether, or a crosslinked starch. Conventional modifications of starch are described in publications such as Starch: Chemistry and Technology, 2d edition, editor Whistler et al., and Starch Derivatives: Production and Uses, Rutenberg et al., Academic Press, Inc., 1984.</p><p>When starch is said to be "gelatinized" it has melted and lost its crystalline state. The starch molecules have taken on a random, disordered configuration and the starch chains have become entangled. Thus, the starch is thermoplastic and is sometimes referred to as "destructured." When the gelatinized starch is admixed with the synthetic polymer under extrusion conditions so that the entire admixture is molten, the two molten polymers (natural polymer and synthetic polymer) would be expected to be homogeneously dispersed throughout the body of the extrudate in the respective proportions of each component; however, this normally does not seem to occur. Instead, the synthetic polymer has been found typically to partition so as to predominate along exterior surfaces and to remain as the predominate component along such exterior surfaces.</p><p>Suitable Hydroxy-Functional Polyesters</p><p>The preparation and structures for hydroxy-functional polyesters suitable in practicing this invention may be as described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,820, inventors Mang and White, issued Dec. 15, 1992, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,910, inventors Mang, White and Swanson, issued Mar. 5, 1996, which are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference. Such useful hydroxy-functional polyesters for this invention may be prepared from base-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of suitable acids to epoxies, which reaction generates both an ester linkage and a pendent hydroxyl group. Transesterification and cross linking reactions are eliminated through use of quaternary ammonium halide salts as initiators for the reaction of diacids with diglycidyl ethers, providing convenient preparation of high molecular weight, thermoplastic, hydroxy-functional polyesters in ether solvents at temperatures from 80 C.-160 of hydroxy-functional polyesters such as described by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,171,820 and 5,496,910) indicates the biodegradable nature of these polymers through the ability of various soil bacteria (such as Pseudomonas putida) to use the synthetic polymers as a substrate for cell culture growth.</p><p>Representative structures for suitable hydroxy-functional polyesters in practicing this invention are represented by Formula A (where n provides a sufficient molecular weight, such as for example a m.w. of about 50,000-100,000. Higher molecular weights are preferred due to higher strength. ##STR1## In Formula A each of R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 is individually a divalent organic moiety which is predominately hydrocarbon, each R.sup.3 is individually hydrogen or lower alkyl, y is a fraction from 0 to 0.5 and x is a fraction from about 0.05 to about 0.4. Typically Y is hydrogen or glycidyl and Y' is glycidyl arylene ether, glycidyl alkyene ester, glycidyl alkylene ether or glycidyl arylene ester.</p><p>Thus, suitable polyesters have repeating units represented by Formula B (where each of R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3, x, and y are as defined above). ##STR2##</p><p>Such polyesters may be prepared from diglycidyl esters of an aliphatic diacid such as adipic due to the ready availability and reasonable price for adipic acid as a source of reactant. Other particularly preferred polyesters may be prepared from dihydric phenols, such as hydroquinone.</p><p>Four particularly preferred hydroxy-functional polyesters, used extensively to illustrate (but not to limit) the present invention, are sometimes hereinafter designated "BIS CHD," "BIS adipic," "HQ DDCA" and "BIS DDCA." These polymers will include some repeating unit structures, where the repeating units are illustrated respectively by Formulas C-F. Several of their properties of interest for the invention are summarized in Table A. ##STR3##</p><p>In Formulas C-F, "n" preferably is as earlier described.</p><p>With reference to the data of Table A, one sees that two of the hydroxy-functional polyesters used to illustrate the granule embodiment of the invention have a quite high percentage elongation property (HQ DDCA and BIS DDCA). Thus, one would tend to choose one of these (or another with a relatively high percentage elongation property) when one wished to formulate an embodiment of the invention that had high percent elongation.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE A______________________________________Hydroxy-Functional    TensilePolyester Components       Tg (                 Strength (MPa)                             % Elongation______________________________________BIS CHD     66        60-61       172BIS adipic  45        12          157HQ DDCA     10        14          612BIS DDCA    20        1.2         487______________________________________</pre></p><p>Similarly, if one wished to formulate an inventive embodiment with outstanding tensile strength, a hydroxy-functional polyester such as BIS CHD could be chosen; however, due to the remarkable compatibility of natural polymers with the hydroxy-functional polyesters, even a polyester with a relatively modest tensile strength, such as BIS adipic, can be formulated to have substantially improved tensile strength. This will be demonstrated hereinafter by Table 3 of Example 4.</p><p>Another means of describing suitable synthetic hydroxy-functional polymers for practicing the invention is as described by Formula I in PCT application published as International Publication No. WO 97/23564, on Jul. 3, 1997, inventors Mang and White. The below illustrated repeating structure described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,910, inventors Mang, White and Swanson, issued Mar. 5, 1996, incorporated herein by reference and designated here as Formula I is believed to encompass Formula B.</p><p>Thus, the Formula I polymers have repeating units represented by the formula: ##STR4## wherein R.sup.a individually represents a divalent organic moiety which is predominantly hydrocarbylene (where the term "hydrocarbylene" means a divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety, such as alkylene, alkenylene or cycloalkylene having from 2 to 20 carbons and optionally containing a heteroatomic group, such as oxygen, sulfur, imino, sulfonyl, carboxyl, carbonyl or sulfoxyl, in the chain or pendant thereto) or a combination of different organic moieties which are predominantly hydrocarbylene;</p><p>R.sup.c is ##STR5## R.sup.d is ##STR6## wherein R.sup.b is a divalent organic moiety which is predominantly hydrocarbylene or ##STR7## R.sup.e is hydrogen or lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, butyl and propyl, more preferably hydrogen, R.sup.f is independently an organic moiety which is predominantly hydrocarbylene, R.sup.g is independently hydrogen or methyl, n' is an integer from about 0 to about 100, and x' and y' are independently integers from 0 to 100.</p><p>Representative divalent organic moieties useful as R.sup.a, R.sup.b, and R.sup.f include alkylene, cycloalkylene, alkylenearylene, poly(alkyleneoxyalkylene), alkylenethioalkylene, alkylenesulfonylalkylene, alkylene substituted with at least one hydroxyl group, cycloalkylene substituted with at least one hydroxyl group, alkylenearylene substituted with at least one hydroxyl group, poly(alkyleneoxyalkylene) substituted with at least one hydroxyl group, alkylenethioalkylene substituted with at least one hydroxyl group, alkylenesulfonylalkylene substituted with at least one hydroxyl group; arylene, dialkylenearylene, diaryleneketone, diarylenesulfone, diarylene oxide, and diarylene sulfide.</p><p>In the more preferred hydroxy-functional polyethers, R.sup.a, R.sup.b, and R.sup.f are independently methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene, heptamethylene, octamethylene, nonamethylene, decamethylene, dodecamethylene, 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,3-cyclohexylene, or 1,2-cyclohexylene optionally substituted with at least one hydroxyl group, p-phenylene, m-phenylene, or 2,6-naphthalene, diphenyleneisopropylidene, sulfonyldiphenylene, carbonyldiphenylene, oxydiphenylene, or 9,9-fluorenediphenylene and n' is from 0 to 10.</p><p>The polymers represented by Formula I may be prepared by reacting diglycidyl esters or aliphatic or aromatic diacids such as diglycidyl terephthalate, or diglycidyl ethers of dihydric phenols or alcohols with aliphatic or aromatic diacids such as adipic or terephthalic acid. Thus, suitable polymers for the present invention can be prepared by reacting a hydroxy-functional aliphatic diacid, optionally in the presence of another diacid, with a diglycidyl ether or diglycidyl ester or a mixture of diglycidyl ethers or diglycidyl esters at conditions sufficient to cause the acid moieties to react with the epoxy moieties to form a polymer backbone having ester linkages, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,820.</p><p>Preferred Starches</p><p>Among the natural polymers suitable for practicing this invention are the particularly preferred starches. Starch is a low-cost and abundant natural polymer composed of amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is essentially a linear polymer having a number average molecular weight in the range of 100,000-500,000, whereas amylopectin is a highly branched polymer having a number average molecular weight of up to several million. Unmodified, natural starches are obtained in granular form and may be derived from cereals or grains (such as corn, wheat, rice and sorghum), roots (such as cassava), legumes (such as peas), and tubers such as potato and canna. Such starch granules typically have a particle size less than about 50 μm, which is the preferred particle size when practicing the granule embodiment. While less preferred, flours whose contents are predominately starch, and which may also contain protein, oil and fiber, are operative in the invention. Where such other natural polymers are used for granular embodiment formulations, they will be processed so as to be in granular form and preferably will have a relatively uniform particle size of about 50 μm or less. Starches derived from potato and canna are less preferred for use due to their relatively large particle size of about 40 μm to about 100 μm.</p><p>Starch granules for use in the granule embodiment will normally have a water content of less than about 15 wt. %, more preferably less than about 10-11 wt. %. As will be exemplified, granules may be pre-dried to less than about 1% moisture before compounding. Although preferred, pre-drying is not believed necessary.</p><p>Derivatized (modified) starches are also suitable for use in this invention. By "derivatized starches" is meant to include starches which have been chemically treated so as to form starch esters, starch ethers, and crosslinked starches. By "modified" is meant that the starch can be derivatized or modified by typical processes known in the art (e.g. esterification, etherification, oxidation, acid hydrolysis, cross-linking and enzyme conversion). Typically, modified starches include esters, such as the acetate ester of dicarboxylic acids/anhydrides. Particularly useful are the alkenyl-succinic acids, and hydrides, ethers (such as the hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl starches), starches oxidized with hypochlorite, starches reacted with cross-linking agents such as phosphorus oxychloride, epichlorhydrin, hydrophobic cationic epoxides, and phosphate derivatives prepared by reaction with sodium or potassium orthophosphate or tripoly-phosphate and combinations thereof. These and other conventional modifications of starch are described in publications such as Starch: Chemistry and Technology, 2d edition, editor Whistler et al., and Starch Derivatives: Production and Uses, Rutenberg et al., Academic Press, Inc. 1984.</p><p>For example, starch esters may be prepared using a wide variety of anhydrides, organic acids, acid chlorides, or other esterification reagents. Examples of anhydrides are acetic, propionic, butyric, and so forth. Further, the degree of esterification can vary as desired, such as from one to three per glucosidic unit of the starch, or as appropriate given the number of hydroxyl groups in the monomeric unit of the natural polymer, if selected to be other than starch. Similar or different esterified natural polymers, with varying degrees of esterification, can be blended together for practicing the invention. Although esterified starches are stable to attack by amylases, in the environment the esterified starches are attached by microorganisms secreting esterases which hydrolyze the ester linkage.</p><p>Starch esters tend to be hydrophobic in contrast to starch raw materials (that is, derived by usual techniques from natural sources such as corn). Thus, depending upon the particular application, one may prefer to choose an hydrophobic starch ester rather than a hydrophilic starch in formulating compositions of the invention.</p><p>Although starches are preferred for use as the natural polymers, particularly due to ready availability and low cost, but as earlier noted other suitable natural polymers (in or prepared to be in granular form of a suitable particle size) are hydroxyl containing polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, chitin, guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, xanthan, algin, agar, and dextran. Some of these can play the role of filler, also. Excellent results have been obtained with both granulated guar gum and cellulose powder, as will be exemplified hereinafter.</p><p>Optional Components</p><p>A plasticizer can be added to the inventive compositions to achieve greater material processability and product flexibility, although plasticizers typically soften the compositions in which they are included. This is not always true, however, of compositions of the invention, as will be discussed hereinafter. Molded articles and films prepared from blends including plasticizers preferably use plasticizers that are biodegradable. Examples of biodegradable plasticizers include various esters, such as phthalate esters, and various other biodegradable esters known in the chemical arts.</p><p>Inorganic fillers can be added, such as talc, calcium carbonate, diatomaceous earth, and so forth.</p><p>Precursor film-forming compositions of the invention can have part of the hydroxy-functional polymer replaced by a synthetic vinyl polymer such as poly(vinyl alcohol) or "PVA." Thus, amounts of PVA may range from 0-40 wt. % in the total inventive compositions and resulting films which, when combined with the hydroxy-functional polyester, will constitute the major component of the compositions. Inclusion of PVA will enhance film softness and film elongation, but does reduce water resistance. Therefore, the choice of whether to add PVA and the selection of the amount to be added will depend upon the balance of properties desired for the resulting films.</p><p>In addition, a suitable optional material for film-forming is a plasticizer (in addition to the gelatinizing agent, such as water). A plasticizer can be added to the compositions to achieve greater material processability and product flexibility, although plasticizers typically soften the compositions in which they are included. This is not always true, however, of compositions of the invention. When incorporated into compositions of the invention, the plasticizers preferably are biodegradable. Examples of biodegradable plasticizers include various esters, such as phthalate esters, and various other biodegradable esters known in the chemical arts. Plasticizers (other than water) are particularly preferred for inclusion into blown films, but more typically are not needed for cast films.</p><p>Other optional components known in the art, including, but not limited to, antiblocking agents, antistatic agents, slip agents, pro-heat stabilizers, antioxidants, pro-oxidant, additives may be incorporated, depending upon the application.</p><p>Antiblocking agents act to prevent film layers from sticking to one another when wound into a roll or when packaged in contact with one another. Typical antiblocking substances include concentrates of silica or talc blended with a polymeric materials such as polyethylene or polycaprolactone.</p><p>Reduction of blocking can also be obtained by loading the film surface with small particles or powders such as chalk, clay, silica, starch, and similar materials. Powdered polymeric materials (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene) can also be used to reduce blocking when applied to the surface of films of the present invention. Such film surface treatments can be used to reduce blocking alone or in combination with other antiblock methods. The quantity of powder antiblock substance commonly added to the surface of a film, when used, is from about 0.5 g/m.sup.2 to about 5 g/m.sup.2.</p><p>Antistatic agents may be incorporated in films of the present invention; examples of such agents include ethoxylated amines and quaternary amine salts having organic constituents of about 12-18 carbon atoms in length. Agents of this type slowly defuse to the surface of the film and, because of their ionic character, form an electrically conductive layer on the surface of the film. Antistatic agents commonly constitute from about 1% to about 5% of the weight of the films, when used.</p><p>Slip agents may be incorporated into the films of the present invention to reduce drag over rollers and other forming equipment. Examples of such agents are those commonly derived from amides of fatty acids having about 12-22 carbon atoms. Such agents may augment the antiblocking properties of the films of the present invention. Such slip agents are commonly incorporated in films from about 0.05% to about 3% of the weight of the films when used.</p><heading>EXPERIMENTAL</heading><p>Aspects of the invention will now be illustrated, without intending any limitation, by the following examples. Examples 1-17 illustrate aspects of granule embodiments of the invention. Examples 18-19 illustrate aspects of expanded embodiments, while Examples 20-22 illustrate films (where Example 8 also shows that granule embodiments can be used to prepare films). Examples 23 and 24 illustrate laminate embodiments. The Examples 20-22 are taken from examples described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/653,634, filed May 24, 1996, inventors Xu, Doane and Lawton, Jr. and the Examples 23 and 24 are taken from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/673,273, filed Jun. 28, 1996, inventors Doane, Lawton, Jr. and Shogren.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading><p>Inventive granule embodiments were prepared from premixed batches of starch or derivatized starch and polyester and optionally containing plasticizer or other additives. The starches were pre-dried to less than 1% moisture before compounding. Compounding was then accomplished on a Brabender PL2000 torque rheometer using a mixing screw with a fluted dispersive mixing section and a notched distributive section. Strands from the die were air cooled and pelletized.</p><p>The compounded pellets were then injection molded into tensile bars (ASTM D638 Type V) either with a Cincinnati Millicron Model ACT-75B or a Rabit Hy-4 ram-type machine with a single cavity mold. For some compositions tensile bars were stamped from compression molded blanks formed in a Carver Press. Tensile bars were conditioned at 50% RH and 23 for one day before testing in order to provide equivalent conditions in comparing one run to another. Selected compositions were also tested after immersion in water for one day.</p><p>Tensile tests were performed on an Instron Model 4201 testing system.</p><p>As illustrated by the data in Tables 1-6, inventive granule embodiment compositions may be made as formed articles. Compositions of the invention are suitable for thermoplastic processing, such as molding, extrusion and casting, in applications where solid articles are desired as well as where thin, stretchable films are desired. In preparing the various articles from inventive compositions, the relative amounts of components will vary as one balances the properties desired with processability. For example, compositions including above about 80 wt. % starch tend to be more difficult to process.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading><p>Embodiments of the invention were prepared as described by Example 1. Four were selected for having a tensile strength above about 20 MPa, as is set out by the data of Table 1. The natural polymer used for all four compositions was corn-derived starch granules.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 1______________________________________Inventive   Wt. %      Wt. %            TensileComposition   Starch     Polymer.sup.a                       Other   Strength (MPa)______________________________________1       15         85       --      66.32       30         70       --      39.03       45         55       --      22.04       60         40       --      23.3______________________________________ .sup.a The hydroxyfunctional polyester was BIS CHD.</pre></p><p>The inventive composition 1 is remarkable in its tensile strength property when one considers that the tensile strength of 100% BIS CHD polymer is 60-61 MPa. This means the inventive composition with 15 wt. % starch has a tensile strength that is increased with respect to the polyester itself. This is another illustration of the remarkable compatibility between natural polymers, such as the granular starch component, and the hydroxy-functional polyester for compositions of the invention.</p><p>Returning to the data of Table 1, although inventive compositions 3 and 4 had only about 1/3 the tensile strength in comparison to a composition with all polyester, nevertheless even the highly starch filled composition had a tensile strength adequate for forming a number of useful articles, such as for example disposable utensils.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading><p>Further embodiments of the invention were prepared as described by Example 1.

A comparison of inventive composition 3 from Table 1 with inventive composition 15 of Table 2 illustrates that the use of particular plasticizers can moderately improve tensile strengths. This is another example of the remarkable compatibility of the two essential components of the invention because plasticizer is normally used to improve processing, but normally softens the composition.</p><p>Inventive compositions 16 and 7-9 of Table 2 and inventive compositions 3 and 4 of Table 1 have tensile strength values in the range of about 18-23 MPa. That is, these inventive compositions have better tensile strength than the biodegradable compositions reported by Ramsey, supra, but by contrast to the Ramsey compositions the inventive compositions included between about 45-60 wt. % starch granules (whereas the Ramsey compositions included only about 25 wt. % granular starch).</p><heading>EXAMPLE 4</heading><p>Yet more embodiments of the invention were prepared as described by Example 1, and four were selected for having a tensile strength above about 20 MPa, the data for which are set out by Table 3.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 3______________________________________Inventive   Wt. %      Wt. %            TensileComposition   Starch     Polymer.sup.a                       Other   Strength (MPa)______________________________________28      15         85       --      33.029      30         70       --      46.730      45         55       --      41.831      60         40       --      25.6______________________________________ .sup.a The hydroxyfunctional polyester was BIS adipic.</pre></p><p>The data of Table 3 illustrates inventive compositions with yet another hydroxy-functional polyester.

A second comparative product was "Clean-Green" from Clean Green (comparative peanut 2). A third comparative product was "Enpak" from DuPont (comparative peanut 3).

In such instances, this outside layer is observable even on a macroscopic level as conveying a rather smooth surface to the exterior.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 20</heading><p>Films of the invention were prepared from a composition with BIS adipic polyester (70%) and starch (30%, containing 25% moisture based on starch), which was processed on a Brabender PL 2000 torque rheometer using a mixing screw (3/4 inch, L/D=30). Extruded strands were pelletized and the moisture adjusted to a total of 6.5% for the pellets. The pellets were re-fed to the same torque rheometer that was now fitted with a 1 inch blown film die. The composition was processed into a blown film with a lay flat width of about 3 inches. The film was somewhat transparent and highly water resistant.</p><p>Scanning electron microscopy of an edge of the film revealed a center portion containing starch and outer surface consisting of BIS adipic polyester. Confirmation of this film structure was confirmed by Attenuated Total Reflectance Infra Red Spectroscopy. Absorbance spectra of the film surface revealed absorbance only for the BIS adipic polyester.</p><p>The percent elongation of the film averaged 105.50% and the tensile strength averaged 16.03 MPa. The films tested had an average thickness of 0.1126 mm. Water resistance was measured by water uptake by placing film specimens in water for a short time, removing the specimens, removing excess surface water by blotting, and weighing the resulting specimen. The increase in weight of the soaked films was expressed in percent of the initial weight. Since the film specimens had edges that would allow the internal portion of the film to be exposed to water, it would be expected that some water pickup would occur at the edges. As the original films were produced as bubbles, cutting films into strips does expose the center of the film at the cut edges. The water uptake as a percent for the films was, however, only 1.6%.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 21</heading><p>A number of film-forming compositions were prepared as outlined in Table 15. Except for composition 50, which was high amylose starch, the starch component used was normal cornstarch. The compositions also could include PVA (Airvol 325, intermediate molecular weight, fully hydrolyzed), EAA-poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid), glycerol, and BIS adipic polyester. The compositions were prepared with enough water to equal about 30% of the total weight of the ingredients before compounding, except for composition 49, which had 20% water. To prepare the compositions for compounding, 3/4 of the added water was added to PVA and mixed by hand. In a separate container, the total amount of glycerol and the remaining portion of the water was added to the starch and mixed by hand. The two separate mixtures were then combined and mixed with a kitchen mixer. The final mixture was extruded through a laboratory twin-screw extruder fitted with compounding screws. The compounded material was chopped and then processed in a Brabender PL2000 torque rheometer fitted with high shear screw and a 1/2 inch blown film die. Films were clear and water resistant.</p><p>Compositions 52-58 had the BIS adipic polyester added to the chopped, compounded starch-PVA immediately before the blowing step. The mixtures were then processed in a Brabender PL2000 torque rheometer fitted with a high shear screw and a 1/2 inch blown film die. Compositions 46-50 were initially compounded.</p><p>Films were clear and tended to be water resistant when compared to a control film prepared as for compositions 52 or 53, but without any "BIS adipic" polyester (see Example 22 below).</p><p>When films are prepared from compositions containing PVA, they are nevertheless considerably less water sensitive than starch/PVA films as known to the art that do not contain the polyester component. Accordingly, where improved structural integrity, but only modest water resistance, is needed for film applications, such as in uses for agricultural mulches, then the PVA containing films of the invention are suitable, whereas for substantially complete water resistance then films such as illustrated by Example 20 are preferred.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 15______________________________________Compo-                                  Tensilesition Starch  PVA     EAA  Glycerol                             BisA  Strength                                         % E______________________________________46    38.25   38.25   0    13.5   10    19.0  149.947    34      34      0    12     20    19.7  187.248    34      34      0    12     20    22.1  204.449    50      15      0    15     20    9.7   72.250    34      34      0    12     20    14.17 51.251    32.8    32.8    2.4  12     20    12.7  289.852    36.9    36.9    2.7  13.5   10    22.0  131.453    32.8    32.8    2.4  12     20    23.5  196.854    45.9    27.9    2.7  13.5   10    19.6  101.255    40.8    24.8    2.4  12     20    19.6  135.156    36.9    36.9    2.7  13.5   10    25.6  135.257    36.9    36.9    2.7  13.5   10    16.2  115.658    48.8    16.8    2.4  12     20    6.2   22.6______________________________________</pre></p><heading>EXAMPLE 22</heading><p>The water uptake experiment described in Example 20 was repeated for compositions 52 and 53 but without the BIS adipic polymer. Without the BIS adipic polymer, the films absorbed 18% and 34% more water, correspondingly, to compositions 52 and 53.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 23</heading><p>Laminates of the invention were prepared as follows. Compression molded films of various of the hydroxy-functional polymers were prepared by compressing powders of the materials between Teflon-coated metal sheets in a Carver Press. Depending upon the particular hydroxy-functional polyester, temperatures of 100 of 1000 lbs. to 9000 lbs. were used to compression mold the synthetic resins into films. These films had thicknesses of 4 mil to 10 mil. Comparison compression films, analogous to those of the inventive laminate embodiments but composed of PHBV and PLA, were similarly prepared. These compression molded films were then coated onto various substrates. For example, in Table 16 23E was an inventive laminate embodiment in which BIS adipic was on (adhered to) a starch and PVOH blend film for direct comparison with comparative articles 23G and 23H where two separate synthetic polymers (not of the invention) were similarly on the same type of starch and PVOH blended film. Coating was accomplished by placing the films on one or both sides of the selected substrates, then placing the assembly between metal plates in a Carver press and compressing at elevated temperature and pressure. The so-compressed articles were then examined for adherence of the particular polyester to the substrate. Table 16 summarizes the data of these compression molded adherence studies.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 16______________________________________                Ease of Removal from                Substrate______________________________________Inventive CompressionMolded Laminate Embodiments23A  BIS Adipic Adhered to PVOH Film                      Impossible, Films                      Compressed into One23B  BIS Adipic Adhered to PHBV Film                      Impossible, Films                      Compressed into One23C  BIS Adipic Adhered to Cellulose Acetate                      Impossible, FilmsFilm                  Compressed into One23D  BIS Adipic Adhered to PLA Film                      Impossible, Films                      Compressed into One23E  BIS Adipic Adhered to Starch and PVOH                      DifficultFilm23F  BIS Adipic on Starch Tensile Bar                      DifficultComparative Compression Molded Articles23G  PVBV on Starch and PVOH Film                      Easy23H  PLA on Starch and PVOH Film                      Easy______________________________________</pre></p><p>As shown by the results summarized in Table 11, inventive compression molded laminate embodiments were so firmly adhered, or laminated, one layer to the other that the hydroxy-functional polyester layers were difficult to impossible to remove. By contrast, for the comparison compression molded articles, removal was easy. In particular, a comparison between the inventive embodiment 23E and the comparative articles 23G and 23H shows the self-adherent nature of hydroxy-functional polymers of the invention when compared with the two illustrated synthetic polyesters for comparison.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 24</heading><p>Extrusion blown BIS adipic and HQ-DDCA films were evaluated for their ability to form an adhesive layer between a third layer (a film of PHBV) and a starch foam tray surface. Sections of films about 6 inches by 8 inches were prepared. On one tray a section of BIS adipic film was placed on the upper surface of the tray and a film of PHBV was placed over this film. On a second tray a section of HQ-DDCA film was placed on the upper surface and a section of PHBV placed on top of this film. Each tray was then placed in the heated tray mold set at 100 closed for 30 seconds. Upon removal of the trays, the third, or outer layer, of PHBV film was adhered very tightly to the hydroxy-functional polyester films, which were adhered very tightly to the foam trays. The films could not be separated from the tray without removing portions of starch from the tray. Thus, the hydroxy-functional polyester layer served to adhere both the starch foam structure and the outermost PHBV layer in a laminated form, with the hydroxy-functional polyester sandwiched between. In the absence of the BIS adipic or HQ-DDCA films, films of PHBV could not be made to adhere to the starch foam trays.</p><p>Such a triple layer, laminated structure maybe desirable for certain applications since the outermost, or exterior, layer of a polymer such as PHBV has a higher melting temperature and is even more moisture resistant than the hydroxy-functional polyester used. This example thus illustrates multiple layer structures of the invention having extremely good heat resistance and moisture resistance.</p><p>It is to be understood that while the invention has been described above in conjunction with preferred specific embodiments, the description and examples are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>It is claimed:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
