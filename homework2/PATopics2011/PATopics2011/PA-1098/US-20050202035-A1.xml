The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to describe more fully the state of the art to which this invention pertains. </p><heading>TECHNICAL FIELD </heading><p num="p-0005"> The present invention relates generally to prevention and therapy of cancer and infectious disease. The invention is more specifically related to polypeptides comprising at least a portion of a stress protein, such as heat shock protein 110 (hsp110) or glucose-regulated protein 170 (grp170), complexed with an immunogenic polypeptide, and to polynucleotides encoding such stress proteins and immunogenic polypeptides, as well as antigen presenting cells that present the stress proteins and the immunogenic polypeptides. Such polypeptides, polynucleotides and antigen presenting cells may be used in vaccines and pharmaceutical compositions for the prevention and treatment of cancers and infectious diseases. The invention further relates to increasing the efficacy of stress protein complexes, such as by heating. </p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0006"> Cancer and infectious disease are significant health problems throughout the world. Although advances have been made in detection and therapy of these diseases, no vaccine or other universally successful method for prevention or treatment is currently available. Current therapies, which are generally based on a combination of chemotherapy or surgery and radiation, continue to prove inadequate in many patients. </p><p num="p-0007"> For example, primary breast carcinomas can often be treated effectively by surgical excision. If further disease recurs, however, additional treatment options are limited, and there are no effective means of treating systemic disease. While immune responses to autologous tumors have been observed, they have been ineffective in controlling the disease. One effort to stimulate a further anti-tumor response is directed at the identification of tumor antigens useful for vaccines. A related approach takes advantage of the promiscuous peptide binding properties of heat shock proteins, such as hsp70. These molecular chaperones bind peptides and are involved in numerous protein folding, transport and assembly processes, and could be involved in the antigen presentation pathway of MHC complexes. </p><p num="p-0008"> The heat shock proteins of mammalian cells can be classified into several families of sequence related proteins. The principal mammalian hsps, based on protein expression levels, are cytoplasmic/nuclear proteins with masses of (approximately) 25 kDa (hsp25), 70 kDa (hsp70), 90 kDa (hsp90), and 110 kDa (hsp110). However, in addition to hsps, a second set of stress proteins is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The induction of these stress proteins is not readily responsive to hyperthermic stress, as are the hsps, but are regulated by stresses that disrupt the function of the ER (e.g. glucose starvation and inhibitors of glycosylation, anoxia and reducing conditions, or certain agents that disrupt calcium homeostasis). These stress proteins are referred to as glucose regulated proteins (grps). The principal grps, on the basis of expression, have approximate sizes of 78 kDa (grp78), 94 kDa (grp94), and 170 kDa (grp170). Grp78 is homologous to cytoplasmic hsp70, while grp94 is homologous to hsp90. </p><p num="p-0009"> While individual stress proteins have been studied for several years (in some cases intensively studied, e.g. hsp70), the largest of the above hsp and grp groups, hsp110 and grp170, have received little attention. Both have been found by sequence analysis to represent large and highly diverged relatives of the hsp70 family. It is recognized that the hsp70 family, the hsp110 family, and the grp170 family comprise three distinguishable stress protein groups of eukaryotic cells that share a common evolutionary ancestor. The existence of hsp110 in parallel with hsp70 in the cytoplasm and of grp170 in parallel with grp78 in the ER of (apparently) all eukaryotic cells argues for important differential functions for these distantly related protein families. Not all stress proteins function as vaccines, however, and it can be expected that different ones may exhibit different activities. </p><p num="p-0010"> In spite of considerable research into therapies for infectious disease and cancer, these diseases remain difficult to diagnose and treat effectively. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved methods for treating cancer and infectious disease. The present invention fulfills these needs and further provides other related advantages. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0011"> The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a stress protein complex. The stress protein complex comprises an hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide and an immunogenic polypeptide. In some embodiments, the hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide is complexed with the immunogenic polypeptide, for example, by non-covalent interaction or by covalent interaction, including a fusion protein. In some embodiments, the complex is derived from a tumor. In other embodiments, the complex is derived from cells infected with an infectious agent. The immunogenic polypeptide of the stress protein complex can be associated with a cancer or an infectious disease. The stress protein complex of the invention can further include additional stress polypeptides, including members of the hsp70, hsp90, grp78 and grp94 stress protein families. In one embodiment, the stress protein complex comprises hsp110 complexed with hsp70 and/or hsp25. </p><p num="p-0012"> The invention additionally provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a first polynucleotide encoding an hsp110 or a grp170 polypeptide and a second polynucleotide encoding an immunogenic polypeptide. In some embodiments involving first and second polynucleotides, the first polynucleotide is linked to the second polynucleotide. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can further comprise a physiologically acceptable carrier and/or an adjuvant. The efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition can further comprise GM-CSF-secreting cells. Alternatively, GM-CSF-secreting cells can be co-administered with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, by administration before, during or after administration of the pharmaceutical composition. The use of GM-CSF-secreting cells enhances the efficacy of the pharmaceutical composition. </p><p num="p-0013"> In some embodiments, the complex is purified from a tumor or from cells infected with an infectious agent. In such embodiments, the stress polypeptide, as purified, is complexed with one or more immunogenic polypeptides. The binding of the stress polypeptide to the immunogenic polypeptide can be altered and/or enhanced by stress, such as by exposure to heat, anoxic and/or ischemic conditions, or proteotoxic stress. In particular, a stress protein complex of the invention can comprise a stress polypeptide complexed with an immunogenic polypeptide, wherein the complex has been heated. Such heating, particularly wherein the stress polypeptide comprises a heat-inducible stress protein, can increase the efficacy of the stress protein complex as a vaccine. Examples of heat-inducible stress proteins include, but are not limited to, hsp70 and hsp110. </p><p num="p-0014"> In some embodiments, the immunogenic polypeptide is known. Where the immunogenic polypeptide is a known molecule, the immunogenic polypeptide can be provided in admixture with the stress polypeptide, or as a complex with the stress polypeptide. The hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide can be complexed with the immunogenic polypeptide by non-covalent binding. Alternatively, the complex can comprise a fusion protein, wherein the stress polypeptide is linked to the immunogenic polypeptide. Examples of immunogenic polypeptides include, but are not limited to, antigens associated with cancer or infectious disease, such as the breast cancer antigen her2/neu or the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>antigens Mtb8.4 and Mtb39. Where the immunogenic polypeptide is unknown, it can be obtained incidentally to the purification of the stress polypeptide from tissue of a subject having cancer or an infectious disease. </p><p num="p-0015"> Also provided is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen-presenting cell (APC) modified to present an hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide and an immunogenic polypeptide. Alternatively, the APC can be modified to present an immunogenic polypeptide obtained by purification of hsp110 or grp170 from disease cells, including cancer cells and cells infected with an infectious agent. Preferably, the APC is a dendritic cell or a macrophage. The APC can be modified by various means including, but not limited to, peptide loading and transfection with a polynucleotide encoding an immunogenic polypeptide. </p><p num="p-0016"> The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered to a subject, thereby providing methods for inhibiting <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infection, for inhibiting tumor growth, for inhibiting the development of a cancer, and for the treatment or prevention of cancer or infectious disease. </p><p num="p-0017"> The invention further provides a method for producing T cells directed against a tumor cell. The method comprises contacting a T cell with an antigen presenting cell (APC), wherein the APC is modified to present an hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide and an immunogenic polypeptide associated with the tumor cell. Such T cells can be used in a method for killing a tumor cell, wherein the tumor cell is contacted with the T cell. Likewise, the invention provides a method for producing T cells directed against a <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infected cell, wherein a T cell is contacted with an APC that is modified to present an hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide and an immunogenic polypeptide associated with the <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infected cell. Included in the invention are T cells produced by this method and a pharmaceutical composition comprising such T cells. The T cells can be contacted with a <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infected cell in a method for killing a <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infected cell. The T cells can be CD4+ or CD8+. </p><p num="p-0018"> The invention also provides a method for removing tumor cells from a biological sample. The method comprises contacting a biological sample with a T cell of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the biological sample is blood or a fraction thereof. Also provided is a method for inhibiting tumor growth in a subject. The method comprises incubating CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells isolated from the subject with an antigen presenting cell (APC), wherein the APC is modified to present an hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide and an immunogenic polypeptide associated with the tumor cell such that T cells proliferate. The method further comprises administering to the subject an effective amount of the proliferated T cells, and thereby inhibiting tumor growth in the subject. In an alternative embodiment, the method for inhibiting tumor growth in a subject comprises incubating CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells isolated from the subject with an antigen presenting cell (APC), wherein the APC is modified to present an hsp110 or grp170 polypeptide and an immunogenic polypeptide associated with the tumor cell such that T cells proliferate, cloning at least one proliferated cell, and administering to the patient an effective amount of the cloned T cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth in the subject.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </heading><p num="p-0019"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows silver staining and analysis of purified hsp proteins.

The efficacy of these stress protein complexes has been demonstrated in both prophylactic and therapeutic contexts. The discovery of the ability of these stress proteins to facilitate an effective immune response provides a basis for their use in presenting a variety of antigens for use in prophylaxis and therapy of cancer and infectious disease. Because both hsp110 and grp170 have an enlarged peptide binding cleft and can stabilize unfolded peptide chains with greater efficiency relative to hsp70, these molecules can elicit different immunological reactions than previously obtained. </p><p num="h-0006"> Overview of Stress Proteins hsp110 and grp170 </p><p num="p-0073"> While the expression of most cellular proteins is significantly reduced in mammalian cells exposed to sudden elevations of temperature, heat shock proteins exhibit increased expression under these conditions. Heat shock proteins, which are produced in response to a variety of stressors, have the ability to bind other proteins in the non-native states (e.g., denatured by heating or guanidium chloride treatment), and in particular the ability to bind nascent peptides emerging from ribosomes or extruded from the endoplasmic reticulum (Hendrick and Hartl, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:349-384, 1993; Hartl, Nature 381:571-580, 1996). Heat shock proteins have also been shown to serve a chaperoning function, referring to their important role in the proper folding and assembly of proteins in the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Frydman et al., Nature 370:111-117, 1994). </p><p num="p-0074"> Mammalian heat shock protein families include hsp28, hsp70, hsp90 and hsp110. These primary heat shock proteins are found in the cytoplasm and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus. An additional set of stress proteins, known as glucose regulated proteins (grps), reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. The major families of glucose regulated proteins includes grp78, grp74 and grp170. This category of stress proteins lack heat shock elements in their promoters and are not inducible by heat, but by other stress conditions, such as anoxia. </p><p num="p-0075"> Hsp110 is an abundant and strongly inducible mammalian heat shock protein. Human hsp110 is also known as KIAA0201, NY-CO-25, HSP105 alpha and HSP105 beta. Mouse hsp110 is also known as HSP105 alpha, HSP105 beta, 42° C.-specific heat shock protein, and hsp-E7I. Hsp110 has an ATP binding beta sheet and alpha helical regions that are capable of binding peptides having greater size and different binding affinities as compared to hsp70. Hsp110 has also been shown to bind shorter peptides (12mers) and a preferred consensus motif for binding to hsp110 has been determined (i.e., basic, polar, aromatic/basic, proline, basic, acidic, aromatic, aromatic, basic, aromatic, proline, basic, X (no preference), basic/aromatic). This sequence differs from preferred sequence motifs previously identified to bind to members of the hsp70 family. </p><p num="p-0076"> Hsp110 is more efficient in stabilizing heat denatured proteins compared to hsp70, being four-fold more efficient on an equimolar basis. The peptide binding characteristics of hsp70 and hsp110 make them effective in inhibiting aggregation of denatured protein by binding to denatured peptide chain. Using two different denaturing conditions, heating and guanidium chloride exposure, hsp110 exhibits nearly total efficacy in inhibiting aggregation of these luciferase and citrate synthase when present in a 1:1 molar ratio. Hsp70 family members perform a similar function, but with significantly lower efficiency. Grp170 is a strong structural homolog to hsp110 that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (Lin et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 4:1109-19, 1993; Chen et al., FEBS Lett. 380:68-72, 1996). Grp170 exhibits the same secondary structural features of hsp110, including an enlarged peptide binding domain. Grp170 is predicted to contain a beta sheet domain near its center, a more C-terminal alpha-helical domain, and a loop domain connecting both that is much longer than the loop domain present in hsp110 (200 amino acids versus 100 amino acids in length) and absent in DnaK. In addition, grp170 is likely the critical ATPase required for protein import into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (Dierks et al., EMBO J. 15;6931-42, 1996). Grp170 is also known as ORP150 (oxygen-regulated protein identified in both human and rat) and as CBP-140 (calcium binding protein identified in mouse). Grp170 has been shown to stabilize denatured protein more efficiently than hsp70. </p><p num="p-0077"> The discovery disclosed herein that both grp170 and hsp110 function as vaccines provides the capability for novel and more effective vaccines for use in the treatment and prevention of cancer and infectious disease than previously available strategies. </p><p num="h-0007"> Definitions </p><p num="p-0078"> All scientific and technical terms used in this application have meanings commonly used in the art unless otherwise specified.

Proteins that are tumor proteins also react detectably within an immunoassay (such as an ELISA) with antisera from a patient with cancer. </p><p num="p-0086"> As used herein, a “heat-inducible stress polypeptide” means a stress polypeptide or protein whose expression is induced by elevated temperature. One example of a heat-inducible stress polypeptide comprises a stress protein that contains one or more heat shock elements in its promoter. </p> <p num="p-0087"> An “immunogenic polypeptide,” as used herein, is a portion of a protein that is recognized (i.e., specifically bound) by a B-cell and/or T-cell surface antigen receptor. Such immunogenic polypeptides generally comprise at least 5 amino acid residues, more preferably at least 10, and still more preferably at least 20 amino acid residues of a protein associated with cancer or infectious disease. Certain preferred immunogenic polypeptides include peptides in which an N-terminal leader sequence and/or transmembrane domain have been deleted. Other preferred immunogenic polypeptides may contain a small N- and/or C-terminal deletion (e.g., 1-30 amino acids, preferably 5-15 amino acids), relative to the mature protein. </p><p num="p-0088"> As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any material which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline or normal (0.9%/) saline. </p><p num="p-0089"> Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapter 43, 14th Ed., Mack Publishing Co, Easton Pa. 18042, USA). </p><p num="p-0090"> As used herein, “adjuvant” includes those adjuvants commonly used in the art to facilitate an immune response. Examples of adjuvants include, but are not limited to, helper peptide; aluminum salts such as aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminum phosphate; Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete Adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.); Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and Company, Inc., Rahway, N.J.); AS-2 (Smith-Kline Beecham); QS-21 (Aquilla Biopharmaceuticals); MPL or 3d-MPL (Corixa Corporation, Hamilton, Mont.); LEIF; salts of calcium, iron or zinc; an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine; acylated sugars; -cationically or anionically derivatized polysaccharides; polyphosphazenes; biodegradable microspheres; monophosphoryl lipid A and quil A; muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine or an immunostimulating complex, including cytokines (e.g., GM-CSF or interleukin-2, -7 or -12) and immunostimulatory DNA sequences.

In some embodiments, the first and second polynucleotides are linked to form a single polynucleotide that encodes a stress protein complex. The single polynucleotide can express the first and second proteins in a variety of ways, for example, as a single fusion protein or as two separate proteins capable of forming a complex. </p> <p num="p-0093"> Preferred polynucleotides comprise at least 15 consecutive nucleotides, preferably at least 30 consecutive nucleotides and more preferably at least 45 consecutive nucleotides, that encode a portion of a stress protein or immunogenic polypeptide. More preferably, the first polynucleotide encodes a peptide binding portion of a stress protein and the second polynucleotide encodes an immunogenic portion of an immunogenic polypeptide. Polynucleotides complementary to any such sequences are also encompassed by the present invention. Polynucleotides may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA molecules. RNA molecules include HnRNA molecules, which contain introns and correspond to a DNA molecule in a one-to-one manner, and mRNA molecules, which do not contain introns. Additional coding or non-coding sequences may, but need not, be present within a polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but need not, be linked to other molecules and/or support materials. </p><p num="p-0094"> Polynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous sequence that encodes a stress protein, immunogenic polypeptide or a portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Polynucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions and/or insertions such that the immunogenicity of the encoded polypeptide is not diminished, relative to a native stress protein. The effect on the immunogenicity of the encoded polypeptide may generally be assessed as described herein. Variants preferably exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably at least about 80% identity and most preferably at least about 90% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native stress protein or a portion thereof </p><p num="p-0095"> Two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are said to be “identical” if the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A “comparison window” as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, 40 to about 50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. </p><p num="p-0096"> Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted using the Megalign program in the Lasergene suite of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.), using default parameters. This program embodies several alignment schemes described in the following references: Dayhoff, M. O. (1978) A model of evolutionary change in proteins—Matrices for detecting distant relationships. In Dayhoff, M. O. (ed.) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington D.C. Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 345-358; Hein J. (1990) Unified Approach to Alignment and Phylogenes pp. 626-645 Methods in Enzymology vol. 183, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; Higgins, D. G. and Sharp, P. M. (1989) CABIOS 5:151-153; Myers, E. W. and Muller W. (1988) CABIOS 4:11-17; Robinson, E. D. (1971) Comb. Theor. 11:105; Santou, N., Nes, M. (1987) Mol. Biol. Evol. 4:406-425; Sneath, P. H.

USA 80:726-730. </p><p num="p-0097"> Preferably, the “percentage of sequence identity” is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a window of comparison of at least 20 positions, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e. gaps) of 20 percent or less, usually 5 to 15 percent, or 10 to 12 percent, as compared to the reference sequences (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid bases or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the reference sequence (i.e. the window size) and multiplying the results by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. </p><p num="p-0098"> Variants may also, or alternatively, be substantially homologous to a native gene, or a portion or complement thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybridizing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally occurring DNA sequence encoding a native stress protein (or a complementary sequence). Suitable moderately stringent conditions include prewashing in a solution of 5×SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50° C.-65° C., 5×SSC, overnight; followed by washing twice at 65° C. for 20 minutes with each of 2×, 0.5× and 0.2×SSC containing 0.1% SDS. </p><p num="p-0099"> It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that, as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, there are many nucleotide sequences that encode a polypeptide as described herein. Some of these polynucleotides bear minimal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any native gene. Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to differences in codon usage are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Further, alleles of the genes comprising the polynucleotide sequences provided herein are within the scope of the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are altered as a result of one or more mutations, such as deletions, additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The resulting mRNA and protein may, but need not, have an altered structure or function. Alleles may be identified using standard techniques (such as hybridization, amplification and/or database sequence comparison). </p><p num="p-0100"> Polynucleotides may be prepared using any of a variety of techniques known in the art. DNA encoding a stress protein may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue expressing a stress protein mRNA. Accordingly, human hsp110 or grp170 DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue. The stress protein-encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by oligonucleotide synthesis. Libraries can be screened with probes (such as antibodies to the stress protein or oligonucleotides of at least about 20-80 bases) designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Illustrative libraries include human liver cDNA library (human liver 5′ stretch plus cDNA, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and mouse kidney cDNA library (mouse kidney 5′-stretch cDNA, Clontech laboratories, Inc.). Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures, such as those described in Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual </i>(New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding hsp110 or grp170 is to use PCR methodology (Sambrook et al., supra; Dieffenbach et al., <i>PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual </i>(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995)). </p><p num="p-0101"> The oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be sufficiently long and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art, and include the use of radiolabels, such as <sup>32</sup>P-labeled ATP, biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions, including moderate stringency and high stringency, are provided in Sambrook et al., supra. </p><p num="p-0102"> Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity (at either the amino acid or nucleotide level) within defined regions of the molecule or across the full-length sequence can be determined through sequence alignment using computer software programs, which employ various algorithms to measure homology. </p><p num="p-0103"> Nucleic acid molecules having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries, and, if necessary, using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al., supra, to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse-transcribed into cDNA. </p><p num="p-0104"> Polynucleotide variants may generally be prepared by any method known in the art, including chemical synthesis by, for example, solid phase phosphoramidite chemical synthesis. Modifications in a polynucleotide sequence may also be introduced using standard mutagenesis techniques, such as oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis (see Adelman et al., DNA 2:183, 1983). Alternatively, RNA molecules may be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding a stress protein, or portion thereof, provided that the DNA is incorporated into a vector with a suitable RNA polymerase promoter (such as T7 or SP6). Certain portions may be used to prepare an encoded polypeptide, as described herein. In addition, or alternatively, a portion may be administered to a patient such that the encoded polypeptide is generated in vivo (e.g., by transfecting antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, with a cDNA construct encoding a stress polypeptide, and administering the transfected cells to the patient). </p><p num="p-0105"> Any polynucleotide may be further modified to increase stability in vivo. Possible modifications include, but are not limited to, the addition of flanking sequences at the 5′ and/or 3′ ends; the use of phosphorothioate or 2′ O-methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages in the backbone; and/or the inclusion of nontraditional bases such as inosine, queosine and wybutosine, as well as acetyl- methyl-, thio- and other modified forms of adenine, cytidine, guanine, thymine and uridine. </p><p num="p-0106"> Nucleotide sequences can be joined to a variety of other nucleotide sequences using established recombinant DNA techniques. For example, a polynucleotide may be cloned into any of a variety of cloning vectors, including plasmids, phagemids, lambda phage derivatives and cosmids. Vectors of particular interest include expression vectors, replication vectors, probe generation vectors and sequencing vectors. In general, a vector will contain an origin of replication functional in at least one organism, convenient restriction endonuclease sites and one or more selectable markers. Other elements will depend upon the desired use, and will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </p><p num="p-0107"> Within certain embodiments, polynucleotides may be formulated so as to permit entry into a cell of a mammal, and to permit expression therein. Such formulations are particularly useful for therapeutic purposes, as described below. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are many ways to achieve expression of a polynucleotide in a target cell, and any suitable method may be employed. For example, a polynucleotide may be incorporated into a viral vector such as, but not limited to, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, or vaccinia or other pox virus (e.g., avian pox virus). Techniques for incorporating DNA into such vectors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A retroviral vector may additionally transfer or incorporate a gene for a selectable marker (to aid in the identification or selection of transduced cells) and/or a targeting moiety, such as a gene that encodes a ligand for a receptor on a specific target cell, to render the vector target specific. Targeting may also be accomplished using an antibody, by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </p><p num="p-0108"> Other formulations for therapeutic purposes include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. A preferred colloidal system for use as a delivery vehicle in vitro and in vivo is a liposome (i.e., an artificial membrane vesicle). The preparation and use of such systems is well known in the art. </p><p num="h-0009"> Stress Polypeptides and Immunogenic Polypeptides </p><p num="p-0109"> Within the context of the present invention, stress polypeptides and stress proteins comprise at least a peptide binding portion of an hsp110 and/or grp170 protein and/or a variant thereof. Polypeptides as described herein may be of any length. Additional sequences derived from the native protein and/or heterologous sequences may be present, and such sequences may, but need not, possess further peptide binding, immunogenic or antigenic properties. In some embodiments, the stress polypeptide further includes all or a portion of a member of the hsp70, hsp90, grp78 and grp94 stress protein families. </p><p num="p-0110"> Functional domains and variants of hsp110 that are capable of mediating the chaperoning and peptide binding activities of hsp110 are identified in Oh, H J et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274(22):15712-18, 1999. Functional domains of grp170 parallel those of hsp110. Candidate fragments and variants of the stress polypeptides disclosed herein can be identified as having chaperoning activity by assessing their ability to solubilize heat-denatured luciferase and to refold luciferase in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Oh et al., supra). </p><p num="p-0111"> In some embodiments, the immunogenic polypeptide is associated with a cancer or precancerous condition. One example of an immunogenic polypeptide associated with a cancer is a her-2/neu peptide (Bargmann et al., 1986, Nature 319(6050):226-30; Bargmann et al., 1986, Cell 45(5):649-57). Examples of her-2/neu peptides include, but are not limited to, the intracellular domain of her-2/neu (amino acid residues 676-1255; see Bargmann et al. references above), p369 (also known as E75; KIFGSLAFL; SEQ ID NO: 6) of the extracellular domain of her-2/neu, and p546, a transmembrane region of her-2/neu (VLQGLPREYV; SEQ ID NO: 5). In other embodiments, the immunogenic polypeptide is associated with an infectious disease. One example of an immunogenic polypeptide associated with an infectious disease is an antigen derived from <i>M. tuberculosis, </i>such as <i>M. tuberculosis </i>antigens Mtb 8.4 (Coler et al., 1998, J. Immunol. 161(5):2356-64) or Mtb 39 (also known as Mtb39A; Dillon et al., 1999, Infect. Immun. 67(6):2941-50). </p><p num="p-0112"> The immunogenic polypeptide may be known or unknown. Unknown immunogenic polypeptides can be obtained incidentally to the purification of hsp110 or grp170 from tissue of a subject having cancer or a precancerous condition or having an infectious disease. In other embodiments, the immunogenic polypeptide comprises a known antigen. </p><p num="p-0113"> Immunogenic polypeptides may generally be identified using well known techniques, such as those summarized in Paul, Fundamental Immunology, 4th ed., 663-665 (Lippincott-Raven Publishers, 1999) and references cited therein. Such techniques include screening polypeptides for the ability to react with antigen-specific antibodies, antisera and/or T-cell lines or clones. As used herein, antisera and antibodies are antigen-specific if they specifically bind to an antigen (i.e., they react with the protein in an ELISA or other immunoassay, and do not react detectably with unrelated proteins). Such antisera and antibodies may be prepared using well known techniques. An immunogenic polypeptide can be a portion of a native protein that reacts with such antisera and/or T-cells at a level that is not substantially less than the reactivity of the full length polypeptide (e.g., in an ELISA and/or T-cell reactivity assay). Such immunogenic portions may react within such assays at a level that is similar to or greater than the reactivity of the full length polypeptide. Such screens may generally be performed using -methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988. For example, a polypeptide may be immobilized on a solid support and contacted with patient sera to allow binding of antibodies within the sera to the immobilized polypeptide. Unbound sera may then be removed and bound antibodies detected using, for example, <sup>125</sup>I-labeled Protein A. </p><p num="p-0114"> Stress protein complexes of the invention can be obtained through a variety of methods. In one example, a recombinant hsp110 or grp170 is mixed with cellular material (e.g., lysate), to permit binding of the stress polypeptide with one or more immunogenic polypeptides within the cellular material. Such binding can be enhanced or altered by stress conditions, such as heating of the mixture. In another example, target cells are transfected with hsp110 or grp170 that has been tagged (e.g., HIS tag) for later purification. This example provides a method of producing recombinant stress polypeptide in the presence of immunogenic material. In yet another example, heat or other stress conditions are used to induce hsp110 or grp170 in target cells prior to purification of the stress polypeptide. This stressing can be performed in situ, in vitro or in cell cultures). </p><p num="p-0115"> In some embodiments, the invention provides a stress protein complex having enhanced immunogenicity that comprises a stress polypeptide and an immunogenic polypeptide, wherein the complex has been heated. Such heating, particularly wherein the stress polypeptide comprises a heat-inducible stress protein, can increase the efficacy of the stress protein complex as a vaccine. Examples of heat-inducible stress proteins include, but are not limited to, hsp70 and hsp110. In one embodiment, heating comprises exposing tissue including the stress protein complex to a temperature of at least approximately 38° C., and gradually increasing the temperature, e.g. by 1° C. at a time, until the desired level of heating is obtained. Preferably, the temperature of the tissue is brought to approximately 39.5° C., ±0.5° C. At the time of heating, the tissue can be in vivo, in vitro or positioned within a host environment. </p><p num="p-0116"> A stress protein complex of the invention can comprise a variant of a native stress protein. A polypeptide “variant,” as used herein, is a polypeptide that differs from a native stress protein in one or more substitutions, deletions, additions and/or insertions, such that the immunogenicity of the polypeptide is not substantially diminished. In other words, the ability of a variant to react with antigen-specific antisera may be enhanced or unchanged, relative to the native protein, or may be diminished by less than 50%, and preferably less than 20%, relative to the native protein. Such variants may generally be identified by modifying one of the above polypeptide sequences and evaluating the reactivity of the modified polypeptide with antigen-specific antibodies or antisera as described herein. Preferred variants include those in which one or more portions, such as an N-terminal leader sequence or transmembrane domain, have been removed. Other preferred variants include variants in which a small portion (e.g., 1-30 amino acids, preferably 5-15 amino acids) has been removed from the N- and/or C-terminal of the mature protein. </p><p num="p-0117"> Polypeptide variants preferably exhibit at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 90% and most preferably at least about 95% identity (determined as described above) to the identified polypeptides. </p><p num="p-0118"> Preferably, a variant contains conservative substitutions. A “conservative substitution” is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid that has similar properties, such that one skilled in the art of peptide chemistry would expect the secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide to be substantially unchanged. Amino acid substitutions may generally be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues. For example, negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid; positively charged amino acids include lysine and arginine; and amino acids with uncharged polar head groups having similar hydrophilicity values include leucine, isoleucine and valine; glycine and alanine; asparagine and glutamine; and serine, threonine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Other groups of amino acids that may represent conservative changes include: (1) ala, pro, gly, glu, asp, gln, asn, ser, thr; (2) cys, ser, tyr, thr; (3) val, ile, leu, met, ala, phe; (4) lys, arg, his; and (5) phe, tyr, trp, his. A variant may also, or alternatively, contain nonconservative changes. In a preferred embodiment, variant polypeptides differ from a native sequence by substitution, deletion or addition of five amino acids or fewer. Variants may also (or alternatively) be modified by, for example, the deletion or addition of amino acids that have minimal influence on the immunogenicity, secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide. </p><p num="p-0119"> Polypeptides may comprise a signal (or leader) sequence at the N-terminal end of the protein that co-translationally or post-translationally directs transfer of the protein. The polypeptide may also be conjugated to a linker or other sequence for ease of synthesis, purification or identification of the polypeptide (e.g., poly-FEs), or to enhance binding of the polypeptide to a solid support. For example, a polypeptide may be conjugated to an immnunoglobulin Fc region. </p><p num="p-0120"> Polypeptides may be prepared using any of a variety of well known techniques, including the purification techniques described in Example 1 below. In one embodiment, the stress polypeptide(s) and immunogenic polypeptide(s) are co-purified from tumor cells or cells infected with a pathogen as a result of the purification technique. In some embodiments, the tumor cells or infected cells are stressed prior to purification to enhance binding of the immunogenic polypeptide to the stress polypeptide. For example, the cells can be stressed in vitro by several hours of low-level heating (39.5-40° C.) or about 1 to about 2 hours of high-level heating (approximately 43° C.). In addition, the cells can be stressed in vitro by exposure to anoxic and/or ischemic or proteotoxic conditions. Tumors removed from a subject can be minced and heated in vitro prior to purification. </p><p num="p-0121"> In some embodiments, the polypeptides are purified from the same subject to whom the composition will be administered. In these embodiments, it may be desirable to increase the number of tumor or infected cells. Such a scale up of cells could be performed in vitro or in vivo, using, for example, a SCID mouse system. Where the cells are scaled up in the presence of non-human cells, such as by growing a human subject's tumor in a SCID mouse host, care should be taken to purify the human cells from any non-human (e.g., mouse) cells that may have infiltrated the tumor. In these embodiments in which the composition will be administered to the same subject from whom the polypeptides are purified, it may also be desirable purify both hsp110 and grp170 as well as additional stress polypeptides to optimize the efficacy of a limited quantity of starting material. </p><p num="p-0122"> Recombinant polypeptides encoded by DNA sequences as described above may be readily prepared from the DNA sequences using any of a variety of expression vectors known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Expression may be achieved in any appropriate host cell that has been transformed or transfected with an expression vector containing a DNA molecule that encodes a recombinant polypeptide. Suitable host cells include prokaryotes, yeast and higher eukaryotic cells. Preferably, the host cells employed are <i>E. coli, </i>yeast, insect cells or a mammalian cell line such as COS or CHO. Supernatants from suitable host/vector systems that secrete recombinant protein or polypeptide into culture media may be first concentrated using a commercially available filter. Following concentration, the concentrate may be applied to a suitable purification matrix such as an affinity matrix or an ion exchange resin. Finally, one or more reverse phase HPLC steps can be employed to farther purify a recombinant polypeptide. </p><p num="p-0123"> Portions and other variants having fewer than about 100 amino acids, and generally fewer than about 50 amino acids, may also be generated by synthetic means, using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such polypeptides may be synthesized using any of the commercially available solid-phase techniques, such as the Merrifield solid-phase synthesis method, where amino acids are sequentially added to a growing amino acid chain. See Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2146, 1963. Equipment for automated synthesis of polypeptides is commercially available from suppliers such as Perkin Elmer/Applied BioSystems Division (Foster City, Calif.), and may be operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. </p><p num="p-0124"> Polypeptides can be synthesized on a Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems Division 430A peptide synthesizer using FMOC chemistry with HPTU (O-BenzotriazoleN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) activation. A Gly-Cys-Gly sequence may be attached to the amino terminus of the peptide to provide a method of conjugation, binding to an immobilized surface, or labeling of the peptide. Cleavage of the peptides from the solid support may be carried out using the following cleavage mixture: trifluoroacetic acid:ethanedithiol:thioanisole:water:phenol (40:1:2:2:3). After cleaving for 2 hours, the peptides may be precipitated in cold methyl-t-butyl-ether. The peptide pellets may then be dissolved in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and lyophilized prior to purification by C18 reverse phase HPLC. A gradient of 0%-60% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% TFA) in water may be used to elute the peptides. Following lyophilization of the pure fractions, the peptides may be characterized using electrospray or other types of mass spectrometry and by amino acid analysis. </p><p num="h-0010"> Fusion Proteins </p><p num="p-0125"> In some embodiments, the polypeptide is a fusion protein that comprises multiple polypeptides as described herein, or that comprises at least one polypeptide as described herein and an unrelated sequence. In some embodiments, the fusion protein comprises a stress polypeptide of hsp110 and/or grp170 and an immunogenic polypeptide. The immunogenic polypeptide can comprise all or a portion of a tumor protein or a protein associated with an infectious disease. </p><p num="p-0126"> Additional fusion partners can be added. A fusion partner may, for example, serve as an immunological fusion partner by assisting in the provision of T helper epitopes, preferably T helper epitopes recognized by humans. As another example, a fusion partner may serve as an expression enhancer, assisting in expressing the protein at higher yields than the native recombinant protein. Certain preferred fusion partners are both immunological and expression enhancing fusion partners. Other fusion partners may be selected so as to increase the solubility of the protein or to enable the protein to be targeted to desired intracellular compartments. Still further fusion partners include affinity tags, which facilitate purification of the protein. </p><p num="p-0127"> Fusion proteins may generally be prepared using standard techniques, including chemical conjugation. Preferably, a fusion protein is expressed as a recombinant protein, allowing the production of increased levels, relative to a non-fused protein, in an expression system. Briefly, DNA sequences encoding the polypeptide components may be assembled separately, and ligated into an appropriate expression vector. The 3′ end of the DNA sequence encoding one polypeptide component is ligated, with or without a peptide linker, to the 5′ end of a DNA sequence encoding the second polypeptide component so that the reading frames of the sequences are in phase. This permits translation into a single fusion protein that retains the biological activity of both component polypeptides. </p><p num="p-0128"> A peptide linker sequence may be employed to separate the first and the second polypeptide components by a distance sufficient to ensure that each polypeptide folds into its secondary and tertiary structures. Such a peptide linker sequence is incorporated into the fusion protein using standard techniques well known in the art. Suitable peptide linker sequences may be chosen based on the following factors: (1) their ability to adopt a flexible extended conformation; (2) their inability to adopt a secondary structure that could interact with functional epitopes on the first and second polypeptides; and (3) the lack of hydrophobic or charged residues that might react with the polypeptide functional epitopes. Preferred peptide linker sequences contain Gly, Asn and Ser residues. Other near neutral amino acids, such as Thr and Ala may also be used in the linker sequence. Amino acid sequences which may be usefully employed as linkers include those disclosed in Maratea et al., Gene 40:39-46, 1985; Murphy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:8258-8262, 1986; U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,233 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,180. The linker sequence may generally be from 1 to about 50 amino acids in length. Linker sequences are not required when the first and second polypeptides have non-essential N-terminal amino acid regions that can be used to separate the functional domains and prevent steric interference. </p><p num="p-0129"> The ligated DNA sequences are operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements. The regulatory elements responsible for expression of DNA are located 5′ to the DNA sequence encoding the first polypeptides. Similarly, stop codons required to end translation and transcription termination signals ate present 3′ to the DNA sequence encoding the second polypeptide. </p><p num="p-0130"> Fusion proteins ate also provided that comprise a polypeptide of the present invention together with an unrelated immunogenic protein. Preferably the immunogenic protein is capable of eliciting a memory response. Examples of such proteins include tetanus, tuberculosis and hepatitis proteins (see, for example, Stoute et al., New Engl. J. Med. 336:86-91, 1997). </p><p num="p-0131"> Within preferred embodiments, an immunological fusion partner is derived from protein D, a surface protein of the gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenza B (WO 91/18926). Preferably, a protein D derivative comprises approximately the first third of the protein (e.g., the first N-terminal 100-110 amino acids), and a protein D derivative may be lipidated. Within certain preferred embodiments, the first 109 residues of a Lipoprotein D fusion partner is included on the N-terminus to provide the polypeptide with additional exogenous T-cell epitopes and to increase the expression level in <i>E. coli </i>(thus functioning as an expression enhancer). The lipid tail ensures optimal presentation of the antigen to antigen presenting cells. Other fusion partners include the non-structural protein from influenzae virus, NS I (hemaglutinin). Typically, the N-terminal 81 amino acids are used, although different fragments that include T-helper epitopes may be used. </p><p num="p-0132"> In another embodiment, the immunological fusion partner is the protein known as LYTA, or a portion thereof (preferably a C-terminal portion). LYTA is derived from <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae, </i>which synthesizes an N-acetyl-L-alanine amidase known as amidase LYTA (encoded by the LytA gene; Gene 43:265-292, 1986). LYTA is an autolysin that specifically degrades certain bonds in the peptidoglycan backbone. The C-terminal domain of the LYTA protein is responsible for the affinity to the choline or to some choline analogues such as DEAR This property has been exploited for the development of <i>E. coli </i>CLYTA expressing plasmids useful for expression of fusion proteins. Purification of hybrid proteins containing the C-LYTA fragment at the amino terminus has been described (see Biotechnology 10:795-798, 1992). Within a preferred embodiment, a repeat portion of LYTA may be incorporated into a fusion protein. A repeat portion is found in the C-terminal region starting at residue 178. A particularly preferred repeat portion incorporates residues 188-305. </p><p num="p-0133"> In general, polypeptides (including fusion proteins) and polynucleotides as described herein are isolated. An “isolated” polypeptide or polynucleotide is one that is removed from its original environment. For example, a naturally occurring protein is isolated if it is separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system. </p><p num="p-0134"> Preferably, such polypeptides are at least about 90% pure, more preferably at least about 95% pure and most preferably at least about 99% pure. A polynucleotide is considered to be isolated if, for example, it is cloned into a vector that is not a part of the natural environment. </p><p num="h-0011"> T Cells </p><p num="p-0135"> Immunotherapeutic compositions may also, or alternatively, comprise T cells specific for a stress protein complexed with an immunogenic polypeptide (“stress protein complex”). Such cells may generally be prepared in vitro or ex vivo, using standard procedures. For example, T cells may be isolated from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or a fraction of bone marrow or peripheral blood of a patient, using a commercially available cell separation system, such as the ISOLEX™ magnetic cell selection system, available from Nexell Therapeutics, Irvine, Calif. (see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,475); or MACS cell separation technology from Miltenyi Biotec, including Pan T Cell Isolation Kit, CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit, and CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit (see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,240,856; U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,926; WO 89/06280; WO 91/16116 and WO 92/07243). Alternatively, T cells may be derived from related or unrelated humans, non-human mammals, cell lines or cultures. </p><p num="p-0136"> T cells may be stimulated with a stress protein complex, polynucleotide encoding a stress protein complex and/or an antigen presenting cell (APC) that expresses such a stress protein complex. The stimulation is performed under conditions and for a time sufficient to permit the generation of T cells that are specific for the polypeptide. Preferably, a stress polypeptide or polynucleotide is present within a delivery vehicle, such as a microsphere, to facilitate the generation of specific T cells. </p><p num="p-0137"> T cells are considered to be specific for a stress polypeptide if the T cells kill target cells coated with the polypeptide or expressing a gene encoding the polypeptide. T cell specificity may be evaluated using any of a variety of standard techniques. For example, within a chromium release assay or proliferation assay, a stimulation index of more than two fold increase in lysis and/or proliferation, compared to negative controls, indicates T cell specificity. Such assays may be performed, for example, as described in Chen et al., Cancer Res. 54:1065-1070, 1994. </p><p num="p-0138"> Detection of the proliferation of T cells may be accomplished by a variety of known techniques. For example, T cell proliferation can be detected by measuring an increased rate of DNA synthesis (e.g., by pulse-labeling cultures of T cells with tritiated thymidine and measuring the amount of tritiated thymidine incorporated into DNA). Contact with a stress protein complex (100 ng/ml-100 μg/ml, preferably 200 ng/ml-25 μg/ml) for 3-7 days should result in at least a two fold increase in proliferation of the T cells. Contact as described above for 2-3 hours should result in activation of the T cells, as measured using standard cytokine assays in which a two fold increase in the level of cytokine release (e.g., TNF or IFN-γ) is indicative of T cell activation (see Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology, vol. 1, Wiley Interscience (Greene 1998)). T cells that have been activated in response to a stress polypeptide, polynucleotide or polypeptide-expressing APC may be CD4+ and/or CD8+. T cells can be expanded using standard techniques. </p><p num="p-0139"> Within preferred embodiments, the T cells are derived from either a patient or a related, or unrelated, donor and are administered to the patient following stimulation and expansion. For therapeutic purposes, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells that proliferate in response to a stress polypeptide, polynucleotide or APC can be expanded in number either in vitro or in vivo. Proliferation of such T cells in vitro may be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, the T cells can be re-exposed to a stress polypeptide complexed with an immunogenic polypeptide, with or without the addition of T cell growth factors, such as interleukin-2, and/or stimulator cells that synthesize a stress protein complex. Alternatively, one or more T cells that proliferate in the presence of a stress protein complex can be expanded in number by cloning. Methods for cloning cells are well known in the art, and include limiting dilution. </p><p num="h-0012"> Pharmaceutical Compositions and Vaccines </p><p num="p-0140"> The invention provides stress protein complex polypeptides, polynucleotides, T cells and/or antigen presenting cells that are incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions, including immunogenic compositions (i.e., vaccines). Pharmaceutical compositions comprise one or more such compounds and, optionally, a physiologically acceptable carrier. Vaccines may comprise one or more such compounds and an adjuvant that serves as a non-specific immune response enhancer. The adjuvant may be any substance that enhances an immune response to an exogenous antigen. Examples of adjuvants include conventional adjuvants, biodegradable microspheres (e.g., polylactic galactide), immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and liposomes (into which the compound is incorporated; see e.g., Fullerton, U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,877). Vaccine preparation is generally described in, for example, M. F. Powell and M. J. Newman, eds., “Vaccine Design (the subunit and adjuvant approach),” Plenum Press (NY, 1995). Pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines within the scope of the present invention may also contain other compounds that may be biologically active or inactive. For example, one or more immunogenic portions of other tumor antigens may be present, either incorporated into a fusion polypeptide or as a separate compound, within the composition or vaccine. </p><p num="p-0141"> A pharmaceutical composition or vaccine can contain DNA encoding one or more of the polypeptides as described above, such that the polypeptide is generated in situ. As noted above, the DNA may be present within any of a variety of delivery systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including nucleic acid expression systems, bacteria and viral expression systems. Numerous gene delivery techniques are well known in the art, such as those described by Rolland, Crit. Rev. Therap. Drug Carrier Systems 15:143-198, 1998, and references cited therein. Appropriate nucleic acid expression systems contain the necessary DNA sequences for expression in the patient (such as a suitable promoter and terminating signal). Bacterial delivery systems involve the administration of a bacterium (such as <i>Bacillus</i>-<i>Calmette</i>-<i>Guerrin</i>) that expresses an immunogenic portion of the polypeptide on its cell surface or secretes such an epitope. </p><p num="p-0142"> In a preferred embodiment, the DNA may be introduced using a viral expression system (e.g., vaccinia or other pox virus, retrovirus, or adenovirus), which may involve the use of a non-pathogenic (defective), replication competent virus. Suitable systems are disclosed, for example, in Fisher-Hoch et al., Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA 86:317-321, 1989; Flexner et al., Ann. N. Y. Acad Sci. 569:86-103, 1989; Flexner et al., Vaccine 8:17-21, 1990; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,603,112, 4,769,330, and 5,017,487; WO 89/01973; U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,127; GB 2,200,651; EP 0,345,242; WO 91/02805; Berkner-Biotechniques 6:616-627, 1988; Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431-434, 1991; Kolls et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:215-219, 1994; Kass-Eisler et al., Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA 90:11498-11502, 1993; Guzman et al., Circulation 88:2838-2848, 1993; and Guzman et al., Cir. Res. 73:1202-1207, 1993. Techniques for incorporating DNA into such expression systems are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The DNA may also be “naked,” as described, for example, in Ulmer et al., Science 259:1745-1749, 1993 and reviewed by Cohen, Science 259:1691-1692, 1993. The uptake of naked DNA may be increased by coating the DNA onto biodegradable beads, which are efficiently transported into the cells. </p><p num="p-0143"> While any suitable carrier known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, the type of carrier will vary depending on the mode of administration. Compositions of the present invention may be formulated for any appropriate manner of administration, including for example, topical, oral, nasal, intravenous, intracranial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. For parenteral administration, such as subcutaneous injection, the carrier preferably comprises water, saline, alcohol, a fat, a wax or a buffer. For oral administration, any of the above carriers or a solid carrier, such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, and magnesium carbonate, may be employed. Biodegradable microspheres (e.g., polylactate polyglycolate) may also be employed as carriers for the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention. Suitable biodegradable microspheres are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,268 and 5,075,109. </p><p num="p-0144"> Such compositions may also comprise buffers (e.g., neutral buffered saline or phosphate buffered saline), carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans), mannitol, proteins, polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine, antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione, adjuvants (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) and/or preservatives. Alternatively, compositions of the present invention may be formulated as a lyophilizate. Compounds may also be encapsulated within liposomes using well known technology. Any of a variety of adjuvants may be employed in the vaccines of this invention. Most adjuvants contain a substance designed to protect the antigen from rapid catabolism, such as aluminum hydroxide or mineral oil, and a stimulator of immune responses, such as lipid A, <i>Bortadella pertussis </i>or <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>derived proteins. Suitable adjuvants are commercially available as, for example, Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete Adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.); Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and Company, Inc., Rahway, N.J.); aluminum salts such as aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminum phosphate; salts of calcium, iron or zinc; an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine acylated sugars; cationically or anionically derivatized polysaccharides; polyphosphazenes biodegradable microspheres; monophosphoryl lipid A and quil A. Cytokines, such as GM CSF or interleukin-2, -7, or -12, may also be used as adjuvants. </p><p num="p-0145"> Within the vaccines provided herein, the adjuvant composition is preferably designed to induce an immune response predominantly of the Th1 type. High levels of Th1-type cytokines (e.g., IFN-α, IL-2 and IL-12) tend to favor the induction of cell mediated immune responses to an administered antigen. In contrast, high levels of Th2-type cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-β) tend to favor the induction of humoral immune responses. Following application of a vaccine as provided herein, a patient will support an immune response that includes Th1- and Th2-type responses. Within a preferred embodiment, in which a response is predominantly Th1-type, the level of Th1-type cytokines will increase to a greater extent than the level of Th2-type cytokines. The levels of these cytokines may be readily assessed using standard assays. For a review of the families of cytokines, see Mosmann and Coffman, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7:145-173, 1989. </p><p num="p-0146"> Preferred adjuvants for use in eliciting a predominantly Th1-type response include, for example, a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A, preferably 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL), together with an aluminum salt. MPL adjuvants are available from Corixa Corporation (Hamilton, Mont.) (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,436,727; 4,877,611; 4,866,034 and 4,912,094). CpG-containing oligonucleotides (in which the CpG dinucleotide is unmethylated) also induce a predominantly Th1 response. Such oligonucleotides are well known and are described, for example, in WO 96/02555. Another preferred adjuvant is a saponin, preferably QS21, which may be used alone or in combination with other adjuvants. For example, an enhanced system involves the combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and saponin derivative, such as the combination of QS21 and 313MPL as described in WO 94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched with cholesterol, as described in WO 96/33739. Other preferred formulations comprises an oil-in-water emulsion and tocopherol. A particularly potent adjuvant formulation involving QS21, 3D-MPL and tocopherol in an oil-in-water emulsion is described in WO 95/17210. Another adjuvant that may be used is AS-2 (Smith-Kline Beecham). Any vaccine provided herein may be prepared using well known methods that result in a combination of antigen, immune response enhancer and a suitable carrier or excipient. </p><p num="p-0147"> A stress polypeptide of the invention can also be used as an adjuvant, eliciting a predominantly Th1-type response as well. The stress polypeptide can be used in conjunction with other vaccine components, including an immunogenic polypeptide and, optionally, additional adjuvants. </p><p num="p-0148"> The compositions described herein may be administered as part of a sustained release formulation (i.e., a formulation such as a capsule or sponge that effects a slow release of compound following administration). Such formulations may generally be prepared using well known technology and administered by, for example, oral, rectal or subcutaneous implantation, or by implantation at the desired target site. Sustained-release formulations may contain a polypeptide, polynucleotide or antibody dispersed in a carrier matrix and/or contained within a reservoir surrounded by a rate controlling membrane. Carriers for use within such formulations are biocompatible, and may also be biodegradable; preferably the formulation provides a relatively constant level of active component release. The amount of active compound contained within a sustained release formulation depends upon the site of implantation, the rate and expected duration of release and the nature of the condition to be treated or prevented. </p><p num="h-0013"> Antigen Presenting Cells </p><p num="p-0149"> Any of a variety of delivery vehicles may be employed within pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines to facilitate production of an antigen-specific immune response that targets tumor cells or infected cells. Delivery vehicles include antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, monocytes and other cells that may be engineered to be efficient APCs. Such cells may, but need not, be genetically modified to increase the capacity for presenting the antigen, to improve activation and/or maintenance of the T cell response, to have anti-tumor or anti-infective effects per se and/or to be immunologically compatible with the receiver (i.e., matched BLA haplotype). APCs may generally be isolated from any of a variety of biological fluids and organs, including tumor and peritumoral tissues, and may be autologous, allogeneic, syngeneic or xenogeneic cells. </p><p num="p-0150"> Certain preferred embodiments of the present invention use dendritic cells or progenitors thereof as antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells are highly potent APCs (Banchereau and Steinman, Nature 392:245-251, 1998) and have been shown to be effective as a physiological adjuvant for eliciting prophylactic or therapeutic antitumor immunity (see Timmerman and Levy, Ann. Rev. Med. 50:507-529, 1999). In general, dendritic cells may be identified based on their typical shape (stellate in situ, with marked cytoplasmic processes (dendrites) visible in vitro) and based on the lack of differentiation markers of B cells (CD19 and CD20), T cells (CD3), monocytes (CD14) and natural killer cells (CD56), as determined using standard assays. Dendritic cells may, of course, be engineered to express specific cell surface receptors or ligands that are not commonly found on dendritic cells in vivo or ex vivo, and such modified dendritic cells are contemplated by the present invention. As an alternative to dendritic cells, secreted vesicles antigen-loaded dendritic cells (called exosomes) may be used within a vaccine (see Zitvogel et al., Nature Med. 4:594-600, 1998). </p><p num="p-0151"> Dendritic cells and progenitors may be obtained from peripheral blood, bone marrow, tumor-infiltrating cells, peritumoral tissues-infiltrating cells, lymph nodes, spleen, skin, umbilical cord blood or any other suitable tissue or fluid. For example, dendritic cells may be differentiated ex vivo by adding a combination of cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-13 and/or TNFα to cultures of monocytes harvested from peripheral blood. Alternatively, CD34 positive cells harvested from peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood or bone marrow may be differentiated into dendritic cells by adding to the culture medium combinations of GM-CSF, IL-3, TNFα, CD40 ligand, LPS, flt3 ligand and/or other compound(s) that induce maturation and proliferation of dendritic cells. </p><p num="p-0152"> Dendritic cells are conveniently categorized as “immature” and “mature” cells, which allows a simple way to discriminate between two well characterized phenotypes. However, this nomenclature should not be construed to exclude all possible intermediate stages of differentiation. Immature dendritic cells are characterized as APC with a high capacity for antigen uptake and processing, which correlates with the high expression of Fcγ receptor, mannose receptor and DEC-205 marker. The mature phenotype is typically characterized by a lower expression of these markers, but a high expression of cell surface molecules responsible for T cell activation such as class I and class II NMC, adhesion molecules (e.g., CD54 and CD11) and costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80 and CD86). </p><p num="p-0153"> APCs may generally be transfected with a polynucleotide encoding a stress protein (or portion or other variant thereof) such that the stress polypeptide, or an immunogenic portion thereof, is expressed on the cell surface. Such transfection may take place ex vivo, and a composition or vaccine comprising such transfected cells may then be used for therapeutic purposes, as described herein. Alternatively, a gene delivery vehicle that targets a dendritic or other antigen presenting cell may be administered to a patient, resulting in transfection that occurs in vivo. In vivo and ex vivo transfection of dendritic cells, for example, may generally be performed using any methods known in the art, such as those described in WO 97/24447, or the gene gun approach described by Mahvi et al., Immunology and Cell Biology 75:456-460, 1997. Antigen loading of dendritic cells may be achieved by incubating dendritic cells or progenitor cells with the stress polypeptide, DNA (naked or within a plasmid vector) or RNA; or with antigen-expressing recombinant bacterium or viruses (e.g., vaccinia, fowlpox, adenovirus or lentivirus vectors). Prior to loading, the polypeptide may be covalently conjugated to an immunological partner that provides T cell help (e.g., a carrier molecule). Alternatively, a dendritic cell may be pulsed with a non-conjugated immunological partner, separately or in the presence of the polypeptide. </p><p num="h-0014"> Therapeutic and Prophylactic Methods </p><p num="p-0154"> The stress protein complexes and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered to a subject, thereby providing methods for inhibiting <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-infection, for inhibiting tumor growth, for inhibiting the development of a cancer, and for the treatment or prevention of cancer or infectious disease. </p><p num="p-0155"> Treatment includes prophylaxis and therapy. Prophylaxis or therapy can be accomplished by a single direct injection at a single time point or multiple time points to a single or multiple sites. Administration can also be nearly simultaneous to multiple sites. </p><p num="p-0156"> Patients or subjects include mammals, such as human, bovine, equine, canine, feline, porcine, and ovine animals. The subject is preferably a human, and may or may not be afflicted with cancer or disease. </p><p num="p-0157"> In some embodiments, the condition to be treated or prevented is cancer or a precancerous condition (e.g., hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia). Example of cancer include, but are not limited to, fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oliodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and heavy chain disease. </p><p num="p-0158"> In some embodiments, the condition to be treated or prevented is an infectious disease. Examples of infectious disease include, but are not limited to, infection with a pathogen, virus, bacterium, fungus or parasite. Examples of viruses include, but are not limited to, hepatitis type B or type C, influenza, varicella, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus type I or type II, rinderpest, rhinovirus, echovirus, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, papilloma virus, papova virus, cytomegalovirus, echinovirus, arbovirus, hantavirus, coxsachie virus, mumps virus, measles virus, rubella virus, polio virus, human immunodeficiency virus type I or type II. Examples of bacteria include, but are not limited to, <i>M. tuberculosis, </i>mycobacterium, mycoplasma, neisseria and legionella. Examples of parasites include, but are not limited to, rickettsia and chlamydia. </p><p num="p-0159"> Accordingly, the above pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines may be used to prevent the development of a cancer or infectious disease or to treat a patient afflicted with a cancer or infectious disease. A cancer may be diagnosed using criteria generally accepted in the art, including the presence of a malignant tumor. Pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines may be administered either prior to or following surgical removal of primary tumors and/or treatment such as administration of radiotherapy or conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. </p><p num="p-0160"> Within certain embodiments, immunotherapy may be active immunotherapy, in which treatment relies on the in vivo stimulation of the endogenous host immune system to react against tumors or infected cells with the administration of immune response-modifying agents (such as polypeptides and polynucleotides disclosed herein). </p><p num="p-0161"> Within other embodiments, immunotherapy may be passive immunotherapy, in which treatment involves the delivery of agents with established tumor-immune reactivity (such as effector cells or antibodies) that can directly or indirectly mediate antitumor effects and does not necessarily depend on an intact host immune system. Examples of effector cells include T cells as discussed above, T lymphocytes (such as CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4+ T-helper tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes), killer cells (such as Natural Killer cells and lymphokine-activated killer cells), B cells and antigen-presenting cells (such as dendritic cells and macrophages) expressing a polypeptide provided herein. In a preferred embodiment, dendritic cells are modified in vitro to present the polypeptide, and these modified APCs are administered to the subject. T cell receptors and antibody receptors specific for the polypeptides recited herein may be cloned, expressed and transferred into other vectors or effector cells for adoptive immunotherapy. The polypeptides provided herein may also be used to generate antibodies or anti-idiotypic antibodies (as described above and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,164) for passive immunotherapy. </p><p num="p-0162"> Effector cells may generally be obtained in sufficient quantities for adoptive immunotherapy by growth in vitro, as described herein. Culture conditions for expanding single antigen-specific effector cells to several billion in number with retention of antigen recognition in vivo are well known in the art. Such in vitro culture conditions typically use intermittent stimulation with antigen, often in the presence of cytokines (such as IL-2) and non-dividing feeder cells. As noted above, immunoreactive polypeptides as provided herein may be used to rapidly expand antigen-specific T cell cultures in order to generate a sufficient number of cells for immunotherapy. </p><p num="p-0163"> In particular, antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic, macrophage, monocyte, fibroblast and/or B cells, can be pulsed with immunoreactive polypeptides or transfected with one or more polynucleotides using standard techniques well known in the art. For example, antigen-presenting cells can be transfected with a polynucleotide having a promoter appropriate for increasing expression in a recombinant virus or other expression system. Cultured effector cells for use in therapy must be able to grow and distribute widely, and to survive long term in vivo. Cultured effector cells can be induced to grow in vivo and to survive long term in substantial numbers by repeated stimulation with antigen supplemented with IL-2 (see, for example, Cheever et al., Immunological Reviews 157:177, 1997). </p><p num="p-0164"> Alternatively, a vector expressing a polypeptide recited herein can be introduced into antigen presenting cells taken from a patient and clonally propagated ex vivo for transplant back into the same patient.

Suitable methods of administering cells in the context of the present invention to a subject are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular cell composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. </p><p num="p-0166"> The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention, should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time, or to inhibit infection or disease due to infection. Thus, the composition is administered to a subject in an amount sufficient to elicit an effective immune response to the specific antigens and/or to alleviate, reduce, cure or at least partially arrest symptoms and/or complications from the disease or infection. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a “therapeutically effective dose.”</p><p num="p-0167"> Routes and frequency of administration of the therapeutic compositions disclosed herein, as well as dosage, will vary from individual to individual, and may be readily established using standard techniques. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines may be administered, by injection (e.g., intracutaneous, intratumoral, intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous), intranasally (e.g., by aspiration) or orally. Preferably, between 1 and 10 doses may be administered over a 52 week period. Preferably, 6 doses are administered, at intervals of 1 month, and booster vaccinations may be given periodically thereafter. Alternate protocols may be appropriate for individual patients. In one embodiment, 2 intradermal injections of the composition are administered 10 days apart. </p><p num="p-0168"> A suitable dose is an amount of a compound that, when administered as described above, is capable of promoting an anti-tumor immune response, and is at least 10-50% above the basal (i.e., untreated) level. Such response can be monitored, for example, by measuring the anti-tumor antibodies in a patient or by vaccine-dependent generation of cytolytic effector cells capable of killing the patient's tumor cells in vitro. Such vaccines should also be capable of causing an immune response that leads to an improved clinical outcome (e.g., more frequent remissions, complete or partial or longer disease-free survival) in vaccinated patients as compared to nonvaccinated patients. In general, for pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines comprising one or more polypeptides, the amount of each polypeptide present in a dose ranges from about 100 μg to 5 mg per kg of host. Suitable volumes will vary with the size of the patient, but will typically range from about 0.1 mL to about 5 mL. </p><p num="p-0169"> In general, an appropriate dosage and treatment regimen provides the active compound(s) in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit. Such a response can be monitored by establishing an improved clinical outcome (e.g., more frequent remissions, complete or partial, or longer disease-free survival) in treated patients as compared to non-treated patients. Increases in preexisting immune responses to a tumor protein generally correlate with an improved clinical outcome. Such immune responses may generally be evaluated using standard proliferation, cytotoxicity or cytokine assays, which may be performed using samples obtained from a patient before and after treatment. </p><heading>EXAMPLES </heading><p num="p-0170"> The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention and to assist one of ordinary skill in making and using the same.

Seven days after the last immunization, mice were injected subcutaneously on the right flank with 2×10<sup>4 </sup>colon 26 tumor cells (viability&gt;99%). The colon 26 tumor exemplifies a murine tumor model that is highly resistant to therapy.

All mice that were immunized with PBS and liver derived hsp110 or grp170 developed rapidly growing tumors. In contrast, mice immunized with tumor derived hsp110 and grp170 showed a significant tumor growth delay. Thus, hsp110 or grp170 that is complexed with tumor proteins significantly inhibits tumor growth. </p><p num="p-0181"> The inhibition effect was directly dependent on the dose of tumor derived hsp110 or grp170. Mice immunized with 20 μg (per injection) of hsp110 or grp170 showed slight or no inhibition of colon 26 tumor growth, while those immunized with 40 or 60 μg of hsp110 or grp170 showed increasingly significant tumor growth delay. On each day examined (15, 21, 27 days after challenge), the mean volumes of the tumors that developed in mice immunized with hsp110 and grp170 at doses of 40 and 60 μg were significantly smaller than those of control mice (p&lt;0.01, student's t test). However, the differences in the mean volumes of the groups injected with PBS or liver derived hsp preparations did not reach statistical significance. Additional tumor rejection assays were performed by challenging mice with larger quantities of tumor cells (50,000 and 100,000). Similar inhibitory results were obtained for tumor derived hsp110 or grp170, although, as expected, these tumors grew more rapidly. Although grp170 was purified by conA-sepharose column, a contamination with conA can be ruled out because the protective immunity could only be observed in the mice immunized with grp170 preparations from tumor but not normal liver tissue. </p><p num="p-0182"> On an equal molar, quantitative basis, grp170 appears to be more immunogenic than hsp110.

The survival of mice was recorded as the percentage of mice surviving after the tumor challenge at various times. </p><p num="p-0186"> The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.

All the control animals died within 30 days, but approximately one-half of each group survived to 40 days, and 20% of grp170 treated mice survived to 60 days. These results are consistent with the data obtained from the tumor injection assay, and again indicate that grp170 and hsp110 are effective anti-cancer vaccines.

These results parallel the direct immunization studies with hsp110 or grp170. Comparison of direct immunization with protein (2 subcutaneous injections of 40 μg protein) versus immunization with pulsed DCs (10<sup>6 </sup>DCs pulsed with 20 μg protein) suggests that pulsed DC based immunotherapy is more efficient, as it was more effective and used less protein. </p><heading>Example 5 </heading><heading>Production of More Effective Vaccines Through Heat Treatment </heading><p num="p-0194"> This example demonstrates that stress proteins purified from heat-treated tumors are even more effective at reducing tumor size than stress proteins purified from non-heat-treated tumors. This increased efficacy may reflect improved peptide binding at higher temperatures as well as other heat-induced changes. </p><p num="p-0195"> Mice were first inoculated subcutaneously with 100,000 colon 26 tumor cells on the flank area. After the tumors reached a size of approximately 1/1 cm, WBH was carried out as described before. Briefly, mice were placed in microisolater cages preheated to 38° C. that contained food, bedding and water. The cages were then placed in a gravity convection oven (Memmert model BE500, East Troy, Wis.) with preheated incoming fresh air. The body temperature was gradually increased 1° C. every 30 minutes until a core temperature of 39.5° C. (±0.5 C) was achieved. Mice were kept in the oven for 6 hours. The core temperature of the mice was monitored with the Electric laboratory Animal Monitoring system Pocket Scanner (Maywood, N.J.). Tumors were removed on the next day for purification of hsp110, grp170 and hsp70. Immunizations were performed as above, twice at weekly intervals, using PBS, 40 μg hsp110 derived from tumors, 40 μg hsp110 derived from WBH-treated tumor, 40 μg grp170 derived from tumors, 40 μg grp170 derived from WBH-treated tumor, 40 μg hsp70 derived from tumors, or 40 μg hsp70 derived from WBH-treated tumor. Mice were then challenged with 20,000 live colon 26 tumor cells.

At 12 and 15 days after tumor challenge, both of the hsp110- and hsp70-treated groups showed significantly reduced tumor volume relative to PBS-treated mice. By 15 days following tumor challenge, hsp110 or hsp70 purified from WBH-treated tumor was significantly more effective at reducing tumor volume as compared to hsp110 or hsp70 purified from non-heat-treated tumor. However, by 15 days, grp170 purified from non-heat-treated tumor was more effective than grp170 from WBH-treated tumor. </p><p num="p-0197"> These data indicate that fever-like exposures can influence the antigen presentation pathway and/or peptide binding properties of these two (heat inducible) hsps purified from colon 26 tumors but not a heat insensitive grp. Thus, the vaccine potential of hsp70 and hsp110 are significantly enhanced following fever level therapy. This could result from enhanced proteosome activity, enhanced peptide binding of the hsp, altered spectrum of peptides bound to the hsp, or other factors. Because the hsps were purified 16 hours after the 8-hour hyperthermic exposure, the effect is maintained for some time at 37° C. The factors leading to this enhanced immunogenicity likely derive from an altered and/or enhanced antigenic profile of hsp bound peptides. Stability following the hyperthermic episode suggests up-stream changes in antigen processing that are still present many hours later, e.g. stimulation of proteosome activity. Another feature of fever-like hyperthermia is the highly significant induction of hsps in colon 26 tumors. Therefore, fever-like heating not only provides a more efficient vaccine in the case of the hsps examined, but also a lot more of it. Finally, it is intriguing that the observed increase in vaccine efficiency resulting from hyperthermia is seen only for hsp110 and hsc70. Grp170, which is regulated by an alternative set of stress conditions such as anoxia and other reducing states, but not heat, is diminished in its vaccine potential by heat. </p><p num="p-0198"> In addition to these observations, the data shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrate that grp170 purified from unheated, control tumors (mice) is significantly more efficient in its vaccine efficiency when compared on an equal mass basis to either hsp70 or hsp110 (without heat). This increased efficiency of grp170 compared to hsp110 is also reflected in the studies described above. This comparison is based on administration of equal masses of these proteins and the enhanced efficiency of grp170 is further exacerbated when molecular size is taken into account (i.e. comparisons made on a molar basis). Third, hsp70 is seen here to be approximately equivalent in its vaccine efficiency (again, on an equal mass but not equal molar basis) to hsp110. </p><heading>Example 6 </heading><heading>Chaperoning Activity of Grp170 and Hsp110 </heading><p num="p-0199"> This example demonstrates, through a protein aggregation assay, the ability of grp170 and hsp110 to chaperone protein and prevent aggregation. The results show the increased efficiency of grp170 and hsp110 as compared to that demonstrated for hsp70 (Oh et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:31636-31640). </p><p num="p-0200"> The ability of the stress proteins to prevent protein aggregation induced by heat treatment was assessed by the suppression of the increase in light scattering obtained upon heat treatment in the presence of a reporter protein, firefly luciferase. Luciferase was incubated with equimolar amounts of hsp110 or grp170 at 43° C. for 30 minutes. Aggregation was monitored by measuring the increase of optical density at 320 nm. The optical density of the luciferase heated alone was set to 100%. </p><p num="p-0201"> The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Hsp110 in a 1:1 molar ratio with luciferase limited aggregation to approximately 20% as compared to the 100% aggregation observed with luciferase alone. Grp170 in a 1:1 molar ratio with luciferase resulted in approximately 40% aggregation. These are the same conditions as used by Oh et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:31636-31640, which resulted in 70% aggregation with hsp70 in a 1:1 molar ratio with luciferase. Thus, both grp170 and hsp110 demonstrate a greater efficiency than hsp70 in binding protein and preventing aggregation. Based on studies in which the loop domain of hsp110 was deleted (Oh et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 272(22):15712-15718), this increased efficiency in chaperoning activity is likely attributable to the larger loop domain found in both hsp110 and grp170. </p><p num="p-0202"> Hsp110 and grp170 both appear to exhibit a peptide binding cleft. However, hsp110 and grp170 differ dramatically from the hsp70s in their C-terminal domains which, in the case of hsp70 proteins, appears to function as a lid for the peptide binding cleft and may have an important influence on the properties of the bound peptide/protein and/or the affinity for the associated peptide/protein. Both hsp110 and grp170 appear to be more significantly efficient in binding to and stabilizing thermally denatured proteins relative to hsc70. This may reflect these structural differences and influence peptide binding properties, a factor in the ability of stress proteins to function as vaccines. While hsp70 and hsp110 are approximately similar in vaccine efficiency, they may bind differing subsets of peptides, i.e. hsp110 may carry antigenic epitopes that do not readily bind to hsc70, i.e. they may exhibit differing vaccine potential if not differing (mass) efficiencies. A similar argument can be made for grp170. The significant differences in molar efficiencies of these stress proteins may result from differing peptide binding affinities, differing properties of peptides bound to each stress protein family, or differing affinities of antigen presenting cells to interact with each of these four stress protein groups. Also noteworthy is that grp170, the most efficient vaccine in this group, is the only glycoprotein of the group. </p><heading>Example 7 </heading><heading>Interaction of hsp110 with hsp25 and hsp70 </heading><p num="p-0203"> This example demonstrates the native interactions of hsp110, which protein was found to reside in a large molecular complex. Immunoblot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation studies identified two other heat shock proteins as components of this complex, hsp70 and hsp25. When examined in vitro, purified hsp25, hsp70 and hsp110 were observed to spontaneously form a large complex and to directly interact with one another. When luciferase was added to this in vitro system, it was observed to migrate into this chaperone complex following heat shock. Examination of two deletion mutants of hsp110 demonstrated that its peptide-binding domain is required for interaction with hsp25, but not with hsp70.

After cell extracts were applied to successive chromatography on Con-A sepharose and Mono Q columns, partially purified hsp110 fraction was loaded onto the Superose 6 size exclusion column (maximum resolution of 5,000 kDa). It was observed that the ConA and ion exchange purified hsp110 fraction eluted from the Superose column in those fractions of size range between 200 to 700 kDa (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). Work was repeated using sephacryl 300 (allyl dextran/bisacrylamide matrix) column and analysis provided similar data. </p><p num="p-0211"> Since hsp110 was eluted as one broad peak of high molecular mass, it is reasonable that this large in situ hsp110 complex might also contain additional components, potentially including other molecular chaperones and/or cellular substrates that may interact with hsp110. To investigate this possibility, the purified hsp110 fraction derived from both ion exchange and size exclusion columns was examined by immunoblotting for other HSPs using available antibodies. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, antibodies for hsp90, hsc70, T-complex polypeptide1 (TCP-1) and hsp25 were used. All four proteins were readily detectable in the total cell lysate (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). When the hsp110 fraction was examined, TCP-1 and hsp90 were not observed (lane 2 and 6). However, both hsc70 and hsp25 were found to co-purify with hsp110 with a significantly greater fraction of total cellular hsc70 present than of hsp25. Chromatography profile of hsc70 and hsp25 from size exclusion column also showed the similar pattern as that of hsp110 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). </p><p num="p-0212"> To determine whether this co-purification also reflected an interaction between these three molecular chaperones, a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis was conducted with Colon26 cell extracts and hsp110 fractions. Hsc70 and hsp25 were shown to precipitate with hsp110 using an anti-hsp110 antibody (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). Conversely, hsp110 was co-precipitated by an anti-hsc70 antibody or anti-hsp25 antibody (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10C</figref>, top). Pre-immune serum was also used to perform immunoprecipitation as a negative control with a correspondingly negative outcome. Finally, interaction between hsc70 and hsp25 was analyzed by using antibodies for hsc70 and hsp25. Again, these two proteins were observed to co-immunoprecipitate with one (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10C</figref>, bottom).

It has been shown that hsp110 can solubilize this reporter protein following heat denaturation. Luciferase, with hsp110, hsc70 and hsp25 mix (at 1:1 molar ratio) were incubated at room temperature or at 43° C. for 30 minutes. The soluble fractions were loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 column, eluted fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies for hsp110, hsc70, hsp25 and luciferase. </p><p num="p-0214"> The results of this study are presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. It was found that hsp110, hsc70 and hsp25 are again present in high molecule weight fractions, however these fractions were eluted at a significantly larger molecular size than that seen in vivo (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>). Moreover, it was seen that heat treatment does not change elution pattern for hsp110, hsc70 or hsp25. However, luciferase, which does not co-elute with the hsp110 complex prior to heating (being present as a monomer), was observed to move into high molecule weight structure after the heat exposure (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). Almost all of the luciferase was sustained in a soluble form in these experiments. When heated alone, luciferase became rapidly insoluble. Heat shock did not affect the solubility of the three hsp110, hsc70 or hsp25. </p><p num="p-0215"> The above data indicate that hsp110, hsc70, and hsp25 co-purify in a large molecular weight structure in vitro, as does luciferase (if present) after heating. This does not indicate how these proteins interact themselves or that any two of them interact at all. That heated luciferase remains soluble, however, is evidence for its interaction with at least one of the chaperones. To determine how these proteins interact, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed again using the pairs of purified proteins. Hsc70 and hsp110 were found to interact in the absence of hsp25 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, lane 1) and correspondingly hsp110 was observed to precipitate with hsp25 alone, in the absence of hsc70 (lane 4). Lastly, hsc70 and hsp25 also co-precipitate in the absence of hsp110 Vane 8). </p><p num="p-0216"> Finally, this in vitro study defining the interactions between hsp110, hsc70 and hsp25 was extended by examining two deletion mutants of hsp 110 that have previously been shown to represent the most simplistic (i.e. functional and non-functional) forms of this chaperone (Oh, H-J. et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15712-15718). The first mutant examined (#1) lacks the N-terminal ATP binding domain of hsp110, but contains the remaining sequence: i.e. the adjacent beta sheet peptide binding domain and other C-terminal sequences (size: 75 kDa and containing amino acids 375-858). This mutant has been shown to be fully functional in its ability to stabilize heat denatured luciferase in a folding competent state. The second mutant used here (#2), again lacked the ATP binding domain as well as the adjacent beta sheet (peptide binding) domain, but contained the remaining C terminal sequence (size: 62 kDa and containing amino acids 508-858). This mutant has recently been shown to be incapable of performing the chaperoning function of sustaining heat denatured luciferase in a soluble state. </p><p num="p-0217"> Mutant #1 (no ATP binding domain) was observed to co-precipitate with both hsp70 (lane 2) and hsp25 (lane 5), indicating that these interactions do not involve its ATP binding domain. However, mutant #2 (lacking both the ATP region and the peptide-binding region of hsp110 ) was observed to only associate with hsp70 (lane 3). This indicates that hsp25 and hsp70 can interact with hsp110 at different sites and that the association of hsp110 with hsp25 requires the peptide-binding domain of hsp110. </p><p num="h-0050"> Discussion </p><p num="p-0218"> This example describes investigations into the native interactions of hsp110 in Colon26 cells. The results show that hsp110 co-purifies with both hsc70 and hsp25 and further, that the three proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated. To determine that the co-immunoprecipitation results can reflect direct interactions between these chaperones and to also define these interactions, in vitro studies using purified hsp110, hsc70 and hsp25 were undertaken. It was found that these three chaperones also spontaneously form a large molecular complex in vitro. Moreover, this complex forms in the absence of an added substrate, but substrate (luciferase) can be induced to migrate into the complex by a heat stress. </p><p num="p-0219"> It is also shown that each pair of these proteins can interact directly, i.e. hsc70 with hsp110, hsc70 with hsp25, and hsp110 with hsp25. This, together with the co-precipitation data obtained from cell lysates, strongly argues that these interactions naturally occur in situ. Moreover, use of two deletion mutants of hsp110 demonstrate that its peptide-binding domain is required for hsp25 binding, but not for hsc70 binding, and that its ATP binding domain is not required for the interaction with either hsc70 or hsp25. This suggests that hsp110 binds to hsp25 through its peptide-binding domain. That hsc70-hsp110 binding occurs in the absence of the hsp110 peptide-binding domain suggests that hsc70 may be actively binding to hsp110 through its (i.e. hsc70's) peptide-binding domain, but does not exclude the possibility that the two proteins interact via the involvement of other C-terminal domains. </p><p num="p-0220"> These interactions between hsp110 and hsc70 raise possibilities as to how these proteins may function cooperatively. Since the peptide-binding domain of hsc70 and hsp110 appears to represent the “business end” of these chaperones in performing chaperoning functions, one might expect that their peptide binding domains would be actively associated with substrate and not one another. This raises the possibility that this complex represents a chaperone “storage compartment” that awaits cellular requirements. However, the migration of heat denatured luciferase into this fraction following heat shock argues for an active chaperoning activity of the complex itself. It is possible that hsc70 may piggy-back hsp110 in a manner that allows transfer of substrate from hsp110 to hsc70 with subsequent folding in conjunction with DnaJ homologs and other chaperones. </p><p num="p-0221"> Hsp110 has not yet been shown to have a folding function in conjunction with DnaJ co-chaperones, as is the case with hsc70 (Oh, H. J. et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272, 31696-31640; Oh, H. J. et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15712-15718). However, hsp110 exhibits different ATP binding properties than do the hsp70s, and possible co-chaperones of hsp110 may be awaiting discovery. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that while sHSPs (e.g. hsp25) bind nonnative protein, refolding still requires the presence of hsp70 (Lee, G. J. et al., 1997, EMBO J. 16, 659-671;Jakob, U. et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7414-7421; Merck, K. B. et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268, 1046-1052; Kampinga, H. H et al., 1994, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 204, 170-1177; Ehrnsperger, M. et al., 1997, EMBO J. 16, 221-229). Hsp110 and sHSPs may act in the differential binding of a broad variety of substrates for subsequent shuttling to hsp70-DnaJ containing chaperone machines. </p><p num="p-0222"> That these three chaperones interact may represent a general phenomenon. Plesofsky-Vig and Brambl have recently shown that the small HSP of <i>Neurospora crassa, </i>called hsp30, binds to two cellular proteins, hsp70 and hsp88. Cloning and analysis of hsp88 has shown that it represents the hsp110 of <i>Neurospora crassa </i>(Plesofsky-Vig, N. and Brambl, R., 1998, J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11335-11341), suggesting that the interactions described here are phylogenetically conserved. In addition, Hatayama has described an interaction between hsp110 (referred to as hsp105) and hsp70 in FM3A cells (Hatayama, T et al., 1998, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 248, 394-401). The size of the hsp110 complex and the interaction with hsc70 observed in the present example (which also employed the added step of ion exchange chromatography) are clearly similar to, and in excellent agreement with this recent report. Finally, hsp90 and TCP-1 were not observed in the hsp110 complex in the present study, despite its previously identified association with hsc70 and other proteins in the steroid hormone receptor. However, it has recently been shown that SSE1 encoding a yeast member of the hsp110 family is required for the function of glucocorticoid receptor and physically associates with the hsp90 (Liu, X. D. et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274, 26654-26660). </p><p num="p-0223"> The data presented in this example suggest that this complex offers an enhanced capacity to hold a greater variety of substrate proteins in a folding competent state and/or to do so more efficiently. The results further suggest that there may be an enhanced ability gained to refold denatured proteins in the presence of additional chaperones. </p><heading>Example 8 </heading><heading>In Vitro Formation and Stability of Stress Polypeptide Complexes </heading><p num="p-0224"> This example demonstrates that complexes of stress polypeptides with immunogenic polypeptides can be generated in vitro and that such complexes remain stable following freezing and thawing.
