The contents of the prior applications are hereby incorporated in their entirety.</p><p num="p0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0005">The p53 gene is mutated in over 50 different types of human cancers, including familial and spontaneous cancers, and is believed to be the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer (Zambetti and Levine, FASEB (1993) 7:855-865; Hollstein, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. (1994) 22:3551-3555). Greater than 90% of mutations in the p53 gene are missense mutations that alter a single amino acid that inactivates p53 function. Aberrant forms of human p53 are associated with poor prognosis, more aggressive tumors, metastasis, and short survival rates (Mitsudomi et al., Clin Cancer Res 2000 Oct; 6(10):4055-63; Koshland, Science (1993) 262:1953).</p><p num="p0006">The human p53 protein normally functions as a central integrator of signals including DNA damage, hypoxia, nucleotide deprivation, and oncogene activation (Prives, Cell (1998) 95:5-8). In response to these signals, p53 protein levels are greatly increased with the result that the accumulated p53 activates cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the nature and strength of these signals. Indeed, multiple lines of experimental evidence have pointed to a key role for p53 as a tumor suppressor (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331). For example, homozygous p53 "knockout" mice are developmentally normal but exhibit nearly 100% incidence of neoplasia in the first year of life (Donehower et al., Nature (1992) 356:215-221).</p><p num="p0007">The biochemical mechanisms and pathways through which p53 functions in normal and cancerous cells are not fully understood, but one clearly important aspect of p53 function is its activity as a gene-specific transcriptional activator. Among the genes with known p53-response elements are several with well-characterized roles in either regulation of the cell cycle or apoptosis, including GADD45, ρ21/Wafl/Ciρl, cyclin G, Bax, IGFBPS, andMDM2 (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331).</p><p num="p0008">Members of the TBC1D (tre-2/USP6, BUB2, cdclό) family of proteins contain TBC domains, which may activate Rab-like small GTPases. Members of this group may have regions of low homolgy to a region of human RAB6 GTPase activating protein, which

functions in microtubule nucleation. Members of this group may also have similarity to nuclear proteins involved in the cell cycle and differentiation of certain tissues. This protein family is thought to have a role in differentiation and in regulating cell growth (White RA et al. (2000) Cytogenet Cell Genet 89:272-5). An alteration of TBCIDI sequence may be associated with a pathological condition, resulting in abnormal cell proliferation, leading to cancer, for example, prostate cancer (Published PCT application WO200008209).</p><p num="p0009">The ability to manipulate the genomes of model organisms such as Drosophila provides a powerful means to analyze biochemical processes that, due to significant evolutionary conservation, have direct relevance to more complex vertebrate organisms. Due to a high level of gene and pathway conservation, the strong similarity of cellular processes, and the functional conservation of genes between these model organisms and mammals, identification of the involvement of novel genes in particular pathways and their functions in such model organisms can directly contribute to the understanding of the correlative pathways and methods of modulating them in mammals (see, for example,</p><p num="p0010">Mechler BM et al., 1985 EMBO J 4:1551-1557; Gateff E. 1982 Adv. Cancer Res. 37: 33- 74; Watson KL., et al., 1994 J Cell Sci. 18: 19-33; Miklos GL, and Rubin GM. 1996 Cell 86:521-529; Wassarman DA, et al., 1995 Curr Opin Gen Dev 5: 44-50; and Booth DR. 1999 Cancer Metastasis Rev. 18: 261-284). For example, a genetic screen can be carried out in an invertebrate model organism having underexpression (e.g. knockout) or overexpression of a gene (referred to as a "genetic entry point") that yields a visible phenotype. Additional genes are mutated in a random or targeted manner. When a gene mutation changes the original phenotype caused by the mutation in the genetic entry point, the gene is identified as a "modifier" involved in the same or overlapping pathway as the genetic entry point. When the genetic entry point is an ortholog of a human gene implicated in a disease pathway, such as p53, modifier genes can be identified that may be attractive candidate targets for novel therapeutics.</p><p num="p0011">All references cited herein, including sequence information in referenced Genbank identifier numbers and website references, are incorporated herein in their entireties.</p><p num="p0012">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0013">We have discovered genes that modify the p53 pathway in Drosophila, and identified their human orthologs, hereinafter referred to as TBCIDI. The invention provides methods for utilizing these p53 modifier genes and polypeptides to identify candidate

therapeutic agents that can be used in the treatment of disorders associated with defective p53 function. Preferred TBClDl-moduIating agents specifically bind to TBCIDI polypeptides and restore p53 function. Other preferred TBClDl-modulating agents are nucleic acid modulators such as antisense oligomers and RNAi that repress TBCIDI gene expression or product activity by, for example, binding to and inhibiting the respective nucleic acid (i.e. DNA or mRNA).</p><p num="p0014">TBClDl-specific modulating agents may be evaluated by any convenient in vitro or in vivo assay for molecular interaction with a TBCIDI polypeptide or nucleic acid. In one embodiment, candidate p53 modulating agents are tested with an assay system comprising a TBCIDI polypeptide or nucleic acid. Candidate agents that produce a change in the activity of the assay system relative to controls are identified as candidate p53 modulating agents. The assay system may be cell-based or cell-free. TBClDl-modulating agents include TBCIDI related proteins (e.g. dominant negative mutants, and biotherapeutics); TBCIDI -specific antibodies; TBCIDI -specific antisense oligomers and other nucleic acid modulators; and chemical agents that specifically bind TBCIDI or compete with TBCIDI binding target. In one specific embodiment, a small molecule modulator is identified using a binding assay. In specific embodiments, the screening assay system is selected from an apoptosis assay, a cell proliferation assay, an angiogenesis assay, and a hypoxic induction assay. In another embodiment, candidate p53 pathway modulating agents are further tested using a second assay system that detects changes in the p53 pathway, such as angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation changes produced by the originally identified candidate agent or an agent derived from the original agent. The second assay system may use cultured cells or non-human animals. In specific embodiments, the secondary assay system uses non-human animals, including animals predetermined to have a disease or disorder implicating the p53 pathway, such as an angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation disorder (e.g. cancer).</p><p num="p0015">The invention further provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway in a mammalian cell by contacting the mammalian cell with an agent that specifically binds a TBCIDI polypeptide or nucleic acid. The agent may be a small molecule modulator, a nucleic acid modulator, or an antibody and may be administered to a mammalian animal predetermined to have a pathology associated the p53 pathway.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0016">Genetic screens were designed to identify modifiers of the p53 pathway in Drosophila in which p53 was overexpressed in the wing (Ollmann M, et al., Cell 2000 101: 91-101). The plx gene was identified as a modifier of the p53 pathway. Accordingly, vertebrate orthologs of these modifiers, and preferably the human orthologs, TBCIDI genes (i.e., nucleic acids and polypeptides) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of pathologies associated with a defective p53 signaling pathway, such as cancer.</p><p num="p0017">In vitro and in vivo methods of assessing TBCIDI function are provided herein. Modulation of the TBCIDI or their respective binding partners is useful for understanding the association of the p53 pathway and its members in normal and disease conditions and for developing diagnostics and therapeutic modalities for p53 related pathologies. TBClDl-modulating agents that act by inhibiting or enhancing TBCIDI expression, directly or indirectly, for example, by affecting a TBCIDI function such as binding activity, can be identified using methods provided herein. TBCIDI modulating agents are useful in diagnosis, therapy and pharmaceutical development.</p><p num="p0018">Nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention</p><p num="p0019">Sequences related to TBCIDI nucleic acids and polypeptides that can be used in the invention are disclosed in Genbank (referenced by Genbank identifier (Gl) number) as GI#s 13649264 (SEQ ID NO:l), 7662197 (SEQ ID NO:2), 14757710 (SEQ ID NO:3), 12737920 (SEQ ID NO:4), 5689552 (SEQ ID NO:5), 18558614 (SEQ ID NO:6), and 17939551 (SEQ ID NO:7) for nucleic acid, and GI#s 12737921 (SEQ ID NO:10), 7662198 (SEQ ID NO: 11), 14757711 (SEQ ID NO: 12), and 5689553 (SEQ ID NO: 13) for polypeptides. Other sequences that can be used in the invention are TBCIDI 2<sup>nd</sup> transcript (nucleic acid, SEQ ID NO:8), TBCIDI 1<sup>st</sup> transcript (nucleic acid, SEQ ID NO:9), and huTBClDl (polypeptide, SEQ ID NO: 14), all from published application WO200008209.</p><p num="p0020">TBClDls are proteins with TBC domains. The term "TBCIDI polypeptide" refers to a full-length TBCIDI protein or a functionally active fragment or derivative thereof. A "functionally active" TBCIDI fragment or derivative exhibits one or more functional activities associated with a full-length, wild-type TBCIDI protein, such as antigenic or immunogenic activity, ability to bind natural cellular substrates, etc. The functional activity of TBCIDI proteins, derivatives and fragments can be assayed by various methods known to one skilled in the art (Current Protocols in Protein Science (1998) 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
Coligan et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Somerset, New Jersey) and as further discussed below. For purposes herein, functionally active fragments also include those fragments that comprise one or more structural domains of a TBCIDI, such as binding domain. Protein domains can be identified using the PFAM program (Bateman A., et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1999, 27:260-2; http://pfam.wustl.edu). For example, the TBC domains of TBCIDI from GI# 7662198 (SEQ ID NO: 11) and GI# 5689553 (SEQ ID NO: 13) are located respectively at approximately amino acid residues 863 to 1082 and 392 to 611 (PFAM 00566). Methods for obtaining TBCIDI polypeptides are also further described below. In some embodiments, preferred fragments are functionally active, domain-containing fragments comprising at least 25 contiguous amino acids, preferably at least 50, more preferably 75, and most preferably at least 100 contiguous amino acids of any one of SEQ ID NOs:10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 (a TBCIDI). In further preferred embodiments, the fragment comprises the entire TBC (functionally active) domain. The term "TBCIDI nucleic acid" refers to a DNA or RNA molecule that encodes a TBCIDI polypeptide. Preferably, the TBCIDI polypeptide or nucleic acid or fragment thereof is from a human, but can also be an ortholog, or derivative thereof with at least 70% sequence identity, preferably at least 80%, more preferably 85%, still more preferably 90%, and most preferably at least 95% sequence identity with TBCIDI. Normally, orthologs in different species retain the same function, due to presence of one or more protein motifs and/or 3 -dimensional structures. Orthologs are generally identified by sequence homology analysis, such as BLAST analysis, usually using protein bait sequences. Sequences are assigned as a potential ortholog if the best hit sequence from the forward BLAST result retrieves the original query sequence in the reverse BLAST (Huynen MA and Bork P, Proc Natl Acad Sci (1998) 95:5849-5856; Huynen MA et al, Genome Research (2000) 10: 1204-1210). Programs for multiple sequence alignment, such as CLUSTAL (Thompson JD et al, 1994, Nucleic Acids Res 22:4673-4680) may be used to highlight conserved regions and/or residues of orthologous proteins and to generate phylogenetic trees. In a phylogenetic tree representing multiple homologous sequences from diverse species (e.g., retrieved through BLAST analysis), orthologous sequences from two species generally appear closest on the tree with respect to all other sequences from these two species. Structural threading or other analysis of protein folding (e.g., using software by ProCeryon, Biosciences, Salzburg, Austria) may also identify potential orthologs. In evolution, when a gene duplication event follows speciation, a single gene in one species, such as Drosophila, may correspond to multiple genes (paralogs) in another, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
such as human. As used herein, the term "orthologs" encompasses paralogs. As used herein, "percent (%) sequence identity" with respect to a subject sequence, or a specified portion of a subject sequence, is defined as the percentage of nucleotides or amino acids in the candidate derivative sequence identical with the nucleotides or amino acids in the subject sequence (or specified portion thereof), after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, as generated by the program WU-BLAST-2.0al9 (Altschul et al, J. Mol. Biol. (1997) 215:403-410; http.V/blast. wustl.edu/blast/README.html) with all the search parameters set to default values. The HSP S and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched. A % identity value is determined by the number of matching identical nucleotides or amino acids divided by the sequence length for which the percent identity is being reported. "Percent (%) amino acid sequence similarity" is determined by doing the same calculation as for determining % amino acid sequence identity, but including conservative amino acid substitutions in addition to identical amino acids in the computation.</p><p num="p0021">A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid having similar properties such that the folding or activity of the protein is not significantly affected. Aromatic amino acids that can be substituted for each other are phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine; interchangeable hydrophobic amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine; interchangeable polar amino acids are glutamine and asparagine; interchangeable basic amino acids are arginine, lysine and histidine; interchangeable acidic amino acids are aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and interchangeable small amino acids are alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine and glycine. Alternatively, an alignment for nucleic acid sequences is provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2:482-489; database: European Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/MPsrch/; Smith and Waterman, 1981, J. of Molec.Biol., 147:195- 197; Nicholas et al., 1998, "A Tutorial on Searching Sequence Databases and Sequence Scoring Methods" (www.psc.edu) and references cited therein.; W.R. Pearson, 1991, Genomics 11:635-650). This algorithm can be applied to amino acid sequences by using the scoring matrix developed by Dayhoff (Dayhoff : Atlas of Protein Sequences and Structure, M. O. Dayhoff ed., 5 suppl. 3:353-358, National Biomedical Research

Foundation, Washington, D.C., USA), and normalized by Gribskov (Gribskov 1986 Nucl. Acids Res. 14(6):6745-6763). The Smith-Waterman algorithm may be employed where default parameters are used for scoring (for example, gap open penalty of 12, gap extension penalty of two). From the data generated, the "Match" value reflects "sequence identity."</p><p num="p0022">Derivative nucleic acid molecules of the subject nucleic acid molecules include sequences that hybridize to the nucleic acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs:l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. The stringency of hybridization can be controlled by temperature, ionic strength, pH, and the presence of denaturing agents such as formamide during hybridization and washing. Conditions routinely used are set out in readily available procedure texts (e.g., Current Protocol in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, Chap. 2.10, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Publishers (1994); Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor (1989)).

Production, Expression, and Mis-expression of TBCIDI Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides</p><p num="p0026">TBCIDI nucleic acids and polypeptides, useful for identifying and testing agents that modulate TBCIDI function and for other applications related to the involvement of TBCIDI in the p53 pathway. TBCIDI nucleic acids and derivatives and orthologs thereof may be obtained using any available method. For instance, techniques for isolating cDNA or genomic DNA sequences of interest by screening DNA libraries or by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are well known in the art. In general, the particular use for the protein will dictate the particulars of expression, production, and purification methods. For instance, production of proteins for use in screening for modulating agents may require methods that preserve specific biological activities of these proteins, whereas production of proteins for antibody generation may require structural integrity of particular epitopes. Expression of proteins to be purified for screening or antibody production may require the addition of specific tags (e.g., generation of fusion proteins). Overexpression of a TBCIDI protein for assays used to assess TBCIDI function, such as involvement in cell cycle regulation or hypoxic response, may require expression in eukaryotic cell lines capable of these cellular activities. Techniques for the expression, production, and purification of proteins are well known in the art; any suitable means therefore may be used (e.g., Higgins SJ and Hames BD (eds.) Protein Expression: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press Inc., New York 1999; Stanbury PF et al., Principles of Fermentation Technology, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, Elsevier Science, New York, 1995; Doonan S (ed.) Protein Purification Protocols, Humana Press, New Jersey, 1996; Coligan JE et al, Current Protocols in Protein Science (eds.), 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). In particular embodiments, recombinant TBCIDI is expressed in a cell line known to have defective p53 function (e.g. SAOS-2 osteoblasts, H1299 lung cancer cells, C33A and HT3 cervical cancer cells, HT-29 and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, among others, available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). The recombinant cells are used in cell-based screening assay systems of the invention, as described further below.</p><p num="p0027">The nucleotide sequence encoding a TBCIDI polypeptide can be inserted into any appropriate expression vector. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals,

including promoter/enhancer element, can derive from the native TBCIDI gene and/or its flanking regions or can be heterologous. A variety of host-vector expression systems may be utilized, such, as mammalian cell systems infected with virus (e.g. vaccinia virus, adenovirus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with virus (e.g. baculovirus); microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors, or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA. A host cell strain that modulates the expression of, modifies, and/or specifically processes the gene product may be used.</p><p num="p0028">To detect expression of the TBCIDI gene product, the expression vector can comprise a promoter operably linked to a TBCIDI gene nucleic acid, one or more origins of replication, and, one or more selectable markers (e.g. thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, etc.). Alternatively, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying for the expression of the TBCIDI gene product based on the physical or functional properties of the TBCIDI protein in in vitro assay systems (e.g. immunoassays). The TBCIDI protein, fragment, or derivative may be optionally expressed as a fusion, or chimeric protein product (i.e. it is joined via a peptide bond to a heterologous protein sequence of a different protein), for example to facilitate purification or detection. A chimeric product can be made by ligating the appropriate nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired amino acid sequences to each other using standard methods and expressing the chimeric product. A chimeric product may also be made by protein synthetic techniques, e.g. by use of a peptide synthesizer (Hunkapiller et al., Nature (1984) 310:105-111).</p><p num="p0029">Once a recombinant cell that expresses the TBCIDI gene sequence is identified, the gene product can be isolated and purified using standard methods (e.g. ion exchange, affinity, and gel exclusion chromatography; centrifugation; differential solubility; electrophoresis, cite purification reference). Alternatively, native TBCIDI proteins can be purified from natural sources, by standard methods (e.g. immunoaffinity purification). Once a protein is obtained, it may be quantified and its activity measured by appropriate methods, such as immunoassay, bioassay, or other measurements of physical properties, such as crystallography. The methods of this invention may also use cells that have been engineered for altered expression (mis-expression) of TBCIDI or other genes associated with the p53 pathway. As used herein, mis-expression encompasses ectopic expression, over-expression, under- expression, and non-expression (e.g. by gene knock-out or blocking expression that would otherwise normally occur).

Genetically modified animals</p><p num="p0030">Animal models that have been genetically modified to alter TBCIDI expression may be used in in vivo assays to test for activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent, or to further assess the role of TBCIDI in a p53 pathway process such as apoptosis or cell proliferation. Preferably, the altered TBCIDI expression results in a detectable phenotype, such as decreased or increased levels of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, or apoptosis compared to control animals having normal TBCIDI expression. The genetically modified animal may additionally have altered p53 expression (e.g. p53 knockout). Preferred genetically modified animals are mammals such as primates, rodents (preferably mice), cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs and cats. Preferred non- mammalian species include zebrafish, C. elegans, and Drosophila. Preferred genetically modified animals are transgenic animals having a heterologous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element in a portion of its cells, i.e. mosaic animals (see, for example, techniques described by Jakobovits, 1994, Curr. Biol. 4:761-763.) or stably integrated into its germ line DNA (i.e., in the genomic sequence of most or all of its cells). Heterologous nucleic acid is introduced into the germ line of such transgenic animals by genetic manipulation of, for example, embryos or embryonic stem cells of the host animal.</p><p num="p0031">Methods of making transgenic animals are well-known in the art (for transgenic mice see Brinster et al., Proc.

WO 97/07668 and WO 97/07669).</p><p num="p0032">In one embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-out" animal having a heterozygous or homozygous alteration in the sequence of an endogenous TBCIDI gene that results in a decrease of TBCIDI function, preferably such that TBCIDI expression is undetectable or insignificant. Knock-out animals are typically generated by homologous recombination with a vector comprising a transgene having at least a portion of the gene to be knocked out. Typically a deletion, addition or substitution has been introduced into the transgene to functionally disrupt it. The transgene can be a human gene (e.g., from a human genomic clone) but more preferably is an ortholog of the human gene derived from the transgenic host species. For example, a mouse TBCIDI gene is used to construct a homologous recombination vector suitable for altering an endogenous TBCIDI gene in the mouse genome. Detailed methodologies for homologous recombination in mice are available (see Capecchi, Science (1989) 244:1288-1292; Joyner et al, Nature (1989) 338: 153-156). Procedures for the production of non-rodent transgenic mammals and other animals are also available (Houdebine and Chourrout, supra; Pursel et al, Science (1989) 244:1281-1288; Simnis et al, Bio/Technology (1988) 6:179-183). In a preferred embodiment, knock-out animals, such as mice harboring a knockout of a specific gene, may be used to produce antibodies against the human counterpart of the gene that has been knocked out (Claesson MH et al., (1994) Scan J Immunol 40:257-264; Declerck PJ et al., (1995) J Biol Chem. 270:8397-400).</p><p num="p0033">In another embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-in" animal having an alteration in its genome that results in altered expression (e.g., increased (including ectopic) or decreased expression) of the TBCIDI gene, e.g., by introduction of additional copies of TBCIDI, or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for altered expression of an endogenous copy of the TBCIDI gene. Such regulatory sequences include inducible, tissue-specific, and constitutive promoters and enhancer elements. The knock-in can be homozygous or heterozygous.</p><p num="p0034">Transgenic nonhuman animals can also be produced that contain selected systems allowing for regulated expression of the transgene. One example of such a system that may be produced is the cre/loxP recombinase system of bacteriophage PI (Lakso et al, PNAS (1992) 89:6232-6236; U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,317). If a cre/loxP recombinase system is used to regulate expression of the transgene, animals containing transgenes encoding both the Cre recombinase and a selected protein are required. Such animals can be 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
provided through the construction of "double" transgenic animals, e.g., by mating two transgenic animals, one containing a transgene encoding a selected protein and the other containing a transgene encoding a recombinase. Another example of a recombinase system is the FLP recombinase system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (O'Gorman et al. (1991) Science 251:1351-1355; U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,182). In a preferred embodiment, both Cre-LoxP and Flp-Frt are used in the same system to regulate expression of the transgene, and for sequential deletion of vector sequences in the same cell (Sun X et al (2000) Nat Genet 25:83-6).</p><p num="p0035">The genetically modified animals can be used in genetic studies to further elucidate the p53 pathway, as animal models of disease and disorders implicating defective p53 function, and for in vivo testing of candidate therapeutic agents, such as those identified in screens described below. The candidate therapeutic agents are administered to a genetically modified animal having altered TBCIDI function and phenotypic changes are compared with appropriate control animals such as genetically modified animals that receive placebo treatment, and/or animals with unaltered TBCIDI expression that receive candidate therapeutic agent.</p><p num="p0036">In addition to the above-described genetically modified animals having altered TBCIDI function, animal models having defective p53 function (and otherwise normal TBCIDI function), can be used in the methods of the present invention. For example, a p53 knockout mouse can be used to assess, in vivo, the activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent identified in one of the in vitro assays described below. p53 knockout mice are described in the literature (Jacks et al., Nature 2001;410:1111-1116, 1043-1044; Donehower et al, supra).

Immunol. 20:483-89; Sutcliffe et al., (1983) Science 219:660-66) to the amino acid sequence shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs:10, 11, 12 13, or 14. Monoclonal antibodies with affinities of 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>"1</sup> preferably 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>"1</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, or stronger can be made by standard procedures as described (Harlow and Lane, supra; Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice (2d ed) Academic Press, New York; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,381,292; 4,451,570; and 4,618,577). Antibodies may be generated against crude cell extracts of TBCIDI or substantially purified fragments thereof. If TBCIDI fragments are used, they preferably

comprise at least 10, and more preferably, at least 20 contiguous amino acids of a TBCIDI protein. In a particular embodiment, TBCIDI -specific antigens and/or immunogens are coupled to carrier proteins that stimulate the immune response. For example, the subject polypeptides are covalently coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier, and the conjugate is emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, which enhances the immune response. An appropriate immune system such as a laboratory rabbit or mouse is immunized according to conventional protocols.</p><p num="p0051">The presence of TBClDl-specific antibodies is assayed by an appropriate assay such as a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using immobilized corresponding TBCIDI polypeptides. Other assays, such as radioimmunoassays or fluorescent assays might also be used.</p><p num="p0052">Chimeric antibodies specific to TBCIDI polypeptides can be made that contain different portions from different animal species. For instance, a human immunoglobulin constant region may be linked to a variable region of a murine rnAb, such that the antibody derives its biological activity from the human antibody, and its binding specificity from the murine fragment. Chimeric antibodies are produced by splicing together genes that encode the appropriate regions from each species (Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1984) 81:6851-6855; Neuberger et al., Nature (1984) 312:604-608; Takeda et al., Nature (1985) 31:452-454). Humanized antibodies, which are a form of chimeric antibodies, can be generated by grafting complementary-determining regions (CDRs) (Carlos, T. M., J. M. Harlan. 1994. Blood 84:2068-2101) of mouse antibodies into a background of human framework regions and constant regions by recombinant DNA technology (Riechmann LM, et al., 1988 Nature 323: 323-327). Humanized antibodies contain ~10% murine sequences and ~90% human sequences, and thus further reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, while retaining the antibody specificities (Co MS, and Queen C. 1991 Nature 351: 501-501; Morrison SL. 1992 Ann. Rev. Immun. 10:239-265). Humanized antibodies and methods of their production are well-known in the art (U.S. Pat.

 Other suitable techniques for antibody production involve in vitro exposure of lymphocytes to the antigenic polypeptides or alternatively to selection of libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors (Huse et al., Science (1989) 246:1275-1281). As used herein, T-cell antigen receptors are included within the scope of antibody modulators (Harlow and Lane, 1988, supra).</p><p num="p0054">The polypeptides and antibodies of the present invention may be used with or without modification. Frequently, antibodies will be labeled by joining, either covalently or non- covalently, a substance that provides for a detectable signal, or that is toxic to cells that express the targeted protein (Menard S, et al., Int J. Biol Markers (1989) 4:131-134). A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, fluorescent emitting lanthanide metals, chemiluminescent moieties, bioluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; and 4,366,241). Also, recombinant immunoglobulins may be produced (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). Antibodies to cytoplasmic polypeptides may be delivered and reach their targets by conjugation with membrane-penetrating toxin proteins (U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,900).</p><p num="p0055">When used therapeutically in a patient, the antibodies of the subject invention are typically administered parenterally, when possible at the target site, or intravenously. The therapeutically effective dose and dosage regimen is determined by clinical studies. Typically, the amount of antibody administered is in the range of about 0.1 mg/kg -to about 10 mg/kg of patient weight. For parenteral administration, the antibodies are formulated in a unit dosage injectable form (e.g., solution, suspension, emulsion) in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Such vehicles are inherently nontoxic and non-therapeutic. Examples are water, saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin. Nonaqueous vehicles such as fixed oils, ethyl oleate, or liposome carriers may also be used. The vehicle may contain minor amounts of additives, such as buffers and preservatives, which enhance isotonicity and chemical stability or otherwise enhance therapeutic potential. The antibodies' concentrations in such vehicles are typically in the range of about 1 mg/ml to aboutlO mg/ml. Immunotherapeutic methods are further described in the literature (US Pat. No. 5,859,206; WO0073469).

 Nucleic Acid Modulators</p><p num="p0056">Other preferred TBClDl-modulating agents comprise nucleic acid molecules, such as antisense oligomers or double stranded RNA (dsRNA), which generally inhibit TBCIDI activity. Preferred nucleic acid modulators interfere with the function of the TBCIDI nucleic acid such as DNA replication, transcription, translocation of the TBCIDI RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the TBCIDI RNA, splicing of the TBCIDI RNA to yield one or more mRNA species, or catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the TBCIDI RNA.</p><p num="p0057">In one embodiment, the antisense oligomer is an oligonucleotide that is sufficiently complementary to a TBCIDI mRNA to bind to and prevent translation, preferably by binding to the 5 ' untranslated region. TBClDl-specific antisense oligonucleotides, preferably range from at least 6 to about 200 nucleotides. In some embodiments the oligonucleotide is preferably at least 10, 15, or 20 nucleotides in length. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide is preferably less than 50, 40, or 30 nucleotides in length. The oligonucleotide can be DNA or RNA or a chimeric mixture or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone. The oligonucleotide may include other appending groups such as peptides, agents that facilitate transport across the cell membrane, hybridization-triggered cleavage agents, and intercalating agents.</p><p num="p0058">In another embodiment, the antisense oligomer is a phosphothioate morpholino oligomer (PMO). PMOs are assembled from four different morpholino subunits, each of which contain one of four genetic bases (A, C, G, or T) linked to a six-membered morpholine ring. Polymers of these subunits are joined by non-ionic phosphodiamidate intersubunit linkages. Details of how to make and use PMOs and other antisense oligomers are well known in the art (e.g. see WO99/18193; Probst JC, Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide and Ribozyme Design, Methods.

Alternative preferred TBCIDI nucleic acid modulators are double-stranded RNA species mediating RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals and plants, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene.

Nucleic acid modulators are commonly used as research reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite specificity, are often used to elucidate the function of particular genes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,790). Nucleic acid modulators are also used, for example, to distinguish between functions of various members of a biological pathway. For example, antisense oligomers have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals and man and have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials to be safe and effective (Milligan JF, et al, Current Concepts in Antisense Drug Design, J Med Chem. (1993) 36:1923-1937; Tonkinson JL et al, Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides as Clinical Therapeutic Agents, Cancer Invest. (1996) 14:54-65). Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, a TBClDl-specific nucleic acid modulator is used in an assay to further elucidate the role of the TBCIDI in the p53 pathway, and/or its relationship to other members of the pathway.

As used herein, an "assay system" encompasses all the components required for performing and analyzing results of an assay that detects and/or measures a particular event. In general, primary assays are used to identify or confirm a modulator's specific biochemical or molecular effect with respect to the TBCIDI nucleic acid or protein. In general, secondary assays further assess the activity of a TBCIDI modulating agent identified by a primary assay and may confirm that the modulating agent affects TBCIDI in a manner relevant to the p53 pathway. In some cases, TBCIDI modulators will be directly tested in a secondary assay.

 In a preferred embodiment, the screening method comprises contacting a suitable assay system comprising a TBCIDI polypeptide with a candidate agent under conditions whereby, but for the presence of the agent, the system provides a reference activity (e.g. binding activity), which is based on the particular molecular event the screening method detects. A statistically significant difference between the agent-biased activity and the reference activity indicates that the candidate agent modulates TBCIDI activity, and hence the p53 pathway.</p><p num="p0061">Primary Assays The type of modulator tested generally determines the type of primary assay.</p><p num="p0062">Primary assays for small molecule modulators</p><p num="p0063">For small molecule modulators, screening assays are used to identify candidate modulators. Screening assays may be cell-based or may use a cell-free system that recreates or retains the relevant biochemical reaction of the target protein (reviewed in Sittampalam GS et al, Curr Opin Chem Biol (1997) 1:384-91 and accompanying references). As used herein the term "cell-based" refers to assays using live cells, dead cells, or a particular cellular fraction, such as a membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondrial fraction. The term "cell free" encompasses assays using substantially purified protein (either endogenous or recombinantly produced), partially purified or crude cellular extracts. Screening assays may detect a variety of molecular events, including protein-DNA interactions, protein-protein interactions (e.g., receptor-ligand binding), transcriptional activity (e.g., using a reporter gene), enzymatic activity (e.g., via a property of the substrate), activity of second messengers, immunogenicty and changes in cellular morphology or other cellular characteristics. Appropriate screening assays may use a wide range of detection methods including fluorescent, radioactive, colorimetric, spectre-photometric, and amperometric methods, to provide a read-out for the particular molecular event detected.</p><p num="p0064">Cell-based screening assays usually require systems for recombinant expression of TBCIDI and any auxiliary proteins demanded by the particular assay.

elucidation of protein complexes. In certain applications, when TBClDl-interacting proteins are used in screens to identify small molecule modulators, the binding specificity of the interacting protein to the TBCIDI protein may be assayed by various known methods such as substrate processing (e.g. ability of the candidate TBClDl-specific binding agents to function as negative effectors in TBClDl-expressing cells), binding equilibrium constants (usually at least about 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, preferably at least about 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, more preferably at least about 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>1</sup>), and immunogenicity (e.g. ability to elicit TBCIDI specific antibody in a heterologous host such as a mouse, rat, goat or rabbit). For enzymes and receptors, binding may be assayed by, respectively, substrate and ligand processing. The screening assay may measure a candidate agent's ability to specifically bind to or modulate activity of a TBCIDI polypeptide, a fusion protein thereof, or to cells or membranes bearing the polypeptide or fusion protein. The TBCIDI polypeptide can be full length or a fragment thereof that retains functional TBCIDI activity. The TBCIDI polypeptide may be fused to another polypeptide, such as a peptide tag for detection or anchoring, or to another tag. The TBCIDI polypeptide is preferably human TBCIDI, or is an ortholog or derivative thereof as described above.

Matrigel® is an extract of basement membrane proteins, and is composed primarily of laminin, collagen IV, and heparin sulfate proteoglycan. It is provided as a sterile liquid at 4° C, but rapidly forms a solid gel at 37° C. Liquid Matrigel® is mixed with various angiogenic agents, such as bFGF and VEGF, or with human tumor cells which over-express the TBCIDI. The mixture is then injected subcutaneously(SC) into female athymic nude mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY) to support an intense vascular response. Mice with Matrigel® pellets may be dosed via oral (PO), intraperitoneal (IP), or intravenous (JV) routes with the candidate modulator. Mice are euthanized 5 - 12 days post-injection, and the Matrigel® pellet is harvested for hemoglobin analysis (Sigma plasma hemoglobin kit). Hemoglobin content of the gel is found to correlate the degree of neovascularization in the gel.</p><p num="p0089">In another preferred embodiment, the effect of the candidate modulator on TBCIDI is assessed via tumorigenicity assays. In one example, xenograft human tumors are implanted SC into female athymic mice, 6-7 week old, as single cell suspensions either 
<!-- EPO <DP n="29"/>-->
from a pre-existing tumor or from in vitro culture. The tumors which express the TBCIDI endogenously are injected in the flank, 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> to 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells per mouse in a volume of 100 μL using a 27gauge needle. Mice are then ear tagged and tumors are measured twice weekly. Candidate modulator treatment is initiated on the day the mean tumor weight reaches 100 mg. Candidate modulator is delivered IV, SC, IP, or PO by bolus administration. Depending upon the pharmacokinetics of each unique candidate modulator, dosing can be performed multiple times per day. The tumor weight is assessed by measuring perpendicular diameters with a caliper and calculated by multiplying the measurements of diameters in two dimensions. At the end of the experiment, the excised tumors maybe utilized for biomarker identification or further analyses. For immunohistochemistry staining, xenograft tumors are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1M phosphate, pH 7.2, for 6 hours at 4°C, immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS, and rapidly frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen.</p><p num="p0090">Diagnostic and therapeutic uses</p><p num="p0091">Specific TBClDl-modulating agents are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications where disease or disease prognosis is related to defects in the p53 pathway, such as angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation disorders. Accordingly, the invention also provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway in a cell, preferably a cell pre-determined to have defective p53 function, comprising the step of administering an agent to the cell that specifically modulates TBCIDI activity. Preferably, the modulating agent produces a detectable phenotypic change in the cell indicating that the p53 function is restored, i.e., for example, the cell undergoes normal proliferation or progression through the cell cycle. The discovery that TBCIDI is implicated in p53 pathway provides for a variety of methods that can be employed for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of diseases and disorders involving defects in the p53 pathway and for the identification of subjects having a predisposition to such diseases and disorders.</p><p num="p0092">Various expression analysis methods can be used to diagnose whether TBCIDI expression occurs in a particular sample, including Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR, and microarray analysis, (e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994) Ausubel FM et al, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chapter 4; Freeman WM et al, Biotechniques (1999) 26:112-125; Kallioniemi OP, Ann Med 2001, 33:142-147; Blohm and Guiseppi-Elie, Curr Opin Biotechnol 2001, 12:41-47).

Tissues having a disease or disorder implicating defective p53 signaling that express a TBCIDI, are identified as amenable to treatment with a TBCIDI modulating agent. In a preferred application, the p53 defective tissue overexpresses a TBCIDI relative to normal tissue. For example, a Northern blot analysis of mRNA from tumor and normal cell lines, or from tumor and matching normal tissue samples from the same patient, using full or partial TBCIDI cDNA sequences as probes, can determine whether particular tumors express or overexpress TBCIDI. Alternatively, the TaqMan® is used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of TBCIDI expression in cell lines, normal tissues and tumor samples (PE Applied Biosystems). Various other diagnostic methods may be performed, for example, utilizing reagents such as the TBCIDI oligonucleotides, and antibodies directed against a TBCIDI, as described above for: (1) the detection of the presence of TBCIDI gene mutations, or the detection of either over- or under-expression of TBCIDI mRNA relative to the non- disorder state; (2) the detection of either an over- or an under-abundance of TBCIDI gene product relative to the non-disorder state; and (3) the detection of perturbations or abnormalities in the signal transduction pathway mediated by TBCIDI.</p><p num="p0093">Thus, in a specific embodiment, the invention is drawn to a method for diagnosing a disease in a patient, the method comprising: a) obtaining a biological sample from the patient; b) contacting the sample with a probe for TBCIDI expression; c) comparing results from step (b) with a control; and d) determining whether step (c) indicates a likelihood of disease. Preferably, the disease is cancer, most preferably a cancer as shown in TABLE 1. The probe may be either DNA or protein, including an antibody.</p><p num="p0094">EXAMPLES The following experimental section and examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.</p><p num="p0095">I.

Increasing quantities of Drosophila p53 (titrated using different strength transgenic inserts in 1 or 2 copies) caused deterioration of normal wing morphology from mild to strong, with phenotypes including disruption of pattern and polarity of wing hairs, shortening and thickening of wing veins, progressive crumpling of the wing and appearance of dark "death" inclusions in wing blade.

Progeny containing insertions were compared to non-insertion-bearing sibling progeny for enhancement or suppression of the p53 phenotypes.
