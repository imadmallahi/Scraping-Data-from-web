load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p>The present invention is directed to a blocked polyisocyanate based
on nonane triisocyanate. More particularly, the invention is directed to a
blocked polyisocyanate useful in solvent borne coating compositions and
comprising the reaction product of: a) nonane triisocyanate; b) a pyrazole
blocking agent; and c) a diol or polyol.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0001">Nonane triisocyanate (NTI or 4-isocyanatomethyl-1,8-octane
diisocyanate) is a known material. Various uses for NTI have been
suggested. See, e.g., U.S. Patents 4,314,048; 5,714,564; 5,854,301;
6,084,051; 6,090,939; 6,100,326; 6,291,578; 6,399,691; 6,432,485;
6,433,072; 6,531,535; 6,566,444; and 6,605,669.</p><p num="0002">A market need exists for a high functionality, high NCO content, low
unblocking temperature polyurethane crosslinker. Pyrazole-blocked
isocyanates unblock at relatively low temperatures (see, e.g., U.S. Patents
4,976,837, 5,246,557, 5,521,272 and 5,986,033). The fully blocked
reaction product of nonane triisocyanate and a pyrazole meets the market
need as far as functionality, NCO content and unblocking temperature but
is not soluble in commercially used coating solvents (see U.S. application
<u style="single">          </u>, filed on the same day as the present application (attorney docket
number PO-7999)) and as a result has limited usefulness in the coating
area.</p><heading><u style="single">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0003">The present invention is directed to a blocked polyisocyanate based
on nonane triisocyanate. More particularly, the invention is directed to a
blocked polyisocyanate useful in solvent borne coating compositions and
comprising the reaction product of:
<sl><li>a) nonane triisocyanate;</li><li>b) a pyrazole blocking agent; and</li><li>c) a diol or polyol having a number average molecular weight of
from about 62 to about 600 and preferably from about 62 to
about 200,</li></sl>
wherein i) the isocyanate to hydroxy equivalent ratio of component a) to
component c) is from 1:0.15 to 1:0.6 and ii) the equivalent ratio of 
isocyanate groups to blocking groups is from 1:0.4 to 1:0.85. The invention
provides a composition useful in commonly used urethane grade solvents.</p><p num="0004">The pyrazole blocking agents are known and are disclosed, e.g., in
U.S. Patents 4,976,837, 5,246,557, 5,421,272 and 5,986,033, the
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The preferred
pyrazole blocking agents are selected from the group consisting of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole,
4-nitro-3,5-dimethylpyrazole, 4-benzyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazole,
methyl-5-methylpyrazole-3-carboxylate, pyrazole, 3-methyl-5-phenylpyrazole,
3-methylpyrazole, 4-bromo-3,5-dimethylpyrazole
and 3,5-dimethylpyrazole-4-carboxanilide, with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole being
most preferred.</p><p num="0005">As used herein, "NTI" is intended to mean nonane triisocyanate. As
is clear from the art, in addition to being called nonane triisocyanate (U.S.
Patent 6,084,051), nonane triisocyanate has been called i) 4-isocyanate
methyl-1,8-octamethylene diisocyanate (U.S. Patent 4,314,048), ii) 4-isocyantomethyl-1,8-octamethylene
diisocyanate, (U.S. Patent 5,714,564),
iii) 4-isocyanatomethyl-1,8-octane diisocyanate (U.S. Patent 6,090,939),
iv) triisocyanatononane and TIN (U.S. Patent 6,090,939), and v) 4-isocyanatomethyloctane-1,8-diisocyanate
(U.S. Patent 6,100,326).</p><p num="0006">The diols and polyols useful herein have number average molecular
weights of from about 62 to about 600 and preferably from about 62 to
about 200. Specifically useful diol and polyols include ethylene glycol;
diethylene glycol; triethylene glycol; propylene glycol; dipropylene glycol;
butane diols; hexane diols; glycerin; trimethylolethane; trimethylolpropane;
pentaerythritol; hexane triols; mannitol; sorbitol; glucose; fructose;
mannose; sucrose; and propoxylated and/or ethoxylated adducts of any of
the above-noted hydroxy functional materials having number average
molecular weights of up to about 600.</p><p num="0007">The three components can be reacted in any order. For example, in
the presently preferred method, the NTI and the diol or polyol are first
reacted and the pyrazole is reacted with the resultant product. 
Alternatively, the pyrazole could first be reacted with the NTI and the diol
or polyol could be reacted with the resultant product. in a less preferred
embodiment, the 'components could be reacted all at once. Regardless of
the method chosen, the amounts of reactants are such that i) the
isocyanate to hydroxy equivalent ratio of component a) (the NTI) to
component c) (the diol or polyol) is from 1:0.15 to 1:0.6, preferably from
1:0.15 to 1:0.25 and ii) the equivalent ratio of isocyanate groups to
blocking groups is from 1:0.4 to 1:0.85, preferably from 1:0.75 to 1:0.85.</p><p num="0008">Reaction times will depend on the reaction temperatures and the %
solids during reaction, but are typically between one and eight hours.
Reaction temperatures can be from 50°C to 120°C, with temperatures of
between 60° and 80°C being preferred to give reasonable reaction times
with low color. The solids content is typically between 50 and 90%. Higher
solids are preferred, but viscosities can be too high for practical use.
Typical non-hydroxyl urethane grade solvents can be used and include
ketones, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons and even aliphatic hydrocarbons
in combination with one of the previous solvents.</p><p num="0009">The invention is further illustrated by the following examples in
which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.</p><heading><b><u style="single">EXAMPLES</u></b></heading><p num="0010">In the examples, the NTI used was a commercially available NTI
having an isocyanate equivalent weight as determined by NCO end group
titration of 87 (in theory, the pure NTI would have an equivalent weight of
84).</p><heading><u style="single">Example 1</u></heading><p num="0011">A 500 ml round bottom flask fitted with stirrer, nitrogen inlet,
condenser and thermocouple was filled with 86.53 grams (1.0 equivalent)
of NTI and 9.18 grams (0.2 equivalent) of 1,3-butanediol. The reaction
mixture was heated with stirring to 85°C and held for two hours at which
time the NCO content was 35.20% by weight (theoretical 35.11 %). The
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and 31.85 g methyl 
propyl ketone and 77.04 grams (0.8 equivalent) of 3,5-dimethyl pyrazole
was added. The reaction mixture had a strong exotherm and an ice bath
was used to keep the temperature to no higher than 65°C. When the
exotherm was complete, heat was applied to maintain a reaction
temperature of 60°C. The 60°C reaction temperature was maintained for
four hours when an IR spectrum showed no isocyanate remaining. The
solids were 85% and the viscosity was &gt;100,000 cps @ 25°C. The
isocyanate content of the solution was 256 g/eq. No crystals formed after
one month, even after seeding with pure DMP blocked NTI from

30.21 grams of methyl propyl ketone and 64.57 grams (0.67 equivalent) of
3,5-dimethyl pyrazole were used. The isocyanate content of the adduct
was 27.8% by weight (theoretical 27.5%). The final product had a solids
content of 85% and the viscosity was &gt;100,000 cps @ 25°C. The
isocyanate content of the solution was 294 g/eq. No crystals formed after
one month, even after seeding with pure DMP blocked NTI from

mixture was heated with stirring to 50°C and 231.2 grams (2.409
equivalents) of 3,5-dimethyl pyrazole was added slowly. The reaction
mixture had a strong exotherm and an ice bath was used to keep the
temperature to no higher than 55°C. When the exotherm was complete,
heat was applied to maintain a reaction temperature of 50°C. The 50°C

showed no isocyanate remaining. The solids were 85% and the viscosity
