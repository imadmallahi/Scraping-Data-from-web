Female sexual dysfunction includes: decreased libido, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, dyspareunia, sexual ahedonia and vaginismus. The present combination is also preferred in the treatment or prevention of vaginal atrophy or skin atrophy including skin wrinkles and spots, and in increasing the frequency or intensity of orgasms. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is a disorder in which sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity are persistently or recurrently diminished or absent, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulties. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder may be lifelong or acquired, generalized (global) or situational (partner-specific). Sexual desire is a complex psychosomatic process based on brain activity (the "generator" or "motor" running in a rheostatic cyclic fashion), a poorly defined hormonal milieu, and cognitive scripting that includes sexual aspiration and motivation. Desynchronization of these components results in hypoactive sexual desire disorder.</p><p num="p0031">The acquired form of hypoactive sexual desire disorder is commonly caused by boredom or unhappiness in a long-standing relationship, depression (which leads more often to decreased interest in sex than it does to impotence in the male or to inhibited excitement in the female), dependence on alcohol or psychoactive drugs, side effects from prescription drugs (e.g., antihypertensives, antidepressaπts), and hormonal deficiencies. This disorder can be secondary to impaired sexual functioning in the arousal or orgasm phase of the sexual response cycle. Symptoms and signs of hypoactive sexual desire disorder include the patient complaining of a lack of interest in sex, even in ordinarily erotic situations. The disorder is usually associated with infrequent sexual activity, often causing serious marital conflict. Some patients have sexual encounters fairly often to please their partners and may have no difficulty with performance but continue to have sexual 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 apathy. When boredom is the cause, frequency of sex with the usual partner decreases, but sexual desire may be normal or even intense with others (the situational form).</p><p num="p0032">Sexual anhedonia (decreased or absent pleasure in sexual activity) is not an official diagnosis. It is almost always classified under hypoactive sexual desire disorder, because loss of pleasure almost always results in loss of desire (although loss of desire may occur first). The cause is likely to be depression or drugs if anhedonia is acquired and global (with all partners in all situations); interpersonal factors if anhedonia is confined to one partner or one situation; or repressive factors (e.g., guilt, shame) due to family dysfunction or childhood trauma if anhedonia is lifelong. Sexual aversion is the probable diagnosis in lifelong cases.</p><p num="p0033">Sexual arousal disorder is the persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain the lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement until completion of sexual activity. This disturbance occurs despite adequate focus, intensity, and duration of sexual stimulation. The disorder may be lifelong or, more commonly, acquired and restricted to the partner. The patient's complaints are usually related to lack of orgasm, although some women report lack of excitement.</p> <p num="p0034">Sexual pain disorders (includes dyspareunia and vaginismus) is characterized by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.</p><p num="p0035">Dyspareunia is painful coitus or attempted coitus. Dyspareunia is usually introital but may also occur before, during, or after intercourse. Causes include menopausal involution with dryness and thinning of the mucosa. Pain during or after coitus is the chief complaint.</p><p num="p0036">The term "patient" means a mammal having one or more of the conditions or diseases or at risk of having one or more of the conditions or diseases disclosed herein. Preferred patients are humans. An especially preferred patient is a postmenopausal woman. The term "treat" means to ameliorate or prevent the onset of or more symptom of a disease or condition.</p><p num="p0037">The above-identified diseases and conditions can be treated using a combination of an estrogen agonist / antagonist and an estrogen, or the combination of an estrogen agonist / antagonist, an estrogen and a progestin. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 A combination of an estrogen agonist / antagonist may comprise one or more estrogen agonist /antagonist and one or more estrogen. For example, a combination may contain one estrogen agonist /antagonist and two estrogens. Alternatively, the combination may contain more than one estrogen agonist / antagonist and one estrogen.</p><p num="p0038">The combinations of the present invention can be administered to a patient all at once, such as in the same tablet, or in multiple tablets taken at the same time. Alternatively the estrogen agonist /antagonist can be taken at one time and the estrogen taken at another time. For convenience, it is preferable to take both the estrogen agonist /antagonist and the estrogen at the same time. There are many ways in which the combinations of the present invention can be administered to a patient. It is contemplated that the present invention encompass the various ways of administering the estrogen agonists / antagonists and estrogens.</p> <p num="p0039">Also provided by the present invention are combinations for the treatment or prevention of the above-mentioned conditions or diseases that comprise an estrogen agonist / antagonist, an estrogen and a progestin. The combination can be administered in the same dosage form at the same time, in different dosage forms at the same time, or in different dosage forms at different times. All variations of administration methods and administration times are contemplated. For example, the estrogen agonist / antagonist, estrogen and progestin can be administered in separate tablets or capsules. In another embodiment, the estrogen agonist / antagonist and estrogen can be administered in one tablet and the progestin in a second tablet. It is also possible to use different dosage forms to administer the components of the combination. For example, some components can be administered by tablet or capsule and others delivered transdermally, such as by a patch. Nasal administration is also contemplated for the combinations of the present invention. It is also noted that more than one estrogen agonist / antagonist, estrogen or progestin can be used in the combinations.</p> <p num="p0040">The term "postmenopausal women" is defined to include not only women of advanced age who have passed through menopause, but also women who have been hysterectomized or for some other reason have suppressed estrogen production, such as those who have undergone long-term administration of corticosteroids, suffer from Cushions' syndrome or have gonadal dysgenesis.

 An "estrogen agonist / antagonist" is a compound that affects some of the same receptors that estrogen does, but not all, and in some instances, it antagonizes or blocks estrogen. It is also known as a "selective estrogen receptor modulator" (SERM). Estrogen agonists / antagonists may also be referred to as antiestrogens although they have some estrogenic activity at some estrogen receptors. Estrogen agonists / antagonists are therefore not what are commonly referred to as "pure antiestrogens". Antiestrogens that can also act as agonists are referred to as Type I antiestrogens. Type I antiestrogens activate the estrogen receptor to bind tightly in the nucleus for a prolonged time but with impaired receptor replenishment (Clark, et al., Steroids 1973;22:707, Capony et al., Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1975;3:233).</p> <p num="p0041">Preferred estrogen agonists / antagonists of the present invention include the compounds described in US 5,552,412.

Preferred salts of estrone include, but are not limited to, the sodium and piperate salts. Other salts are described below. Another type of compound that is useful in the present invention are the synthetic steroids such as tibolone (Livial<sup>®</sup>). The combination of an estrogen agonist / antagonist, particularly (-)-cis-6-phenyl-5-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)- phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphthalene-2-ol or a nontoxic pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, in combination with tibolone for the treatment of osteoporosis, to enhance libido, treat dyspareunia, treat sexual arousal disorder, treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder, treat vaginismus, or increase the frequency or intensity of orgasms is preferred. The use of tibolone and an estrogen agonist / antagonist can also optionally include a progestin.</p><p num="p0143">Progestins are familiar to those skilled in the art. Examples of specific progestins that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, levonorgestrel, norethindrone, ethynodiol, desogestrel, norgestrel, norgestimate, and medroxyprogesterone.

final step of the synthesis. The salt-forming acid is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, or aqueous organic solvent, such as an alkanol, ketone or ester. On the other hand, if the compound of this invention is desired in the free base form, it is isolated from a basic final wash step, according to the usual practice. A preferred technique for preparing hydrochlorides is to dissolve the free base in a suitable solvent and dry the solution thoroughly, as over molecular sieves, before bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through it. A preferred salt of (-)-cis-6-phenyl-5-[4- (2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphthalene-2-ol is the D-(-)- tartrate salt. It will also be recognized that it is possible to administer amorphous forms of the estrogen agonists / antagonists, estrogens and progestins.</p><p num="p0146">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that certain estrogen agonist / antagonists , estrogen or progestins will contain one or more atoms which may be in a particular stereochemical, tautomeric, or geometric configuration, giving rise to stereoisomers, tautomers and configurational isomers. All such isomers and mixtures thereof are included in this invention. Hydrates and solvates of the compounds of this invention are also contemplated.</p><p num="p0147">The subject invention also includes isotopically-labeled estrogen agonists / antagonists, estrogens or progestins, which are structurally identical to those disclosed above, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>0, <sup>17</sup>0, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, ^S, <sup>18</sup>F and <sup>36</sup>CI, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds and of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="24"/>-->
 Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out known or referenced procedures and by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Pharmaceutical chemists will easily recognize that physiologically active compounds which have accessible hydroxy groups are frequently administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable esters. The literature concerning such compounds, such as estradiol, provides a great number of instances of such esters. The compounds of this invention are no exception in this respect, and can be effectively administered as an ester, formed on the hydroxy groups. It is possible to adjust the rate or duration of action of the compound by appropriate choices of ester groups.</p><p num="p0148">As used herein, the term "effective amount" means an amount of compound of the compositions, kits and methods of the present invention that is capable of treating the described conditions or diseases. The specific dose of a compound administered according to this invention will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case including, for example, the compound administered, the route of administration, the state of being of the patient, and the severity of the pathological condition being treated.</p><p num="p0149">The dose of a compound of this invention to be administered to a subject is rather widely variable and subject to the judgement of the attending physician. It should be noted that it may be necessary to adjust the dose of a compound when it is administered in the form of a salt, such as a laureate, the salt forming moiety of which has an appreciable molecular weight.</p><p num="p0150">The following dosage amounts and other dosage amounts set forth elsewhere in this description and in the appendant claims are for an average human subject having a weight of about 65 kg to about 70 kg. The skilled practitioner will readily be able to determine the dosage amount required for a subject whose weight falls outside the 65 kg to 70 kg range, based upon the medical history of the subject and the presence of diseases, e.g., diabetes, in the subject. Ail doses set forth herein, and in the appendant claims, are daily doses.</p><p num="p0151">The general range of effective administration rates of the estrogen agonists / antagonists is from about 0.001 mg/day to about 200 mg/day. A preferred rate range is from about 0.010 mg/day to 100 mg/day. Of course, it is often practical to administer the daily dose of compound in portions, at various 
<!-- EPO <DP n="25"/>-->
hours of the day. However, in any given case, the amount of compound administered will depend on such factors as the potency of the specific estrogen agonist/antagonist, the solubility of the compound, the formulation used and the route of administration. An acceptable dosage range for estrogens includes, but is not limited to, about 0.001 mg/day to about 100 mg/day. A preferred estrogen dosage range includes, but is not limited to about 0.010 mg/day to about 2 mg/day. An acceptable dosage range for progestins includes, but is not limited to about 0.001 mg/day to about 1000 mg/day. A preferred dosage range for the progestins is about 0.1 mg/day to about 500 mg/day.</p><p num="p0152">Methods of formulation are well known in the art and are disclosed, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Alfonso R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 19th Edition (1995). Pharmaceutical compositions for use within the present invention can be in the form of sterile, non-pyrogenic liquid solutions or suspensions, coated capsules, suppositories, lyophilized powders, transdermal patches or other forms known in the art.</p><p num="p0153">Capsules are prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable diluent and filling the proper amount of the mixture in capsules. The usual diluents include inert powdered substances such as starch of many different kinds, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain flours and similar edible powders.</p><p num="p0154">Tablets are prepared by direct compression, by wet granulation, or by dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate diluents, binders, lubricants and disintegrators as well as the compound. Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders are substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, glucose and the like. Natural and synthetic gums are also convenient, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and the like. Polyethylene glycol, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders.</p><p num="p0155">A lubricant may be necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery

solids as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils.</p><p num="p0156">Tablet disintegrators are substances which facilitate the disintegration of a tablet to release a compound when the tablet becomes wet. They include starches, clays, celluloses, algins and gums, more particularly, corn and potato starches, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, wood cellulose, powdered natural sponge, cation- exchange resins, alginic acid, guar gum, citrus pulp and carboxymethylcellulose, for example, may be used as well as sodium lauryl sulfate.</p><p num="p0157">Tablets are often coated with sugar as a flavorant and sealant, or with film- forming protecting agents to modify the dissolution properties of the tablet. The compounds may also be formulated as chewable tablets, by using large amounts of pleasant-tasting substances such as mannitol in the formulation, as is now well- established in the art.</p><p num="p0158">When it is desired to administer a compound as a suppository, the typical bases may be used. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, which may be modified by addition of waxes to raise its melting point slightly. Water-miscible suppository bases comprising, particularly, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights are in wide use.</p><p num="p0159">The effect of the compounds may be delayed or prolonged by proper formulation. For example, a slowly soluble pellet of the compound may be prepared and incorporated in a tablet or capsule. The technique may be improved by making pellets of several different dissolution rates and filling capsules with a mixture of the pellets. Tablets or capsules may be coated with a film which resists dissolution for a predictable period of time. Topical formulations may be designed to yield delayed and/or prolonged percutaneous absorption of a compound. Even the parenteral preparations may be made long-acting, by dissolving or suspending the compound in oily or emulsified vehicles which allow it to disperse only slowly in the serum.</p><p num="p0160">The term "prodrug" means a compound that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of the present invention. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms, such as through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W.

For example, two or more components can be in the same container with the third being in another container. All variations are envisioned. Also, when more than one compound of the same type is used (i.e., two or more estrogen agonists / antagonists), the compounds may be in the same dosage form in the same container or in different dosage forms in the same container or in different containers. Again, all variations are envisioned. A "kit" as used in the instant application includes one or more containers for containing the pharmaceutical compositions comprising the estrogen agonist / antagonist, estrogen and progestin, and may also include divided containers such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. The containers can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="29"/>-->
 pharmaceutically acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a re-sealable bag (for example, to hold a "refill" of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The containers employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets may be contained in a bottle, which is in turn contained within a box. An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of individual tablets or capsules to be packed or may have the size and shape to accommodate multiple tablets and/or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses accordingly and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are individually sealed or collectively sealed, as desired, in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets br capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.</p><p num="p0169">It may be desirable to provide a written memory aid, where the written memory aid is of the type containing information and/or instructions for the physician, pharmacist or subject, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested or a card which contains the same type of information. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday," . . . etc</p><p num="p0170">"Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . ." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several

tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day. When the kit contains separate compositions, a daily dose of one or more compositions of the kit can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of another one or more compositions of the kit can consist of several tablets or capsules. Another specific embodiment of a kit is a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.</p><p num="p0171">The combinations of the present invention are preferably dosed daily, including once, twice or three times a day. However, it is contemplated that the combination or components of the combination may not be administered daily. For example, the estrogen agonist / antagonist could be administered one each week, once each month or every other day. Each component of the combination could be administered non-daily. It is also possible that some components of the combination could be administered daily while other are administered non-daily. A preferred administration route employs the use of a single daily dosage form such as tablets or capsules that are administered on a daily basis.</p><p num="p0172">The example presented herein is intended to illustrate specific aspects of the invention and are not intended to limit the specification or the claims in any manner.

A pQCT X-ray machine (Stratec XCT Reasearch M, Norland Medical Systems, Fort Atkinson, Wl) with version 5.40 was used to scan femurs from this study. A cross sectional slice 1 mm in thickness was taken of the femoral metaphysis approximately 5 mm proximal to the distal end. A voxel size of 0.10 mm was used, with dimensions of 100 x 100 x 1000 micometers. Cortical bone was defined and analyzed using contour mode 2 and cortical mode 4. The cortical shell was distinguished from soft tissue with an outer threshold setting of 349 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, cortical bone along the endocortical surface was determined with an inner threshold of 529 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>. In order to determine the presence of trabecular bone, peel mode 4 was used. (Sub)Cortical bone was distinguished from cancellous bone with a threshold setting of 655 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>. An additional concentric peel was also used to eliminate (sub)cortical bone from any analyses. For trabecular and cortical bone, content, density and area were determined. Repositioning resulted in precision ranging from 0.99% to 3.49%. • Proximal tibial metaphyseal cancellous bone histomorphometry. Tibiae were removed upon necropsy and removed of tissue. The proximal portion of the tibia was fixed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol, defatted in acetone, and embedded in methyl methacrylate. Four and ten μm sections were taken to determine several histomorphometric parameters with an Image Analysis System (Osteomeasure, Inc., Atlanta, GA). The 10 μm remained unstained while the 4 μm section was stained with modified Masson's Trichrome stain (5,6,7).</p><p num="p0186">Statistics</p><p num="p0187">Statistics were calculated using StatView4.0 software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA).

SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS</p><p num="p0200">• LAS alone, EE alone, or combination of EE and LAS, completely prevented OVX- induced bone loss when administered at the fully efficacious doses. • Prevention of bone loss in lasofoxifene-treated OVX rats was achieved by the inhibition of bone resorption (decreased osteoclast number and surface) and bone turnover (decreased bone formation rate/bone surface) associated with OVX. The tissue level mechanism for the bone protective effects of EE and LAS appear to be similar.</p><p num="p0201">• No synergistic or antagonistic effects were seen in bone mass and dynamic histomorphometric parameters when co-administration of EE and LAS.</p><p num="p0202">• LAS antagonized the uterine hypertrophy effects induced by EE when co- administration was given to OVX rats.</p><p num="p0203">• Our data support the strategy of using a SERM for antagonizing the estrogen's uterine effects but maintaining the bone protective effect of estrogen for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p><p num="p0204">REFERENCES</p><p num="p0205">1.
