microorganisms containing DNA coding for human
preproparathyroid hormone.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND</u><u style="single">OF</u><u style="single">THE</u><u style="single">INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0002">A number of proteins and peptides that are normally
synthesized by mammalian cells have proven to have
medical, agricultural and industrial utility. These
proteins and peptides may be of different molecular size
and have a number of different functions, for example,
they may be enzymes, structural proteins, growth factors
and hormones. In essence both proteins and peptides are
composed of linear sequences of amino acids which form
secondary and tertiary structures that are necessary to
convey the biological activity. Human parathyroid
hormone has a relatively small molecular weight, which
has made it possible to synthesize the peptide chemically
by the sequential addition of amino acids. Thus,
parathyroid hormone is commercially available, but in
very small quantities at high cost. As a result, there
is no human parathyroid hormone available at a reasonable
price to supply the many potential medical, agricultural
and industrial applications.</p><p num="0003">During the past ten years, microbiological
techniques employing recombinant DNA have made it
possible to use microorganisms for the production of
species-different peptides. The microorganism is capable
of rapid and abundant growth and can be made to 
synthesize the foreign product in the same manner as
bacterial peptides. The utility and potential of this
molecular biological approach has already been proven by
microbiological production of a number of human proteins
that are now available for medical and other uses.</p><p num="0004">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is one of the most
important regulators of calcium metabolism in mammals and
is also related to several diseases in humans and
animals, e.g. milk fever, acute hypocalsemia and
otherwise pathologically altered blood calcium levels.
This hormone therefore will be important as a part of
diagnostic kits and will also have potential as a
therapeutic in human and veterinary medicine.</p><p num="0005">The first synthesis of DNA for human
prepropacathyroid hormone was described by Hendy, G.N.,
Kronenberg, H.M., Potts, Jr. J.T. and Rich, A., 78 Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. 7365-7369 (1981). DNA complementary in
sequence to PTH mRNA was synthesized and made double
stranded (Hendy et al., <u style="single">supra</u>). This cDNA was cloned in
pBR 322 DNA and E. coli 1776 was transfected. Of the
colonies with correct antibiotic resistance, 23 out of
200 clones were identified as containing specific human
PTH cDNA inserts. However, none of the 23 human PTH
clones contained the full length insert (Hendy et al.,
<u style="single">supra</u>). Later Breyel, E.; Morelle, G., Auf'mkolk, B.,
Frank, R., Blocker, H. and Mayer, H., <u style="single">Third European
Congress on</u><u style="single">Biotechnology,</u> 10-14 September 1984, Vol. B,
363-369, described the presence of the human PTH gene in
a fetal liver genomic DNA library constructed in the
phage Charon 4A. A restriction enzyme fragment of the
PTH gene was recloned and transfected into E. coli.</p><p num="0006">However, the work of Breyel et al., <u style="single">supra,</u>
demonstrated that E. coli degrades human PTH. Thus, a
microorganism which shows a stable production of intact
human parathyroid hormone has so far not been described.
Further, parathyroid hormone has never before been
isolated from yeast. </p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY</u><u style="single">OF</u><u style="single">THE</u><u style="single">INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0007">Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a plasmid containing DNA coding
for human preproparathyroid hormone (HPTH) for
insertion in Escherichia coli. It is another object
of the present invention to provide a genetically
engineered E. coli containing DNA coding for human
preproparathyroid hormone.</p><p num="0008">A further object of the present invention is to
provide a plasmid for insertion in yeast containing
DNA coding for parathyroid hormone. It is also an
object of the present invention to provide a
transformed yeast containing DNA coding for
parathyroid hormone, including human parathyroid
hormone, and from which transformed yeast, parathyroid
hormone may be obtained.</p><p num="0009">Other objects and advantages of the present
invention will become apparent as the description
thereof proceeds.</p><p num="0010">In satisfaction of the foregoing objects and
advantages, there is provided by the present invention
a novel plasmid for insertion in E. coli, containing
DNA coding for human preproparathyroid hormone. The
plasmid, when inserted into E. coli, functions to
transform the E. coli such that the E. coli then
produces multiple copies of the plasmid, and thus of
the cDNA coding for human preproparathyroid hormone.
The plasmid for insertion into E. coli of the present
invention and thus the transformed E. coli are
distinguishable over prior art plasmids and
microorganisms, for example as described in Hendy et
al., <u style="single">supra,</u> in that the plasmid of the present
invention contains a double start codon at the 5' end
of the DNA coding for preproparathyroid hormone. The
presence of the double start codon may cause a
production microorganism transformed with a plasmid 
containing this cDNA to produce preproparathyroid
hormone at an increased rate and in an improved yield
over prior art transformed microorganisms.</p><p num="0011">There is further provided by the present
invention a plasmid for insertion in yeast containing
DNA coding for parathyroid hormone. In a preferred
embodiment, this plasmid is prepared by recloning the
plasmid for insertion in E. coli described above.
Finally, the invention provides a yeast transformed by
said plasmid for insertion in yeast such that the
yeast produces and secretes parathyroid hormone.
Thus, the invention provides a method by which
parathyroid hormone may be isolated from yeast culture
medium. In a preferred embodiment, the transformed
yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In another
preferred embodiment, the parathyroid hormone is human
parathyroid hormone.</p><p num="0012">Samples of pSSHPTH-10, E. coli transformed
therewith, pSSαLX5-HPTH1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae

directed to a plasmid for insertion in E. coli
containing DNA coding for human preproparathyroid 
hormone. The invention is also directed to the
resulting transformed E. coli.</p><p num="0019">The invention further is directed to a plasmid
for insertion into yeast which contains DNA coding for
parathyroid hormone and which is derived from the
plasmid for insertion into E. coli. Finally, the
invention is directed to a transformed yeast from
which parathyroid hormone may be recovered.</p><p num="0020">The invention further provides methods of
producing and isolating the plasmids and transformed
microorganisms. Poly(A) selected RNA was isolated
from human parathyroid adenomas collected immediately
after surgery. The poly(A) RNA was enriched for
correct size mRNA by ultracentrifugation through
sucrose gradients. Preproparathyroid hormone of
correct molecular weight was translated <u style="single">in</u><u style="single">vitro</u> from
this size fractionated poly(A) RNA as judged by sodium
dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
after immuno precipitation with antiparathyroid
antiserum. The specific messenger RNA for the human
PTH was used as template for complementary DNA
synthesis using oligo d(T)18 as a primer and avian
myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. After
removal of the RNA templates by alkali hydrolysis,
the second strand complementary DNA was synthesized by
incubating the purified first strand DNA in the
presence of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA
polymerase I. The double stranded complementary DNA
was made blunt ended by the action of Aspergillus
oryzae single strand specific endonuclease Sl and
complementary DNA longer than 500 base pairs was
isolated after neutral sucrose gradient
centrifugation. Approximately 20 bases long d(C)-tail
protrusions were enzymatically added to the 3' ends of
the cDNA. This modified complementary DNA was
annealed to restriction endonuclease PstI cleaved and
d(G)-tailed vector pBR 322. Resulting recombinant 
plasmid DNA's were transformed into E. coli KI2 BJ
5183. Positive transformants were analysed for by
colony hybridization using two different synthetic
deoxyribo-oligonucleotides which covered the
N-terminal coding region as well as the 3' noncoding
part of the hormone mRNA sequence, respectively. Six
out of 66 clones that were positive for both probes
were submitted for detailed analysis by restriction
endonuclease mapping showing that they all were
identical except for some size heterogenity at the
regions flanking the start codon and the XbaI site 3'
for the stop codon. One clone, pSSHPTH-10, was
subjected to DNA sequence analysis revealing a 432
nucleotide long human parathyroid hormone
complementary DNA sequence inserted in the PstI site
of pBR 322. The entire cDNA sequence was found to be
identical to the sequence previously described by
Hendy, et al., <u style="single">supra,</u> except for a five base pair
deletion in front of the start codon.</p><p num="0021">The invention further provides a plasmid for
insertion into yeast containing DNA coding for
parathyroid hormone. The parathyroid hormone may be
human or animal parathyroid hormone, for example pig
or bovine parathyroid hormone. The plasmid for
insertion in yeast of the present invention may be
recloned from plasmids containing DNA coding for human
or animal parathyroid hormone. In a preferred 
embodiment, the plasmid for insertion in yeast
contains DNA coding for human parathyroid hormone. As
shown in the following examples, the HPTH sequence
from pSSHPTH-10 has been recloned and inserted in
specially designed vectors for expression in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

   pSSHPTH-10 was digested to form a 288 bp
BglII-XbaI fragment. This fragment was then subcloned
into pUC19 between the BamHI and XbaI sites. The
subclone was then digested with Don I, and the largest
resulting fragment was isolated. The said fragment
was then digested with Sall.</p><p num="0022">The plasmid pSSαLXS-HPTH1 that in yeast MATα
cells leads to the expression and secretion of PTH
was constructed in three stages:
<sl><li>1. Construction of the yeast shuttle vector pL4
(which replicates in both E. coli and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae).</li><li>2. Cloning of a DNA fragment containing the
yeast mating pheromone MFα1 gene and its
insertion into the yeast shuttle vector to
make the pαLX5 vector.</li><li>3. Insertion of a DNA fragment from the coding
region of the HPTH gene of pSSHPTH-10 into
pαLX5 in reading frame with the prepro part
of the MFα1 gene, thereby producing the
vector pSSαLX5-HPTH1.</li></sl></p><p num="0023">The shuttle vector pL4 was constructed by
inserting into pJDB207, an EcoRI-AvaII fragment
containing the ADHI promoter isolated from pADH040. A
SphI fragment was then deleted, resulting in a plasmid
pALX1. The PstI site in the β-lactamase gene was
deleted and the plasmid was partially digested with
PvuI and BglI and ligated to a PvuI BglI fragment of
pUC8, to form pALX2. After a further oligonucleotide
