and a method for producing isocyanates by using the carbamates produced
by the method for producing carbamates.</p><heading><b>Description of the Prior Art</b></heading><p num="0002">Alkyl carbamates are organic compounds useful as raw materials of
medicines, agricultural chemicals and the like; raw materials of a variety of
fine chemicals; reagents for analysis of alcohols; and industrial raw
materials used for various purposes.</p><p num="0003">A variety of methods for producing alkyl carbamates are known,
including (1) a method of reacting isocyanate with alcohol, (2) a method of
reacting chloroformate ester with amine in the presence of base, (3) a
method of reacting phosgene with alcohol and amine, (4) a method of
reacting urea with alcohol, (5) a method of reacting dimethyl carbonate
with formamide, and (6) a method of reacting dialkyl carbonate with
amine.</p><p num="0004">In recent years, many studies have been made for the uses of the
alkyl carbamates as raw materials for producing isocyanates without using
any phosgene.</p><p num="0005">Isocyanates is an organic compound containing an isocyanate group
and is in wide use as raw materials of polyurethanes. Isocyanates is 
produced industrially by reacting amine with phosgene (Phosgenation).
However, phosgene is highly toxic, corrosive and inconvenient in handling.
In recent years, as an alternative to the phosgenation, a variety of methods
for producing isocyanates economically have been proposed, according to
which after carbamates are prepared from amine by using dialkyl
carbonate, the carbamates obtained are thermally decomposed to thereby
produce isocyanates (e.g. Japanese Laid-open (Unexamined) Patent
Publications No. 7(1995)-165696, No. 6(1994)-172292, and No.
9(1997)-249633).</p><p num="0006">The methods for producing the alkyl carbamates cited above have the
following disadvantages, however. The method (1) has the disadvantage
that an irritating isocyanate must be handled as raw material and
accordingly careful handling is required. The method (2) has the
disadvantage that a base of a number of moles equal to or more than
equimolar must be used. The method (3) has the disadvantages that
phosgene is highly toxic and corrosive and that a base must be used in the
reaction. The methods (4) and (5) have the disadvantage that the reaction
must be done at high temperature or high pressure.</p><p num="0007">In the method (6), dimethyl carbonate is used as dialkyl carbonates
(which is well known from Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 51
(1976)-33095, Japanese Laid-open (Unexamined) Patent Publication No.
57(1982)-82361, and US Patent No. 4,395,565, for example). In this
method, dimethyl carbonate is allowed to react with amine in the presence
of a Lewis-acid, a lead, titanium or zirconium catalyst, or an alcoholate of
alkali metal or alkali earth metal. The examples of this method show, 
however, that the rate of reaction is generally slow and also a N-methyl
compound as a by-product is easily produced by the reaction. Due to this,
the method (6) has the disadvantage that it is hard to provide improvement
in space time yield (STY) of carbamates.</p><p num="0008">On the other hand, for example, Japanese Laid-open (Unexamined)
Patent Publication No. Sho 64(1989)-85956 describes, as a method which
suppresses the N-methylation reaction, the method by adding amine and
alcoholate catalyst of alkali metal or alkali earth metal continuously or
intermittently.</p><p num="0009">However, since this method requires a large amount of alcoholate
catalyst for producing carbamates at high yields, production costs increase
unavoidably. In addition, since the catalyst is neutralized, a large amount
of salt is produced and resultantly a considerable burden is put on the
recovery and purification of carbamates.</p><p num="0010">Further, an alternative method using carbonates has been proposed,
for example, by Japanese Laid-open (Unexamined) Patent Publication No.
Hei 6(1994)-128215 which teaches the method of producing an alkyl
carbamate from alkyl aryl carbonate and aromatic amine. In this method,
a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound is used as the catalyst.
However, this method has the disadvantage that a large amount of the
catalyst is required and improvement in yield cannot be attained.</p><p num="0011">In the methods for producing isocyanates previously mentioned, after
carbamates are prepared from amine by using dialkyl carbonate, the
carbamates obtained are thermally decomposed. However, as described,
for example, in the examples of Japanese Laid-open (Unexamined) Patent 
Publication No. Sho 64(1989)-85956, when a base catalyst is heated
together with carbamates, carbamates are changed further and are
changed into an unintended high boiling material. Due to this, the
neutralization process is unavoidable. As a matter of fact, prior to the
thermal decomposition process of carbamates, it is necessary that the
residual base catalyst in carbamates is neutralized by adding a phosphoric
acid and the phosphoric acid excessively added is eliminated by washing.</p><heading><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for
producing carbamates that enables carbamates to be produced in a simple
manner at low costs with high selectivity and high yield, and to provide a
method for producing isocyanates that enables isocyanates using
industrially to be produced by using the carbamates obtained by the
carbamates producing method.</p><p num="0013">The present invention provides a method for producing carbamates,
wherein nonaromatic amine selected from the group consisting of aliphatic
amine, alicyclic amine, and aralkyl amine is allowed to react with alkyl
aryl carbonate as is expressed by the following general formula (1):
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>1</sup>OCOOR<sup>2</sup></st32:che>
(where R<sup>1</sup> represents an alkyl group and R<sup>2</sup> represents an aryl group that
may have a substituent group).</p><p num="0014">In the method for producing carbamates of the present invention, it is
preferable that the alkyl aryl carbonate is methylphenyl carbonate. Also,
it is preferable that crude material containing at least 1 weight% of alkyl
aryl carbonate obtained by an ester exchange reaction of dialkyl carbonate 
with phenol or derivative thereof is used as the alkyl aryl carbonate.</p><p num="0015">It is preferable that the nonaromatic amine is at least one compound
selected from the group consisting of 1,6-hexamethylenediamine,
isophorone diamine, 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane,
1,4-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexaneamine),
2,5-bis(aminomethyl)bicyclo [2,2,1] heptane, 2,6-bis(aminomethyl)bicyclo
[2,2,1] heptane, 1,3-bis(aminomethyl) benzene and 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)
benzene. The nonaromatic amine may be amino acid and derivative
thereof.</p><p num="0016">Further, the present invention provides a method for producing
isocyanates which comprises the step of producing carbamates by reacting
nonaromatic amine selected from the group consisting of aliphatic amine,
alicyclic amine, and aralkyl amine with alkyl aryl carbonate expressed by
the following general formula (1), and the step of producing isocyanates by
thermally decomposing the carbamates obtained:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>1</sup>OCOOR<sup>2</sup></st32:che>
(where R<sup>1</sup> represents an alkyl group and R<sup>2</sup> represents an aryl group that
may have a substituent group).</p><p num="0017">The method for producing carbamates of the present invention
enables alkyl carbamates to be produced with high selectivity and at high
yield simply by substantially blending nonaromatic amine and alkylaryl

the following general formula (1):
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>1</sup>OCOOR<sup>2</sup></st32:che>
(where R<sup>1</sup> represents an alkyl group and R<sup>2</sup> represents an aryl group that
may have a substituent group).</p><p num="0028">In the formula (1) given above, the alkyl groups represented by R<sup>1</sup>
include, for example, normal or branched saturated hydrocarbon groups of
carbon number in the range of 1-8, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,
iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl,
octyl, iso-octyl, and 2-ethylhexyl, and alicyclic saturated hydrocarbon
groups of carbon number in the range of 5-10, such as cyclohexyl and
cyclododecyl.</p><p num="0029">In the formula (1) given above, aryl groups that may have a
substituent group represented by R<sup>2</sup> include, for example, aryl groups of
carbon number in the range of 6-18, such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, biphenyl,
naphthyl, anthryl, and phenanthryl. The substituent groups include, for
example, a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom (e.g. chlorine, fluorine, bromine,
and iodine), a cyano group, an amino group, a carboxyl group, an alkoxyl
group (e.g. alkoxyl group of the carbon number in the range of 1-4, such as 
methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, and butoxy), an aryloxy group (e.g. a phenoxy
group), an alkylthio group (e.g. alkylthio group of the carbon number in the
range of 1-4, such as methylthio, ethylthio, propylthio, and butylthio), and
an arylthio group (e.g. a phenylthio group). The number of substituent
groups per identical groups or different groups may be from one to five, or
preferably from one to three.</p><p num="0030">To be more specific, methylphenyl carbonate is preferably used as the
alkylaryl carbonate.</p><p num="0031">The alkylaryl carbonates cited above can be produced easily by using
any known methods, including, for example, a method for producing
alkylaryl carbonate by the ester exchange reaction of dialkyl carbonate and
phenol or derivatives thereof as described by Japanese Patent No. 1519075,
and a method for producing alkylaryl carbonate from aryl chloroformate
and alkyl alcohol as described by J. Org. Chem. 57,3237 (1992).</p><p num="0032">In the present invention, the reaction solution produced by the
producing method mentioned above may be used, or the crude material
containing alkylaryl carbonate may be used, as it is without any need to
use alkylaryl carbonate purified by high-level purification such as
recrystallization and fraction.</p><p num="0033">For example, when alkylaryl carbonate is produced from dialkyl
carbonate and phenol or derivatives thereof, crude material containing not
less than 1 weight%, or preferably 10-100 weight%, of alkylaryl carbonate
produced by the ester exchange reaction of dialkyl carbonate and phenol or
derivatives thereof may be used as the alkylaryl carbonate of the producing
method of the present invention. </p><p num="0034">When considering that alkylphenyl carbonate is produced by the
reaction of dialkyl carbonate and phenol, as mentioned above, it is feasible
to produce carbamates in the method mentioned later, for example, by
adding amine in the presence of dialkyl carbonate and phenol or by mixing
dialkyl carbonate, phenol and amine.</p><p num="0035">In the method for producing carbamates of the present invention, the
nonaromatic amine mentioned above is allowed to react with the alkylaryl
carbonate mentioned above. The nonaromatic amine is allowed to react
with alkylaryl carbonate, for example, in the manner that nonaromatic
amine and alkylaryl carbonate are charged in a reaction vessel in a
predetermined proportion given below under mild conditions and, if needed,
a reaction solvent is added thereto.</p><p num="0036">An amount of alkylaryl carbonate charged may be equivalent molar to
or more than the number of moles of animo group of the nonaromatic
amine. Due to this, alkylaryl carbonate itself may be used as a reaction
solvent in this reaction. To be more specific, the amount of alkylaryl
carbonate charged is commonly in the order of 1-50 times, or preferably
1.01-30 times, or further preferably 1.02-15 times, as much as the number
of moles corresponding to the number of amino group of nonaromatic amine.
If the amount of alkylaryl carbonate charged is more than that, then a
considerable amount of energy will be consumed in the subsequent
separation process or purification process, then providing inadequateness
for industrial production. On the other hand, if the amount of alkylaryl
carbonate charged is less than that, then there will be provided the result
that the rate of reaction decreases as the reaction proceeds. </p><p num="0037">The reaction solvent is not necessarily needed for this reaction, but
the blending of the reaction solvent can provide improved operability. No
particular limitation is imposed on the reaction solvent, as long as it is
inactive to or is less-reactive to nonaromatic amine and alkylaryl carbonate.
The reaction solvents that may be used include, for example, aliphatic
alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, and
iso-butanol), aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. hexane, pentane, petroleum ether,
ligroin, cyclododecane, and decalins), aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene,
toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, butylbenzene,
cyclohexylbenzene, tetralin, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene,
methylnaphthalene, chloronaphthalene, dibenzyltoluene,
triphenylmethane, phenylnaphthalene, biphenyl, diethyl biphenyl, and
triethyl biphenyl), ethers (e.g. diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether,
anisole, diphenyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether,
ethylene glycol diethyl ether, ethylene glycol dibutyl ether, diethylene
glycol dimethyl ether, and diethylene glycol diethyl ether), esters (e.g. ethyl
acetate, butyl acetate, amyl acetate, dioctyl phthalate, didesyl phthalate,
and didodecyl phthalate), nitriles (e.g. acetonitrile, propionitrile,
adiponitrile, and benzonitrile), aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g.
methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane,
and 1,4-dichlorobutane), amides (e.g. dimethylformamide, and
dimethylacetamide), nitro compounds (e.g. nitromethane, and
nitrobenzene), phenol or derivatives thereof (e.g. phenol and cresol), carboic
acid esters (e.g. dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate,
and dibutyl carbonate), heat medium oils for general use (e.g. Therm-S 
series, 200S, 300, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000S (Name of articles) available
from Nippon Steel Chemical Co., Ltd., and Neo SK-OIL 1300, 1400, 170,
240, 330, KSK-OIL 260, 280 (Name of articles) available from Soken
Chemical &amp; Engineering Co., Ltd.), N-methyl pyrrolizinone, N,N-dimethyl
imidazolidinone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and water.</p><p num="0038">Among these reaction solvents, aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic
hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, and carboic acid esters are
preferably used in terms of economical efficiency and operability. These
reaction solvents may be used singly or in combination of two or more.</p><p num="0039">There is no particular limitation to an amount of reaction solvent
used, as long as it is sufficient for the carbamates as a reaction product to
be dissolved. Industrially, the amount of reaction solvent used should
preferably be minimized as much as possible in view that it is necessary to
recover the reaction solvent from the reaction solution and the energy
consumed for the recovery can be reduced as much as possible, as well as in
view that when a large amount of reaction solvent is used, substrate
concentration on the reaction decreases and the rate of reaction decreases.
To be more specific, the amount of the reaction solvent used is usually in
the range of 0.01 to 50 parts by weight, or preferably in the range of 0.1 to
10 parts by weight per part by weight of nonaromatic amine.</p><p num="0040">In this reaction, reaction temperature varies, depending on kinds of
raw material, that is, nonaromatic amine and alkylaryl carbonate, and of
reaction solvent, though a reaction temperature is, for example, in the
range of 0-200°C, or preferably 20-150°C, or further preferably 30-100°C.
The reaction may be carried out in any adequate atmospheric pressure, 
under an increased pressure or a reduced pressure, without any particular
limitation.</p><p num="0041">This reaction proceeds without catalyst, but a catalyst may be added,
if desired. The catalysts that may be used, include, for example, known
carbamate preparation catalysts and ester exchange catalysts, such as
Lewis acid, alkali metal salt, alkali earth metal salt, salts of the group III
and IV metals, a nitrogen-containing compound, transition metal salt, or a
complex thereof.</p><p num="0042">This reaction can be carried out by agitating or mixing nonaromatic
amine and alkylaryl carbonate in the reaction vessel under the conditions
mentioned above. To be more specific, for example, nonaromatic amine
may be dropped in alkylaryl carbonate and mixed by stirring. This
permits alkyl carbamate to be produced with high selectivity and at high
yield under temperate conditions. As a result of this, for example, when
nonaromatic amine and alkylaryl carbonate are allowed to react with each
other without catalyst, this reaction provides the result that the reaction
solution after the end of the reaction contains excess (unreacted) alkylaryl
carbonate, reaction solvent, reaction product of carbamate expressed by the
general formula (2) given below:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">(R<sup>1</sup>OCONH)nR<sup>3</sup></st32:che>
(where R<sup>1</sup> represents R<sup>1</sup> of the formula (1) given above; R<sup>3</sup> represents
residue of nonaromatic amine; and n represents the number of amino group
of the nonaromatic amine), and

the by-product of aryl alcohol expressed by the general formula (3) given
below: <st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>2</sup>-OH</st32:che>
(where R<sup>2</sup> represents R<sup>2</sup> of the formula (1) given above).</p><p num="0043">These excess (unreacted) alkylaryl carbonate, reaction solvent and
aryl alcohol are recovered by distillation and separation and thereby the
carbamates produced are separated easily. This reaction usually requires
no after-treatment processes, such as separation of catalyst. The
carbamates obtained may be further purified by washing, neutralization,
recrystallization, distillation, sublimation, column chromatography or the
like, if needed.</p><p num="0044">Thus, this producing method enables alkyl carbamates to be produced
with high selectivity and at high yield simply by substantially blending
nonaromatic amine and alkylaryl carbonate. Besides, it requires simple
equipment and facility and requires no complicated after-treatment process.
Hence, the method of the present invention can produce the carbamates at
low costs and with efficiency.</p><p num="0045">The present invention includes a method for producing isocyanates by
thermally decomposing the carbamates obtained by the method for
producing carbamates described above.</p><p num="0046">According to the method for producing isocyanates of the present
invention, the carbamates obtained by the method for producing
carbamates described above is thermally decomposed to thereby produce
isocyanate expressed by the following general formula (4) corresponding to
the nonaromatic amine described above:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>3</sup>-(NCO)n</st32:che>
(where R<sup>3</sup> represents R<sup>3</sup> of the formula (2) given above, and n represents n 
of the formula (2) given above), and

the by-product of alkyl alcohol expressed by the following formula (5):
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>1</sup>-OH</st32:che>
(where R<sup>1</sup> represents R<sup>1</sup> of the formula (1) given above).</p><p num="0047">No particular limitation is imposed on the thermal decomposition.
Known decomposition methods, such as a liquid phase method and a vapor
phase method, can be used. Preferably, the thermal decomposition is
carried out in the liquid phase method, or rather, in the reaction
distillation in which the alkyl alcohol produced as a by-product in the
thermal decomposition is separated from the system.</p><p num="0048">The thermal decomposition temperature is usually 350°C at highest,
or preferably in the range of 80-350°C, or further preferably in the range of
100-300°C. At the thermal decomposition temperature lower than 80°C,
there is the possibility that the rate of reaction suitable for practical use
may not be obtained. At the thermal decomposition temperature higher
than 350°C on the other hand, there is the possibility that undesired side
reaction, such as polymerization of isocyanates, may occur. Also, it is
preferable that the pressure at the thermal decomposition reaction is a
pressure for allowing the alkyl alcohol produced to be vaporized in the
thermal decomposition temperature specified above. The pressure is
preferably in the range of 0.133-90kPa in terms of equipment and use and
profits suitable for practical use.</p><p num="0049">Though purified carbamates is good enough for the carbamates used
in the thermal decomposition, the crude material of carbamates obtained
by the recovery and separation of the aryl alcohol after the end of the 
reaction may continue to be thermally decomposed.</p><p num="0050">Further, catalyst and inactive solvent may be added, if needed. The
catalyst and inactive solvent may be added at the time when the reaction
for preparation of carbamates is carried out, around the time when the
distillation and separation is carried out after the end of the reaction, or
around the time when the carbamates is separated, though it depends on
the kinds of the catalyst and inactive solvent.</p><p num="0051">At least one compound of a metal, oxide, halogenide, carboxylate,
phosphate, and organic metallic compound, selected from the group
consisting of Sn, Sb, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, Ti, Pb, Mo and Mn, used for the
reaction of isocyanate and hydroxyl group for preparation of urethane, is
used as the decomposition catalyst used for the thermal decomposition. Of
these materials, Fe, Sn, Co, Sb and Mn are preferably used in this thermal
decomposition, because they develop the effect of suppressing the
production of the by-product.</p><p num="0052">Metallic catalysts of Sn that may be used include, for example, tin
oxide, tin chloride, tin bromide, tin iodide, tin formate, tin acetate, tin
oxalate, tin octylate, tin stearate, tin oleate, tin phosphate, dibutyltin
dichloride, dibutyltin dilaurate, and
1,1,3,3-Tetrabutyl-1,3-dilauryloxydistannoxane.</p><p num="0053">Metallic catalysts of Fe, Co, Sb and Mn include, for example, acetate,
benzoate, naphthenate, and acetylacetonate thereof.</p><p num="0054">It is to be noted that an amount of catalyst used to reaction is
preferably in the range of 0.0001-5 weight%, or preferably in the range of
0.001-1 weight% per reaction solvent, as a metal or compound thereof. </p><p num="0055">Also, the inactive solvent is inactive at least to carbamates and
isocyanates and it is preferable that the inactive solvent is also higher in
boiling point than isocyanates produced, for producing the thermal
decomposition reaction with efficiency. The inactive solvents that may be
used include, for example, esters, such as dioctyl phthalate, didecyl
phthalate, and didodecyl phthalate, and aromatic hydrocarbons or aliphatic
hydrocarbons used regularly as heating medium, such as dibenzyltoluene,
triphenylmethane, phenylnaphthalene, biphenyl, dietylbiphenyl, and
triethylbiphenyl. An amount of inactive solvent used is in the range of
0.001-100 parts by weight, or preferably 0.01-80 parts by weight, or further
preferably 0.1-50 parts by weight, per part by weight of carbamates. The
thermal decomposition reaction may be carried out by a batch reaction
process wherein carbamates, the catalyst and the inactive solvent are
charged as a batch, or by a continuous reaction process wherein
carbamates are charged in the inactive solvent containing the catalyst
under reduced pressure.</p><p num="0056">Thus, in this thermal decomposition reaction, the carbamates
obtained in the manner mentioned above is thermally decomposed and
thereby the isocyanates corresponding to the nonaromatic amines is
produced, as mentioned above. Consequently, for example,
polyisocyanates industrially used as raw material of polyurethane can be
produced in a simple manner and with efficiency.</p><p num="0057">While there has been described the method for producing carbamates
and the method for producing isocyanates so far, the production method of
the present invention may include some additional known processes, such 
as a head end process, such as a dehydration process, an intermediate
process, or an after-treatment process, such as a purification process and a
recovery process.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLES</b></heading><p num="0058">While in the following, the present invention will be described in
