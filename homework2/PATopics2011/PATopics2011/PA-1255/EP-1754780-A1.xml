status="new" lang="EN"><heading><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="p0001">The present invention relates to under-built highly soluble granular laundry detergent compositions comprising alkyl benzene sulphonate and a hydratable material. The compositions of the present invention have a good cleaning performance, good dispensing and dissolution profiles and good physical characteristics.</p><heading><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="p0002">There have been relatively recent attempts by many detergent manufacturers to significantly improve the dissolution and dispensing performance of their granular laundry detergents. The approach many detergent manufacturers have focused on is the significant reduction in the level of, or even the complete removal of, water-insoluble builder, such as zeolite builder, in/from their granular laundry detergent formulations. However, due to the phosphate-usage avoidance legislation in many countries which prevents the detergent manufacturers from incorporating a sufficient amount of phosphate-based water-soluble builders, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, in their granular laundry detergents, and due to the lack of feasible alternative non-phosphate based water-soluble builders available to the detergent manufacturers, the approach many detergent manufacturers have focused on is to not completely replace the zeolite-based builder system with a water-soluble builder system having an equivalent degree of builder capability, but instead to formulate an under-built granular laundry detergent composition.</p><p num="p0003">Whilst this under-built approach does significantly improve the dissolution and dispensing performance of the granular laundry detergent, problems do exist due to the significant amount of cations, such as calcium, that are not removed from the wash liquor by the builder-system of the granular laundry detergent composition during the laundering process. These cations interfere with the anionic detersive surfactant system of the granular laundry detergent composition in such a manner as to cause the anionic detersive<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> surfactant to precipitate out of solution, which leads to a reduction in the anionic detersive surfactant activity and cleaning performance. In extreme cases, these water-insoluble complexes may deposit onto the fabric resulting in poor whiteness maintenance and poor fabric integrity benefits. This is especially problematic when the laundry detergent is used in hard-water washing conditions when there is a high concentration of calcium cations.</p><p num="p0004">Another problem that needs to be overcome when the level of water-insoluble builders such as zeolite are significantly reduced in the composition, or when the zeolite is completely removed from the formulation, is the poor physical characteristics of the composition, especially after storage, which result in a poor cake strength.</p><p num="p0005">The Inventors have found that the cleaning performance and physical characteristics of under-built detergent compositions is improved by carefully controlling where and how much hydratable material is incorporated into the under-built detergent composition in relation to alkyl benzene sulphonate.</p><p num="p0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5552078A" status="new"><text>US 5,552,078 by Carr et al</text></patcit>, Church &amp; Dwight Co.

These levels and incorporation profile of hydratable material in the composition ensure that the composition has a good cleaning performance and good physical characteristics such as good cake strength, especially after storage.</p><p num="p0018">The composition typically has an equilibrium relative humidity of from 0% to less than 30%, preferably from 0% to 20%, when measured at a temperature of 35°C. Typically, the equilibrium relative humidity is determined as follows: 300g of composition is placed in a 1 litre container made of a water-impermeable material and fitted with a lid capable of sealing the container. The lid is provided with a scalable hole adapted to allow insertion of a probe into the interior of the container. The container and its contents are maintained at a temperature of 35°C for 24 hours to allow temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> equilibration. A solid state hygrometer (Hygrotest 6100 sold by Testoterm Ltd, Hapshire, UK) is used to measure the water vapour pressure. This is done by inserting the probe into the interior of the container via the sealable hole in the container's lid and measuring the water vapour pressure of the head space. These measurements are made at 10 minute intervals until the water vapour pressure has equilibrated. The probe then automatically converts the water vapour pressure reading into an equilibrium relative humidity value.</p><p num="p0019">Preferably, the composition upon contact with water at a concentration of 9.2g/l and at a temperature of 20°C forms a transparent wash liquor having (i) a turbidity of less than 500 nephelometric turbidity units; and (ii) a pH in the range of from 8 to 12. Preferably, the resultant wash liquor has a turbidity of less than 400, or less than 300, or from 10 to 300 nephelometric turbidity units. The turbidity of the wash liquor is typically measured using a H1 93703 microprocessor turbidity meter. A typical method for measuring the turbidity of the wash liquor is as follows: 9.2g of composition is added to 1 litre of water in a beaker to form a solution. The solution is stirred for 5 minutes at 600rpm at 20°C. The turbidity of the solution is then measured using a H1 93703 microprocessor turbidity meter following the manufacturer's instructions.</p><heading><u style="single">Alkyl benezene sulphonate</u></heading><p num="p0020">The composition comprises alkyl benzene sulphonate.
