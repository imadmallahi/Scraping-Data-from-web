flexible pavement surfacing in the U.S. is hot mix asphalt (HMA). Hot mix
asphalt is known by many different names such as hot mix, asphalt, or
blacktop. HMA consists of two basic ingredients: aggregate and asphalt
binder (bitumen).</p><p num="0002">Asphalt binders nowadays often comprise a mixture of bitumen and
polymer. Of these polymers, the thermoplastic rubbers forming a
continuous network are the most commonly used polymers, and have led to
various papers on the subject matter. In <b>GROS, William A., et al</b> The

instance, the effects of SB diblock copolymer on the complex shear
modulus and elasticity of a polymer-modified asphalt is described, with a
predicted lack of network participation for the SB diblock, accounting for
lower strength and greater temperature susceptibility of diblock-containing
systems. This article hence suggests a departure from diblock containing 
asphalt binders.</p><p num="0003">In <b>US 4196115</b> (PHILIPS) 01.04.1980 blends are described of different

aromatic copolymer having an Mw below 200,000 and being radial or linear,
with same conjugated diene/monovinyl aromatic weight ratios as earlier
given, in an asphalt-containing composition to yield desirable high as well
as low temperature properties. It is suggested that the high Mw copolymer
contributes to the high temperature stability, e.g., low or no flow between
25¬∞-100¬∞C and that the low Mw copolymer contributes to low temperature
flexibility, e.g., no cracking at -25¬∞C.</p><p num="0004">There are numerous examples of asphalt binders to be found in the patent

that a specific type of emulsion SBR can be used to modify asphalt cement
to greatly enhance the resistance to shoving, rutting and low temperature
cracking of asphalt concretes made therewith. The SBR used for asphalt
cement modification is a blend of (i) a high molecular weight
styrene-butadiene rubber having a weight average molecular weight of at
least about 300,000 and (ii) a low molecular weight styrene-butadiene
rubber having a weight average molecular weight of less than about
280,000; wherein the ratio of the high molecular weight styrene-butadiene
rubber to the low molecular weight styrene-butadiene rubber is within the
range of about 80:20 to about 25:75; and wherein the bound styrene
content of the high molecular weight styrene-butadiene rubber differs from
the bound styrene content of the low molecular weight styrene-butadiene 
rubber by at least 5 percentage points. It should be realized, however, that
SBR does not form continuous networks.</p><p num="0013">HMA's are made by heating and blending the aggregate and asphalt binder,
e.g., in a batch plant or a drum mix plant. During mixing, the hot asphalt
binder must be readily able to coat the dried and heated mineral aggregate,
given the shearing conditions employed, in a relatively short period of time
(typically 30 to 90 seconds). Whilst the mixing temperature must be
sufficiently high to allow rapid distribution of the asphalt binder on the
aggregate, the use of the lowest temperature possible is advocated to avoid
excessive oxidation of the bitumen. There are therefore upper and lower
limits to mixing temperature. The material so produced is generally stored
in silos before being discharged into trucks. So called "gap graded" HMA's
commonly suffer from drainage or drain-down, a process in which the
excess asphalt binder comes off the aggregates during storage or
transport.</p><p num="0014">Until about 20 years ago asphalt mixes were dense and often had a
continuous grading of aggregate to reduce the voids volume. Asphalt binder
content was optimised to get the right balance of properties. This generally
avoided the issue of drain-down or drainage of the asphalt binder. Also,
adding filler helped avoiding the issue of drainage.</p><p num="0015">More recently, however, mixes have been developed that consist of a rather
different aggregate grading. Some contain more voids deliberately for 
reasons of water drainage in service and noise reduction, while others are
dense but gap-graded (no continuity in the aggregate grading). Examples of
such gap-graded mixes are porous asphalt, based on so-called
"open-graded" aggregate; stone mastic asphalt or stone matrix asphalt
(SMA) based on so-called "gap-graded" material, and also (ultra) thin
overlays are based on this concept. The gap-graded aggregate mixture
provides a stable stone-to-stone skeleton, and through aggregate interlock
and particle friction give the structure its stability. These HMA's are more
prone to drain-down for reasons described below.</p><p num="0016">The present inventors set out to solve the problem of drain-down, without
adversely affecting the processability of the HMA, while improving its
performance in service</p><p num="0017">The maximum binder content of these open and gap graded mixes at which
no drainage will take place is typically lower than what is desirable in use.
For instance in porous asphalt the maximum would be at 3 to 3.5% by
weight of asphalt binder. However, with their open structure this would
result in excessive hardening of the binder and hence early brittle failure. It
is desirable to increase the thickness of the binder films by increasing the
asphalt binder content, which then leads to binder drainage during storage
and transport. SMAs are mixes that are basically similar to porous asphalt,
but instead of having excessive air voids, the voids are filled with mortar of
asphalt binder, filler, sand and small aggregate. In these mixes too, storage 
and transport will lead to binder drainage if no counter measures are taken.</p><p num="0018">There are several ways to reduce or inhibit drainage. One way is to add
fibres. Fibres can provide an excellent resistance to binder drainage, but do
not contribute much to the overall performance of the mix.</p><p num="0019">Finally, the addition of polymers to the bitumen may reduce the drainage
due to their increase in viscosity of the binder so-produced. However, there
is obviously a limit to the amount of polymer, as it will not only reduce
drainage, but will also make it more difficult to mix, lay and compact the
mix.</p><p num="0020">The present inventors therefore set out to find an asphalt binder that does
not suffer from drain-down, whilst maintaining processability at all stages of
blending, mixing, laying and compaction using standard available
equipment.</p><heading><b>Disclosure of Invention"</b></heading><p num="0021">Accordingly, an asphalt binder comprising 85 to 98.5 parts by weight of a

gap-graded or dense gap-aggregate material.</p><p num="0023">Furthermore, a pavement is claimed, produced from the open or gap-graded
mixes, by compacting the hot mix asphalt mentioned above.</p><heading><b>Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention</b></heading><p num="0024">The modification of bitumen by the addition of various polymers and
elastomers is known. Such elastomers include polybutadiene, polyisoprene, 
conjugated diene copolymers, natural rubber, butyl rubber, chloroprene,
random styrene-butadiene rubber, and styrene-butadiene diblock
copolymers. In addition bitumen's have been modified with a special class
of elastomers, so-called thermoplastic elastomers, which derive their
strength and elasticity from a physical cross-linking of the molecules into
three-dimensional networks. Of the four main groups of thermoplastic
elastomers, polyurethane, polyether-polyester copolymers, olefinic
copolymers and styrenic block copolymer, the latter have proved to be the
thermoplastic elastomer with the greatest potential when blended with
bitumen.</p><p num="0025">The present invention realizes sufficient processability of the asphalt binder
at the mixing stage, with little or no drainage of the asphalt binder at the
storage or transport stage and with sufficient workability at the compacting
stage.</p><p num="0026">Whilst achieving the aforementioned properties will greatly improve the
future of open or porous asphalt for road construction, ideally these
achievements should be obtained without adversely effecting or preferably
even improving the properties of the final pavement. Thus, the softening
point of the asphalt binder has been found to be important too. The present
invention solves these problems by using a polymer composition
comprising a high molecular weight styrenic block copolymer combined with
a low molecular weight elastomer. </p><p num="0027">Preferably, the styrenic block copolymer has a molecular weight in the

whereas in terms of the block B the expression "substantially" means that
sufficient conjugated diene is used, for instance at least 70% by weight, to
provide an elastomer block having a glass transition temperature below
25¬∞C.</p><p num="0031">The content of the vinyl aromatic compound in the styrenic block copolymer
is from 10 to 50% by weight, preferably from 15 to 40% by weight.</p><p num="0032">The vinyl aromatic compound may be selected from compounds having 8 to
18 carbon atoms per molecule. For instance, some representative
examples thereof include: styrene; 1-vinylnaphthalene; 3-methylstyrene;
3,5-diethylstyrene; 4-propylstyrene; 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene;
4-dodecylstyrene; 3-methyl,5-n-hexylstyrene; 4-phenylstyrene;
2-ethyl,4-benzylstyrene; 2,3,4,5-tetraethylstyrene;
3-ethyl-1-vinylnaphthalene; alpha-methylstyrene, and the like. Preferred
examples comprise 3-methylstyrene, styrene and mixtures thereof, styrene
being most preferred. Compounds that may be copolymerized and form
part of the A block(s) may be selected from the conjugated dienes
hereafter, and other anionically polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated
compounds, such as vinylcyclohexane, methylmethacrylate and the like.
Most preferably each polymer block A is a polystyrene block.</p><p num="0033">Block B is preferably made from butadiene, isoprene or mixtures thereof.
Conjugated dienes that can be used, preferably having from 4 to 12 carbon 
atoms per molecule, further include 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, piperylene,
3-butyl-1,3-octadiene, phenyl-1,3-butadiene, and the like. Said block(s) may
also comprise other monomers, such as the vinyl aromatic compounds
mentioned herein above. Most preferably block B is a polybutadiene block.</p><p num="0034">As is known, butadiene (and other conjugated dienes) may polymerize in
1,4-addition manner and/or 1,2-addition manner. The latter results in
pending vinyl groups. It is known in the art to use styrenic block copolymers
having relatively high vinyl content, e.g. up to 70% and higher (based on
the conjugated diene), e.g. by polymerizing the conjugated diene monomer
in the presence of a polar cosolvent and/or at a relatively cool
polymerization temperature. In producing the polymer block (B) under
ordinary conditions a vinyl content of less than 25% is obtained. Both high
vinyl and ordinary styrenic block copolymers may be used.</p><p num="0035">Styrenic block copolymer and elastomer may be used in relative amounts of
15 to 70% by weight (SBC1 and/or SBC2) and 85 to 30% by weight (EI),
respectively, but preferably in relative amounts 20 to 50% by weight (SBC1
and/or SBC2) and 80 to 50% by weight (EI). Most preferably, the relative
amounts are selected within the aforementioned range on the basis of
some scouting experiments, to compensate for the effect of the molecular
weights of these components and the effect of the bitumen.</p><p num="0036">Depending on their method of preparation these SBC's are known to
comprise diblock copolymers of formula A-B in various amounts. Indeed, in 
coupling reactions, the diblock copolymers of formula A-B have the same
molecular weight of the arms in the coupled polymer.</p><p num="0037">The co-produced diblock copolymer of formula A-B may be the low
molecular weight elastomer (EI) component of the polymer composition,
provided it has a molecular weight in the range of from 10,000 to 250.000
and is present in an amount in the range of 85 to 30% by weight basis the
polymer composition. This is the preferred embodiment. On the other hand,
elastomer (EI) may be a separate elastomer, selected from the elastomers
mentioned herein before. Elastomer (EI) may also be a diblock copolymer
produced independent of the preparation of the styrenic block copolymer
(A).</p><p num="0038">The polymer composition that has been found to be most suitable for the
present application is a high mol weight styrene-butadiene-styrene coupled
block copolymer with a large amount of di-block, with the following
characteristics:

styrene content in the range of 25-40%, preferably about 30% by weight:

diblock molecular weight 180,000-215,000, preferably about 200,000:
<sl><li>diblock content 75-85%, preferably 80% by weight (which corresponds with
a coupling efficiency of 15-25, preferably 20%);</li><li>having a linear structure (manufactured with a difunctional coupling agent),
having an apparent MW (SBS) of
30,000-40,000//300,000-350,000//30,000-40,000, preferably 36000 - 
328000 - 36000.</li></sl></p><p num="0039">This polymer composition is believed to be novel and is therefore claimed
herein as well, as is its use in other applications.</p><p num="0040">With the term "apparent molecular weight", as used throughout the present
specification, is meant the molecular weight, as measured by means of Gel
Permeation Chromatography (GPC), relative to commercially available
poly(styrene) calibration standards (according to ASTM D6474-99).</p><p num="0041">The asphalt component may be naturally occurring bitumen or derived from
a mineral oil. Also petroleum derivatives obtained by a cracking process,
pitch and coal tar can be used as the asphalt components, as well as the
blends of various asphalt materials. Examples of suitable components
include distillation or "straight-run" bitumens, precipitation bitumens, e.g.,
propane bitumens, blown bitumens and mixtures thereof. Other suitable
bitumens include mixtures of one or more of these bitumens with extenders
such as petroleum extracts, e.g. aromatic extracts, distillates or residues, or
with oils. Some representative examples of bitumens that may be used in
the present invention have a PEN value of below about 300 as measured
by ASTM Method D5.</p><p num="0042">For Hot Mix Asphalt compositions the preferred ranges are 3 to 8 parts on
97 to 92 parts of aggregate, more preferably from 4 to 8 parts on 96 to 92
parts of aggregate (parts by weight). </p><p num="0043">The aggregate materials basically comprise inert granular materials such as
rocks, stones, crushed stones, gravel, sand and filler. Aggregate material is
used in different sizes from rather small to relatively course, e.g., less than
0.075 mm ‚äò, and up to 40 mm ‚äò, and is available in all sizes between the
given boundaries. The aggregate composition is then chosen so that it
fulfils mechanical/structural requirements, which can either be a continuous
grading or gap-grading.</p><p num="0044">Aggregates can either be natural or manufactured. Natural gravel and sand
are usually dug or dredged from a pit, river, lake, or seabed. Crushed
aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or
large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate, as is
the use of industrial by-products such as slag (by-product of metallurgical
processing). Aggregate processing consists of crushing, screening, and
washing the aggregate to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation. If
necessary, a benefaction process such as jigging or heavy media
separation can be used to upgrade the quality. Once processed, the
aggregates are handled and stored in a way that minimizes segregation
and degradation and prevents contamination. Aggregates strongly influence
the properties of a HMA composition, mixture proportions, and economy.
Consequently, selection of aggregates is an important process. Although
some variation in aggregate properties is expected, characteristics that are
considered when selecting aggregate include:
 
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉgrading; durability; particle shape and surface texture; abrasion and
skid resistance; unit weights and voids; and absorption and surface
moisture.</p><p num="0045">Grading refers to the determination of the particle-size distribution for
aggregate. Grading limits and maximum aggregate size are specified
because grading and size affect the amount of aggregate used as well as
workability and durability of hot mix asphalt.</p><p num="0046">The selection of aggregate size can be such that the voids left by the
coarsest particles are filled by smaller particles. The voids between the
smaller particles are yet again filled by even smaller particles and so on. In
this case the grading is called continuous. The selection can also be such
that a certain particle size is left out. In this case the aggregate material is
referred to as a gap-graded mix.</p><p num="0047">In the below table, examples are given of some standard aggregate
materials. In the left hand column the diameter of the sieve size is given.
Thus, using a sieve having 11.2 mm size holes only some 0-6 parts by
weight of aggregate material is retained. In case of a sieve having 63 mu
size holes, nearly all aggregate material is retained. What is obvious from
these examples is that the distribution in continuous graded aggregate is
roughly equal, whereas such is not the case in open gap-graded and dense
gap-graded aggregates. <tables><table><tgroup cols="4"><tbody><row><entry align="left"><b>sieve size ‚ñ°</b></entry><entry align="center"><b>continuous graded</b></entry><entry align="center"><b>Open gap-graded</b></entry><entry align="center"><b>Dense gap-graded</b></entry></row><row><entry align="right">C11,2mm</entry><entry align="center">0-6</entry><entry align="center">0-5</entry><entry align="center">0-8</entry></row><row><entry align="right">C8 mm</entry><entry align="center">5-25</entry><entry align="center">60-85</entry><entry align="center">40-55</entry></row><row><entry align="right">C5,6 mm</entry><entry align="center">25-50</entry><entry align="center">80-85</entry><entry align="center">60-75</entry></row><row><entry align="right">2 mm</entry><entry align="center">52-58</entry><entry align="center">85</entry><entry align="center">72.2-82.5</entry></row><row><entry align="right">63 mu</entry><entry align="center">92.5-94</entry><entry align="center">95.5</entry><entry align="center">90-94</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p num="0048">Other components that may be used include fillers and reinforcing agents
such as ground tires, silica, talc, calcium carbonate, mineral matter powder,
and fibres (glass, cellulose, acryl, and rock); curing agents such as sulphur
and sulphur compounds; pigments; softening agents such as paraffinic,
naphthenic or aromatic oils; tackiness imparting resins; foaming agents;
and stiffeners such as waxes and low molecular weight polyolefins.</p><p num="0049">In addition to the binder composition and the new polymer composition, the
present invention also concerns pavements and overlays based on the
asphalt binder described above.</p><p num="0050">In addition to gap graded asphalt, the new polymer composition and the
binder may be used in crack filler applications, where the polymer offers the
elasticity and softness desired for crack filler; in self adhered membranes,
and in high efficiency crosslinked product for paving. They may also be 
used in shingles and roofing felts, carpet backing and sound deadening, as
well as in coatings based on polymer modified bitumen.</p><p num="0051">The new polymer composition may also find other end-uses. For instance it
may be used in blends with thermoplastic polymers to improve the impact
resistance of the polymer systems. Thermoplastics in particular are
polystyrene and polyphenylene oxide, and
poly(styrene-methylmethacrylate), and high impact polystyrene. Inclusion of
the new polymer composition will improve toughness of these polymer
systems. Also, the polymer composition can be used in sheet moulding
compounds together with unsaturated polyester, styrene monomer, fillers,
glass fibre, and peroxide crosslinker. The advantage of using the new
polymer composition is to provide good shrink control of the sheet moulding
compounds. The polymer composition and blends thereof may also find use
in adhesive, sealant and coating compositions, in oil gels (e.g., as cable
filling component) and in footwear.</p><p num="0052">The present invention will hereinafter be illustrated more specifically by the
