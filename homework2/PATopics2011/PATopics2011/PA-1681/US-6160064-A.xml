The activity of fluxional unbridged metallocene polymerization catalysts containing at least one 2-arylindene ligand is increased 10 0.1-10 wt. %) amounts of ethylene to the polymerization system, which increase is termed the Polymerization Rate-Enhancement effect (PRE), which is measured in terms of an Ethylene Enhancement Factor (EEF) as a dimensionless ratio in the range of from about 1.1 to about 10 or above.

More specifically, the invention is directed to: (1) the discovery and catalytic process use of a Polymerization Rate-Enhancement effect (PRE effect) in polymerization processes which involve the addition of minor amounts of ethylene to the polymerization system to produce polymers having properties ranging from crystalline thermoplastics to high melting point thermoplastic elastomers to amorphous gum elastomers, and methods for increasing polymerization production rates and polymer molecular weight; (2) the discovery and catalytic process use of an Elastomeric Property-Enhancement effect (EPE effect) in which small quantities of ethylene added to the polymerization system activates selected metallocene catalyst systems, which otherwise do not produce elastomeric polymers, to produce elastomeric polymers; and (3) novel substituted aryl indenyl metallocene catalysts.</p><heading>BACKGROUND</heading><p>Crystalline, amorphous, and elastic polypropylenes are known. Crystalline polypropylenes are generally regarded as comprising predominantly isotactic or syndiotactic structures and amorphous polypropylene is regarded as comprising predominantly of an atactic structure. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,112,300 and 3,112,301 both of Natta, et. al. describes isotactic and prevailingly isotactic polypropylene.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 3,175,199 to Natta et al. describes an elastomeric polypropylene which can be fractioned out of a polymer mixture containing prevailingly isotactic and atactic polypropylenes When separated from the polymer mixture, a fraction of this polymer showed elastomeric properties which were attributed to a stereoblock structure comprising alternating blocks of isotactic and atactic stereosequences. U.S. Pat. No. 4,335,225 discloses a fractionable elastomeric polypropylene with a broad molecular weight distribution.</p><p>Elastomeric polypropylenes with narrow molecular weight distributions are also known which are produced in the presence of bridged metallocene catalysts. Polymers of this type were described by Chien et. al. in (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 8569-8570), but their low melting point renders them unsuitable for certain applications. In addition, the activities of these catalyst systems are low.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,080 discloses an unbridged, fluxional metallocene catalyst system useful for the production of elastomeric polyolefins. These fluxional, unbridged catalysts can interconvert between geometric states on the time scale of the growth of a single polymer chain in order to produce isotactic, atactic stereoblock polyalphaolefins with useful elastomeric properties. Polyolefins produced with these fluxional catalysts systems can have a range of properties, from amorphous gum elastomers to useful thermoplastic elastomers to non-elastomeric thermoplastics.</p><p>The commercial utility of a catalyst system is closely tied to the polymerization activity. Processes that lead to an increase in activity of a polymerization system are of considerable practical utility. The activity of a polymerization system can in some cases be influenced by additives to the polymerization system. For example for both classical Ziegler-Natta systems as well as metallocene systems, the addition of hydrogen can result in an increase in propylene polymerization activity, see Pasquet, V., et al., Makromol. Chem. 1993, 194, 451-461 and references cited therein. One of the explanations for the hydrogen effect is the reactivation of the dormant sites resulting from 2,1-propylene misinsertions, see Corradini, P., et al., Makromol. Chem., Rapid Commun. 1992, 13, 15-20; Corradini, P., et al., Makromol. Chem., Rapid Commun. 1992, 13, 21-24; and Busico, V., et al., Makromol. Chem., Rapid Commun. 1993, 14, 97-103. Since hydrogen is also a chain transfer agent, the addition of hydrogen decreases the molecular weight, which limits the practical utility of the hydrogen effect where high molecular weight polymers are desired.</p><p>Activation of ethylene polymerization systems by the addition of small amounts of an alpha olefin is also known, see for example Brintzinger, H., et. al. Angew. Chemie, Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1143-1170. This so-called "comonomer effect" (see Spitz, R., et al. Makromol. Chem. 1988, 189, 1043-1050) is useful in a process for the synthesis of ethylene polymers, but not for alpha olefin polymers. Hefert, N., et. al. Makromol. Chem. 1993 194, 3167-3182 report no effect of hexene on the rate of propene polymerization with a metallocene catalyst. Several explanations have been forwarded to explain this "comonomer effect" including a "trigger mechanism" (Ystenes, M., Makromol. Chem. "Macromolecular Symposia" 1993, 66, 71-81) and improved rates of diffusion due to the solubilization of active centers by incorporation of comonomer (see Koivumaki, J., et al. Macromolecules 1993, 26, 5535-5538).</p><p>Activation of propylene polymerization systems in the presence of 5% ethylene have been previously reported for magnesium chloride supported Ti-based catalysts by Spitz, R., et al. in Makromol. Chem. 1988, 189, 1043-1050 and in Spitz, R., et al. in "Transition Metal Catalyzed Polymerization", Quirk, R. P., Ed., Cambridge Univ. Press 1988, pp. 719-728, and with V-based Ziegler catalysts by Valvassori, A., et al. in Makromol. Chem. 1963, 61, 46-62. While such "synergistic effects" have been observed with classical Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems, Koivumaki et. al. point out that such synergistic effects do not work for homogeneous metallocene systems (see Koivumaki, J., et al. Macromolecules 1993, 26, 5535-5538).</p><p>Accordingly, there is a need for processes to improve the activity of metallocene catalysts systems capable of producing elastomeric polypropylenes of high molecular weight with high melting points.</p><heading>THE INVENTION</heading><heading>SUMMARY, OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES</heading><p>We have discovered that the activity of fluxional unbridged metallocene polymerization catalysts containing at least one 2-arylindene ligand may be increased by the addition of small (typically 0.1-10 wt. %) amounts of ethylene to the polymerization system. In particular, the addition of ethylene to a propylene polymerization system derived from unbridged metallocene catalysts containing at least one 2-arylindene ligand results in a significant increase (up to ten-fold or above) in catalyst activity. We term this increase in activity the Polymerization Rate Enhancement effect (PRE), which can be measured in terms of an Ethylene Enhancement Factor (EEF) as a dimensionless ratio. Also, the molecular weight of the produced polymers may increase in the presence of ethylene. The amount of ethylene included in the reaction system can be selected and controlled to be so small as to result in essentially minimal (&amp;lt;2 mole %) incorporation of ethylene units into the polymer, yet surprisingly results in a significant, disproportionately large increase in polymerization activity. More specifically, by addition of small amounts of ethylene into polypropylene reaction systems, an unexpectedly large (order of magnitude or more) increase in activity is achieved to produce elastomeric products.</p><p>Thus, in a first aspect of this invention, elastomeric olefin polymers are formed using unbridged fluxional, metallocene-based, catalyst systems in a polymerization process in which an activity-enhancing amount of ethylene is incorporated into the polymerization feed. This effect is herein termed the PRE effect, for Polymerization Rate-Enhancement effect, and is quantified as a dimensionless number in the range of from about 1.1 to about 10 or above, called the EEF for Ethylene Enhancement Factor. Typically, useful PRE (activity-enhancing) amounts of ethylene are above about 0.1 wt. % in the feed. Amounts of ethylene to generate the PRE effect may be greater than 0.5 wt. % and preferably range up to about 2 wt. %. However, if a polymer with more ethylene is desired, additional ethylene may be incorporated into the polymerization feed, including up to 10 to about 50 mole % based on olefin units.</p><p>Even though ethylene may be introduced into a polymer of this invention, only an activity-enhancing amount of ethylene for PRE is required, i.e., to increase the activity of the fluxional, metallocene-based, catalyst. Thus, a second important aspect of this invention is the ability to use a PRE activity-enhancing amount of ethylene in an olefin polymerization without substantially affecting the physical properties of the elastomer. Preferred elastomeric polymers containing ethylene linkages made according to this invention have high melting temperatures (as measured by DSC) above 80 range of from about 120</p><p>In a third important aspect of this invention, we have discovered the ability to produce olefin (preferably propylene) elastomers through incorporation of ethylene using unbridged fluxional catalyst systems which may not otherwise produce acceptable elastomeric homopolymers. This effect is herein termed the EPE effect, for Elastomeric Property-Enhancing effect. The Elastomeric Property-Enhancing amount of ethylene required to produce such elastomers typically overlaps the aforesaid PRE activity-enhancing amount. Incorporation of up to about 5 mole % or more of ethylene typically will produce an elastomeric polymer using such catalyst systems. Typical useful amounts of incorporated ethylene include about 1 to 3 mole %. Again, a preferred polymer of this invention retains sufficient crystallinity to provide a high melting point (by DSC) of above 80 from about 120 the novel Catalyst D of this invention bis [2-(3,5-trifluoromethylphenyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride produces an elastomeric polypropylene with 9% ethylene incorporated in the polymer with a T.sub.m of 100 about 10 mole % or more, polymers of this invention typically show melting temperatures of 80 propylene-ethylene copolymer elastomers produced by conventional catalysts which have a lower melting temperature.</p><p>Polymers of this invention show a broad melting range by DSC analysis and exhibit good elastic recoveries. The conventional measurement of the melting point (T.sub.m) is the peak (or inverse peak) in the DSC curve. Polymers of this invention also typically retain properties after thermocycling of up to 100 polymers retain transparency after such a heat treatment and do not become opaque.</p><p>A preferred elastomeric Î±-olefin polymer of this invention is a propylene polymer in which an amount of ethylene is incorporated during polymerization such that the resulting elastomeric propylene polymer maintains sufficient physical properties at elevated temperature (such as melting temperature) to permit steam sterilization without deformation of a shaped article fabricated from the polymer. Typical steam sterilization conditions are maintenance of a temperature of 121 a 2 atmosphere steam pressure.</p><p>Further, in polymerization systems which produce thermoplastic crystalline propylene polymers, introduction of ethylene merely reduces the melting point. In contrast, the EPE effect of this invention unexpectedly results in converting the polymers to true elastomers while providing a method of control over melting point and retention of properties after thermocycling by adjustment of the ethylene content in the feed and end product polymers.</p><p>As noted above, the class of metallocenes of this invention is defined as "fluxional", meaning that the geometry of such metallocene can change between two isomeric states. This change in configuration occurs on a time scale that is slower than the rate of olefin insertion, but faster than the average time to construct (polymerize) a single polymer chain. The fluxional catalyst structure is such that upon isomerization the catalyst symmetry alternates between states that have different coordination geometries and thus different steroselectivities. The catalyst remains in that geometric symmetry for a time sufficient to be characterizable as a "state", before rotating or otherwise transforming to the other geometry or state. This geometric or state alternation can be controlled by selecting ligand type and structure to control rotation of the ligands on the ligand-metal bond. Further, through control of polymerization, precise control of the physical properties of the resulting polymers can be achieved.</p><p>This invention includes novel processes for tailoring block size distribution and resulting properties of the polymer such as: tacticity, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, productivity, melt flow rate, melting point, crystallite aspect ratio, tensile set and tensile strength by varying the structure of the catalyst, the conditions of the polymerization reaction, and the solvents, reactants, additives and adjuvants employed, the latter adjuvants including use of ethylene in the PRE and EPE effect processes described above and in the examples.</p><p>The catalyst system of the present invention consists of the transition metal component metallocene in the presence of an appropriate cocatalyst.

Various agents can be added to control the molecular weight, including hydrogen, silanes and metal alkyls such as diethylzinc.</p><p>The metallocenes of the present invention, in the presence of appropriate cocatalysts, are useful for the homo-polymerization (and co-polymerization) of alpha-olefins, such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and combinations thereof, and of copolymerization with ethylene. The polymerization of olefins is carried out by contacting the olefin(s) with the catalyst systems comprising the transition metal component and in the presence of an appropriate cocatalyst, such as an aluminoxane, or a Lewis acid such as B(C.sub.6 F.sub.5).sub.3. In co-monomer systems, and in particular ethylene-propylene monomer systems, productivities in excess of 41 kg/g for the copolymerizations has been attained [see Example 85].</p><p>The metallocene catalyst systems of the present invention are particularly useful for the polymerization of propylene monomers and propylene-ethylene monomer mixtures to produce polypropylenes and propylene-ethylene co-polymers with novel elastomeric properties. By elastomeric, we mean a material which tends to regain its shape upon extension, such as one which exhibits a positive power of recovery at 100%, 200% and 300% elongation. The properties of elastomers are characterized by several variables. The tensile set (TS) is the elongation remaining in a polymer sample after it is stretched to an arbitary elongation (e.g. 100% or 300%) and allowed to recover. Lower set indicates higher elongational recovery. Stress relaxation is measured as the decrease in stress (or force) during a time period (e.g. 30 sec. or 5 min.) that the specimen is held at extension. There are various methods for reporting hysteresis during repeated extensions. In the present application, retained force is measured as the ratio of stress at 50% elongation during the second cycle recovery to the initial stress at 100% elongation during the same cycle. Higher values of retained force and lower values of stress relaxation indicate stronger recovery force. Better general elastomeric recovery properties are indicated by low set, high retained force and low stress relaxation.</p><p>It is believed that the elastomeric properties of the polypropylenes and propylene-ethylene copolymers of this invention are due to an alternating block structure comprising of isotactic and atactic stereo-sequences. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that isotactic block stereosequences tightly interlocked with one another provide crystalline blocks which can act as physical crosslinks in the polymer network. These crystalline blocks are separated from one another by intermediate, atactic lengths of the polymer which enable the polymer to elastically deform. While we do not wish to be bound by theory it is believed the ethylene is incorporated randomly between the propylene units in the chain.</p><p>The structure of the polymers may be described in terms of the isotactic pentad content [mmmm] which is the percentage of isotactic stereosequences of 5 contiguous stereocenters, as determined by .sup.13 C NMR spectroscopy (Zambelli, A., et al. "Model Compounds and .sup.13 C NMR Observation of Stereosequences of Polypropylene" Macromolecules 1975, 8, 687-689). The isotactic pentad content of statistically atactic polypropylene is approximately 6.25%, while that of highly isotactic poly-propylene can approach 100%. For co-polymers the isotactic pentad content may be defined as the ratio of the area of PmPmPmPmPm+PmPmPmPmPE peaks over the area of all methyl peaks.</p><p>While it is possible to produce propylene homopolymers and copolymers with ethylene having a range of isotactic pentad contents, the elastomeric properties of the polymer will depend on the distribution of isotactic (crystalline) and atactic (amorphous) stereosequences, as well as the distribution of comonomer in the copolymer. Semicrystalline thermoplastic elastomers of the present class of materials consist of amorphous-crystalline block polymers, and thus the blockiness of the polymer determines whether it will be elastomeric. Crystallizable isotactic block length and content must be sufficient to provide a crosslinked network with usefully high Tm, but below the crystallinity of a hard plastic.</p><p>We have discovered that the structure, and therefore the properties of the alpha olefin polymers obtained with the catalysts of the present invention are dependent on olefin concentration, the ratio of olefins in the feed, the nature of the ligands, reactant pressure, the temperature of the polymerization, the nature of the transition metal, the ligands on the metallocene, the nature of the cocatalyst, and the reaction system.</p><p>It will be appreciated from the illustrative examples that the catalyst systems of this invention provide a broad range of polymer properties from the polymerization process of this invention. Polymers which range in properties from non-elastomeric thermoplastics to thermoplastic elastomers can be readily obtained by suitable manipulation of the metallocene catalyst, the reaction conditions, or the cocatalyst to give all by proper choice of process conditions and catalyst.</p><p>Without being bound by theory, it is believed that it is critical for the present invention to have a catalyst which can isomerize between states on a time scale that is slower than the rate of olefin insertion but faster than the average time to construct a single polymer chain in order to obtain a block structure. In addition, to produce elastomeric polymers, the catalyst complex isomerizes between states which have different coordination geometries. This is provided in the present invention by metallocene catalysts comprising of unbridged cyclopentadienyl-based ligands which are substituted in such a way that they can exist in different geometric states during the course of the polymerization reaction.</p><p>Based on the evidence to date, it appears that the rotation of the cyclopentadienyl ligands provides a mechanism for the alternation of catalyst geometry between the two states. The average block size distribution for a polymer produced with a catalyst which can change its state is controlled by the relative rate of polymerization versus catalyst isomerization as well as the steady-state equilibrium constant for the various coordination geometries (e.g. chiral vs. achiral). The catalysts of this invention provide a means of producing polypropylenes and other alpha olefins with a wide range of isotactic and atactic block lengths by changing the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands of the metallocene. It is believed that modification of the cyclopentadienyl ligands and/or the nature of the transition metal will alter one or more of the following: The rate of polymerization, the rate of catalyst isomerization, and the steady-state equilibrium constant between the various coordination geometries, all of which will affect the block lengths and block length distribution in the resulting polymer. For example, it is believed that introduction of larger substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands will slow the rate of rotation and thereby increase the block lengths in the polymer. Of particular interest is the ability to produce high melting thermoplastic elastomers from catalysts which normally produce only non-elastomeric thermoplastics by the incorporation of small amounts of a second olefin. The comonomer is believed to insert randomly into the isotactic and atactic blocks, thereby disrupting crystallinity, but still providing a thermoplastic elastomer network (i.e. alternating stereoblock structure) with sufficient isotactic block lengths to achieve high melting polymers.</p><p>As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,594,080, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, fluxional catalysts of the type described herein are useful for the production of elastomeric polyolefins. The productivity of catalyst systems has a large influence on their commercial viability; we have found that addition of small amounts of ethylene to a reaction system useful for the preparation of polyolefin elastomers has a quite unexpected and beneficial effect of increasing the productivity of the reaction system dramatically. It is known that most polymerization catalysts are more active for ethylene polymerization than alpha olefin polymerization, thus a somewhat higher productivity might be expected for a polymerization system containing both ethylene and an alpha olefin. However, the disproportionately large and unexpected increase in productivity of the catalysts systems of the present invention in the presence of as little as 0.6 weight percent ethylene in the reaction system is not predictable from prior works, and is evidence for the non-linear increase in productivity which we term the "Polymerization Rate-Enhancement effect" (PRE effect), which is quantifiable in terms of an "Ethylene Enhancement Factor" or EEF. The ethylene enhancement factor EEF can be calculated from the well-known equations which describe the copolymerization of olefins. By way of illustration, we derive these equations for the effect of ethylene on propylene polymerization, but the Polymerization Rate-Enhancement effect will apply in the case of other alpha olefins as well.</p><p>The rate of olefin polymerization in the presence of two monomers such as ethylene and propylene can be described by 1st order Markov model given by the following four equations: ##EQU1## where M.sub.e and M.sub.p are the active centers with the last ethylene and propylene inserted units, respectively and k.sub.ee is the rate constant for ethylene insertion at an ethylene site M.sub.e, and k.sub.ep is the rate constant of propylene insertion at an ethylene site M.sub.e, etc . . . The rate of polymerization in the presence of both ethylene and propylene, R.sub.ep, can be expressed as:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->R.sub.ep =k.sub.ee [M.sub.e ][E]+k.sub.pe [M.sub.p ][E]+k.sub.ep [M.sub.e ][P]+k.sub.pp [M.sub.p ][P]</pre></p><p>Since, under steady-state conditions, the rates of interconversion of M.sub.e into M.sub.p and of M.sub.p into M.sub.e are equal:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->k.sub.pe [M.sub.p ][E]=k.sub.ep [M.sub.e ][P]</pre></p><p>and we can express [M.sub.e ] through [M.sub.p ] as:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->R.sub.ep =k.sub.ee (k.sub.pe /k.sub.ep)[M.sub.p ][E][E]/[P]+2k.sub.pe [M.sub.p ][E]+k.sub.pp [M.sub.p ][P].</pre></p><p>At low ethylene concentrations in the feed, where [p]=[p.sup.h ], the ratio of the rate of polymerization in the presence of both monomers, R.sub.ep, to the rate of propylene polymerization, R.sub.pp, is: ##EQU2## where k.sub.pp.sup.h, M.sub.p.sup.h, P.sup.h signify the values for propylene polymerization in the absence of ethylene, and k.sub.ee /k.sub.ep =r.sub.e and k.sub.pp /k.sub.pe =r.sub.p.</p><p>The ratio of the rates of polymerization in the presence and absence of ethylene are related to the ratio of the corresponding productivities, P.sub.ep and P.sub.pp : ##EQU3##</p><p>In equation 5 the increase of polymerization productivity due to the faster rate of ethylene 15 insertion is described by expression (r.sub.e [E].sup.2 /r.sub.p [P].sup.2 +2[E]/(r.sub.p [P])+1). The expression k.sub.pp [M.sub.p ]/k.sub.pp.sup.h [M.sub.p.sup.h ] is the Ethylene Enhancement Factor (EEF) and describes the ratio of the rate of consecutive propylene-propylene insertions in the presence of ethylene as compared to the rate in the absence of ethylene: ##EQU4## If there is no ethylene enhancement effect, then the EEF should be equal to unity, that is EEF=k.sub.pp [M.sub.p ]/(k.sub.pp.sup.h [M.sub.p.sup.h ])=1. An EEF greater than one is a metric that signifies an unexpected and non-linear increase in productivity in the presence of ethylene that cannot be anticipated due to the greater rate of ethylene insertion relative to that of alpha olefins.</p><p>For the catalysts of the present invention, we find dramatic and non-linear increases in productivities of alpha olefins in the presence of minor amounts of ethylene. Catalyst systems containing as little as 0.6% by weight of ethylene in the feed result in more than a two-fold increase in productivity (EEF=2.2) to give elastomeric polyolefins. In another example, as little as 5 wt. % ethylene in the feed results a 10-fold increase in productivity to give useful elastomeric products. Thus, one of the benefits of the Polymerization Rate-Enhancement effect (PRE effect) of this invention is that catalyst systems which in the absence of ethylene might be of marginal or little commercial interest are useful for the production of elastomeric polymers.</p><p>By using the novel metallocene catalyst systems of the invention without ethylene, we obtain polymers which range in properties from non-elastomeric thermoplastics to useful elastomeric Î±-olefin polymers. By use of ethylene as described herein to take advantage of the Polymerization Rate-Enhancement effect, elastomeric Î±-olefin polymers may be obtained, but at rates up to ten fold greater than the use of the same catalyst systems without the ethylene.</p><p>Furthermore, by use of the novel metallocene catalysts of the present invention we obtain alpha olefin (preferably propylene) elastomers by adding ethylene to an unbridged fluxional metallocene polymerization system which may not otherwise produce useful elastomeric homopolymers. By use of certain metallocene catalysts of the present invention, a remarkable improvement in the properties of propylene homopolymers can be realized by incorporation of small amounts of ethylene (10% or less). For example, polymerization of propylene with certain catalysts of the present invention can yield non-elastomeric propylene homopolymers with tensile sets above 39%, stress relaxation above 60% and no retained force. Incorporation of small amounts (10% or less) of ethylene into these polymerization system surprisingly results in polymers with good elastomeric properties. This is an example of the Elastomeric Property-Enhancement (EPE) effect.</p><p>The polymers of the present invention have useful elastomeric properties. These are a consequence the degree of crystallinity in the polymers which is controlled by the use of the catalysts and ethylene enhancement processes of this invention. The degree of crystallinity of the polymers of this invention are typically in the range of 1-40%, preferably in the range of 5-30% and most preferably in the range of 10-25%. The melting points of the polymers of the present invention are typically above 80 range of 120 polymers of the present invention exhibit tensile moduli in the range of 2-30 MPa, with values preferably below 20 MPa and most preferably below 15 MPa. The elastomeric polymers of the invention exhibit a positive force of recovery upon elongation. Typically, the retained force at 50% extension following 100% elongation is in the range of 10-50%, preferably in the range of 15-50%, and most preferably in the range 20-50%. The recovery properties of the polymers are also very good as evidenced by tensile set at 100% elongations of typically less than 50%, preferably less than 20% and most preferably less than 10%.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><?description-type Detailed Description?><p>The following detailed description illustrates the invention by way of example, not by way of limitation of the principles of the invention.

No. 5,594,080 and the novel catalysts disclosed herein and compares them to bridged catalysts.</p><p>General Procedures: Olefin Polymerization</p><p>Method A: Propylene Polymerization in Toluene. In a nitrogen filled drybox, a 300-mL stainless-steel Parr reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer was charged with dry methylaluminoxane (MAO Type 4 Akzo, dried&amp;gt;24h) dissolved in toluene. A 50-mL pressure tube was charged with the corresponding metallocene catalyst dissolved in 20 mL of toluene. The reactor was purged several times by pressurizing with propylene and venting. It was then brought to the appropriate pressure (until saturation) and temperature with stirring. The pressure tube containing the metallocene was pressurized to 200 psi with nitrogen. Once the MAO solution was saturated with propylene the catalyst solution was injected into the reactor at the appropriate temperature. After stirring for 1 hour, the polymerization was quenched by injecting methanol (10 mL). The autoclave was then slowly vented and opened. The polymer was precipitated by the addition of methanol (400 mL), collected by filtration, and dried overnight at ambient temperature.</p><p>Method B: Bulk Polymerization of Propylene. A 300-mL stainless steel Parr reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer was evacuated, purged 4-5 times with gaseous propylene by pressurizing and venting and charged with liquid propylene (100 mL). The monomer was equilibrated at the reaction temperature and the reaction was initiated by injecting the subject zirconocene/MAO solution in toluene (20 mL) under Ar pressure (250 psig, 1720 kPa). The reaction was run until a slight drop in pressure (1-2 psig, 7-14 kPa) was registered for 25-50 minutes and then quenched by injecting MeOH (20 mL). The reactor was slowly vented and opened. The polymer was precipitated in acidified MeOH (5% HCl), filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at 40</p><p>Method C: Ethylene Homopolymerization in Toluene Solution. A 300-mL stainless steel Parr reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer was charged with dry methylaluminoxane and toluene (80 mL). A 50-mL pressure tube was charged with the zirconocene solution in toluene (20 mL). The reactor was purged with ethylene 3-4 times by pressurizing and venting. The monomer was then equilibrated with the toluene in the reactor for 30 min at the polymerization temperature and pressure with constant stirring. The pressure tube with the metallocene solution was pressurized to 200 psig (1400 kPa) with argon and the solution was injected into the reactor. After 1 h the reaction was quenched by injecting methanol (20 mL). The reactor was slowly vented and opened. The polymer was collected by filtration and dried in a vacuum oven at 40</p><p>Method D: Propylene Polymerization in Toluene Solution in the Presence of Ethylene-(PRE effect). A 4-L stainless steel cylinder was filled with ethylene and propylene at a certain ratio measured from the partial pressures of the two gases. The gas mixture was heated to 100 for 20 hours to facilitate gas mixing. The mixture was used for 2 polymerizations and then the cylinder was refilled with a new mixture.</p><p>In a nitrogen filled drybox, a 300-mL stainless steel Parr reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer was charged with dry methylaluminoxane and 80 mL of toluene. A 50-mL pressure tube was charged with the zirconocene solution in toluene (20 mL). The reactor was purged 4-5 times with ethylene-propylene mixture by pressurizing and venting. The gas mixture was then equilibrated with the toluene in the reactor for 15 min at 15 psig (100 kPa) and 20 with the metallocene solution was pressurized to 200 psig (1400 kPa) with argon and the reaction was started by injecting the catalyst. The reaction was run for 15 minutes with constant stirring and was quenched by injecting 20 mL of methanol. The reactor was then slowly vented and opened. The polymer was precipitated in acidified MeOH (5% HCl), filtered, washed with MeOH and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 weight.</p><p>Method E: Polymerization in Liquid Propylene. A 300-mL stainless steel Parr reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer was evacuated, purged 4-5 times with gaseous propylene by pressurizing and venting and charged with liquid propylene (100 mL). Propylene was cooled down to the reaction temperature and overpressurized with ethylene to a certain pressure. The monomer mixture was equilibrated at the reaction temperature under constant ethylene pressure for at least 10 minutes. Immediately prior to the catalyst injection the ethylene line was disconnected and the reactor was cooled to 2-3 the exothermic effect upon initiation. Zirconocene/MAO solution in toluene (20 mL) was pressurized with Ar to approximately 120 psi above the total pressure in the reactor). In the case of polymerizations at 0-2 the catalyst was cooled down in an ice bath and then injected. In the case of polymerizations at 20 temperature was injected. The ethylene line was reconnected and the reaction was run for 15-60 min at constant total pressure and temperature. The reaction was quenched by injecting MeOH (20 mL), the reactor was slowly vented and opened. The polymer was precipitated in acidified MeOH (5% HCl), filtered, washed with MeOH and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 C to constant weight.</p><p>Method F: Polymerization in Liquid Propylene With Ethylene (PRE and EPE). To a 19 gallon (72 liter) reactor the following material is charged: 20.4 kg polymer grade propylene, 0.23 kg ethylene and 9.07 kg heptane after being passed over guard columns to remove moisture and dissolved oxygen. The reactor then is heated to 43.3.degree. C., while stirring. In a dry box, 0.09 gram of metallocene catalyst Q is dissolved in 50 grams of toluene and added to 40 grams of PMAO (10.6% Al), stirred and added to a hoke cylinder. Toluene (50 grams) is used to wash the reagent remnants from the glassware into the hoke cylinder. The catalyst/cocatalyst solution is aged for a total of 30 minutes before being added to the reactor. At reactor temperature of 43.3.degree. C., the catalyst is injected to initiate the polymerization. The termperature is allowed to increase to 48.9.degree. C. and maintained for 3 hours. During the polymerization, 45-gram aliquots of ethylene are added every 20 minutes for a total of 590 grams of ethylene (including the initial charge). The heat of reaction is removed by evaporative cooling as well as via a reactor cooling jacket. At the end of the 3 hours, the reactor pressure is reduced to atmospheric to rapidly flash unreacted propylene and ethylene. A make up solvent, such as heptane or toluene is added to redissolve the polymer. The polymer is recovered by methanol coagulation, washed and dried to yieled 12.9 lbs of copolymer product with MFR of 1.9 g/10 min., ethylene content of 8 mole %, and Mn=119,000, Mw=358,000, Mw/Mn=3.0 (by GPC analysis).</p><heading>III. Analytical Methods</heading><p>Molecular weight data are obtained on a Waters 150C GPC instrument at 139 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene as reference standards.</p><p>Isotacticity data for polypropylene was obtained from .sup.13 C NMR at 130 125 MHz, a Varian XL-400 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 100 MHz, or a Varian UI 300 (10 mm tubes) operating at 100 either as solutions of 0.25 g polymer in 2.6 mL dideuterotetrachloroethane, as 0.05 g polymer in 0.5 mL dideuterotetrachloroethane, or as a 10-12% w/w sample in 1,2,3,3-tetrachloroethane/10 vol.% 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2. Acquisition time of 1 second with no additional delay between pulses and continuous proton decoupling were used. Sample concentration was 10-12 weight percent. All spectra were referenced using the solvent peak. The areas of the peaks in the methyl region determined from the spectral integrations were used to determine the isotacticity of the polymer.</p><p>Isotacticity data for ethylene-propylene copolymers was determined from .sup.13 C NMR performed on a Varian UI 300 in a 10 mm switchable broad band probe at 140 a solvent using gated decoupling mode. Sample concentrations of 10-12 weight percent was used. Acquisition time was set to 1 second with additional 12 second delays between pulses. Spectra were referenced to benzene-d6 peak. Spectral integrations were used to determine the copolymer composition and monomer sequence distribution.</p><p>Thermal analysis was performed by DSC, using a TA/DuPont 2100 instrument, with nitrogen purge. Sample weight was about 13 mg. Heating rate was 20 endotherm temperature (Tm) and heat of fusion are typically reported from the second heat cycle. Heat of crystallization and temperature of crystallization are typically reported from the first cooling cycle.</p><p>Polymer Testing Methods</p><p>Mechanical property tests were conducted with stabilized samples in which commercial antioxidants were mixed at conventional amounts, as in the isotactic polypropylene art, before molding or extrusion. Ultranox 641 (at 0.09%), Ultranox 210 (at 0.09%) and DHT-4A (at 0.02%) were employed in this application.</p><p>Melt flow rates are determined using a Tinius Olsen Melt Flow Meter operating at 232 experiment, 5 grams of the polymer sample is mixed with 50 mg of BHT and this mixture added to the heating chamber. A 2.0 Kg mass is attached to a plunger inserted into the heating chamber and the melt flow is determined by measuring the quantity of material extruded over a period of 1 minute. Results are reported in units of decigrams polymer/minute of flow, or grams/10 min by ASTM method D1238.</p><p>Tensile, stress relaxation and hysteresis recovery/set tests were performed with ASTM D 1708 dumbell specimens (0.9 inch gauge length) die cut from extruded film or compression molded sheets. Crosshead separation rate was 25.4 cm/min for the hysteresis test and 51 cm/min. for the other tests.</p><p>Tensile Test: ASTM D 1708-95, ASTM D 638-96. Ultimate tensile strength (i.e. stress at break) is reported. Tensile modulus is the linear slope of the stress/strain plot at lowest elongation. In polyolefins modulus, like density, is a measure of crystallinity. Percent elongation to break is the ultimate elongation of the gauge region of the specimen at failure (break). Percent elongation (broken) is the residual set of the central 10 mm segment of the gauge region measured immediately after break, and so is a measure of recovery from highest elongation (ASTM D 412-2).</p><p>Stress Relaxation Test: ASTM E 328-96. The test specimen is deformed to the specified elongation at the specified rate, and then the decay of stress with time is measured while the specimen is held at fixed elongation. Tensile stress relaxation is reported as the decrease in stress during 5 minutes at 50% elongation (1.5.times.original gauge). Lower percent stress relaxation indicates better retention of recovery force during extended deformation time which is generally associated with better elastomer performance. However, stress decay occurs rapidly initially (about 4/5 during the initial 30 seconds for elastomeric polypropylene), and then decays asymptotically. Final set and stress are also reported.</p><p>Hysteresis Test: The 100% elongation hysteresis test was performed by extending the specimen to 2 successive cycles of extension and recovery, with 30 second hold at 100% elongation and 60 second hold after crosshead recovery between cycles. In this hysteresis test, tensile set is reported as the cumulative set from the first two extensions, measured as the elongation at which stress exceeds the baseline on the third extension. Stress relaxation is measured as the decrease in stress (or force) during the 30 sec. that the specimen is held at extension during the first cycle. Retained force is measured as the ratio of stress at 50% elongation during the second cycle recovery to the initial stress at 100% elongation during the same cycle. Lower set indicates higher elongational recovery. Higher values of retained force and lower values of stress relaxation indicate stronger recovery force. Better general elastomeric recovery properties are indicated by low set, high retained force and low stress relaxation. In contrast, a flexible polymer is characterized as one having above about 500% elongation, tensile modulus of below about 100 MPa, but essentially no retained force (at the 50% elongation point).</p><heading>EXAMPLES 30, 31</heading><heading>Propylene Homopolymerization with Catalyst D</heading><p>Polymerizations were carried out according to Method A and the results are presented in Table 1.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 1______________________________________Propylene Polymerizations Using Complex D and MAO.sup.aExam- Pressure           M.sub.w .sup.e                                [m].sup.f                                     [mmmm].sup.fple   psig (kPa)          Productivity.sup.d                    (                          M.sub.w /M.sub.n                                (%)  (%)______________________________________30.sup.b 25 (170) 250       196   3.3   75   4531.sup.c 35 (240) 500       243   3.2   78   51______________________________________ .sup.a Conditions: [Al]/[Zr] = 1000, T = 25 C, t = 60 min. .sup.b [Zr] = 5.5  .sup.c [Zr] = 5.0  .sup.d kg Polypropylene/mol.

Unexpectedly, these processes also result in significant increases in productivity and polymer molecular weight evidencing the PRE effect. Table 2 below shows the effect of ethylene on polymerization in liquid propylene using catalysts A, D, K, and M.</p><p>Viewing Table 2, in those polymerization systems containing ethylene, we observe that productivity increases by approximately an order of magnitude, as compared to those systems not containing ethylene (Examples 32, 33, 35, 38, 41, 44 and 47). Further, a 3 to 4 fold increase in molecular weight is observed for those polymers containing ethylene in percentages greater than about 14%.

No. 5,594,080, included by reference herein polymerize propylene to elastomeric polypropylenes with productivities which range from 200-13,000 kg polymer/mol Zr hr (see Examples 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 49 and 51). As evidence of the PRE effects, addition of ethylene to a propylene polymerization system has a dramatic and unexpectedly non-linear effect on the productivity of these catalysts. Whereas the productivity of ethylene polymerization at 25 psig (170 kPa) are in the range 3000-7280 kg polymer/mol Zr. hr (see Examples 67-71), surprisingly the addition of 28 psig (190 kPa) of ethylene to a propylene polymerization system derived from Catalyst D results in a completely unexpected and significant 10-fold increase in productivity at 20 C (6000 to 64,540 kg polymer/mol Zr. hr, Examples 38 and 39), clearly a non-linear effect. This means, inter alia, that catalysts that were previously considered marginal or not commercially of interest, can now be useful by using the PRE process of this invention. Indeed, if they possess other good properties, such catalysts that were formerly considered to be impractical, can now be rendered superior to other hereto faster catalysts by use in the EEF process of this invention.</p><p>The addition of ethylene into the polymerization systems of this invention leads to ethylene incorporation into the polymer. However, only an activity-enhancing amount of ethylene is required to increase the polymerization activity while simultaneously producing a high melting-temperature elastomeric polyolefin. Examples 72-75 show elastomeric homopolymers of propylene with excellent recovery properties (tensile set&amp;lt;12%) and stress relaxation in the range of 38-40% (100% hysteresis test). As shown in Examples 76-79, polymerization in the presence of only 1-2 weight % ethylene in the feed results in high polymerization activity and yields polyolefin elastomers with useful elastomeric properties, including melting points above 100 tensile set below 9% and stress relaxation in the range of 36-50%.</p><p>Moreover, as exemplified in Examples 80-85, a further aspect of the invention is the surprising observation that by adding ethylene to an unbridged fluxional metallocene polymerization system that would normally produce a flexible but non-elastomeric polyolefin results in an increase in polymerization activity and the production of useful elastomeric polymers. Comparing Example 80 with Examples 81-83, and Example 84 with Example 85, the addition of small amounts of ethylene to the polymerization increases the activity of the catalyst. In all cases, the activity of the ethylene/propylene copolymerization is higher than that of the homopolymerization in the absence of ethylene. Propylene homopolymers made with catalysts Q and S (Examples 80 and 84) exhibit yielding and drawing during deformation. They deform non-uniformly by localized necking and drawing during room temperature tensile tests at high deformation rates. These materials can be designated "flexible non-elastomeric thermoplastics" to distinguish them from "thermoplastic elastomers". Tensile set after the first two hysteresis cycles at 100% elongation is above 39% (indicating very poor recovery properties). Stress relaxation is also very high at greater than 60% as measured in the 5 minute stress relaxation test at 50% elongation. Retained force in the second cycle of the 100% elongation hysteresis test is zero. Thus, although the thermal properties of the polymers are excellent (m.p.&amp;gt;140 exhibit high elongations to break (600-800%), they are not elastomeric.</p><p>Upon addition of a ethylene/propylene mixture to the activated metallocenes Q and S, a new type of polymer is produced (Examples 81-83 and Example 85). These materials are clearly elastomeric in nature: They deform uniformly to high elongations and exhibit high recovery from elongation. The tensile set after the first hysteresis cycle at 100% elongation is below 20% (in some cases below 10%), indicating good recovery properties. Stress relaxation at 50% elongation is below 55%. The retained force increases from 0 (in the homopolymer examples) to over 10% (in the copolymer examples). In some cases, the retained force of the copolymers is over 25% (with 50% retained force being the theoretical maximum). Table 10 clearly shows that as the ethylene content of the copolymers increase (from 0 to 4 mole %), the elastomeric properties of the materials improve significantly. In addition, even with ca. 4 mole % ethylene incorporation into the copolymer, the melting points of these materials are greater than 100</p><p>Industrial Applicability:</p><p>It is clear that there is extensive industrial applicability for the novel unbridged catalysts of this invention and the PRE effect process of increasing reactivity by including small quantities of ethylene in an olefin monomer reaction system to substantially increase the rate of reaction and overall productivity to produce high melting elastomers having excellent properties including those produced by the EPE effect process.</p><p>It is also evident that the ligands of fluxional unbridged catalysts of the present invention and percent ethylene in the feed can be selected to tailor the properties of the polymers from crystalline theromplastics to amorphous gum elastomers to thermoplastic elastomers.</p><p>As is evident from the properties reported herein, the polymers produced in fiber, film, sheet, molded, cast, or extruded product form can be used in conjunction with or place of other polymers. For example, thin film elastomeric ethylene, propylene or copolymers of ethylene and propylene produced by the catalysts and processes of this invention can be used whereever films which have conforming, elastic, resilient or sealing properties are needed.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>We claim:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
