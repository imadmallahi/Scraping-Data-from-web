Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relates generally to liquid cleanser compositions and, more particularly, to solubility enhancement of alkylbenzene sulfonates, such as low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates, in aqueous cleanser formulations by addition of polyethylene glycols.</p><p>2. Description of Related Art</p><p>Linear alkylbenzene sulfonates ("LAS") are widely used surfactants in commercial cleanser products because of their effectiveness as detergents, ease of biodegradation, and relative low cost. Typically, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates are produced via sulfonation of linear alkylbenzene intermediates.</p><p>Linear alkylbenzene is typically manufactured on an industrial scale using one of two commercial processes which differ from one another primarily by virtue of the catalyst system employed. In this regard, one process employs an aluminum trichloride catalyst, while the other process uses a hydrogen fluoride catalyst. The two processes result in linear alkylbenzene products with different phenyl isomer distributions. For example, a typical phenyl isomer distribution for products of the aluminum trichloride process is about 30% 2-phenyl isomer and about 22% 3-phenyl isomer. In contrast, a typical phenyl isomer distribution for products of the hydrogen fluoride process is about 20% 2-phenyl isomer and about 20% 3-phenyl isomer, although reported values may differ. The product of the aluminum trichloride process, which is relatively high in 2-phenyl isomer content, is often referred to as "high 2-phenyl" linear alkylbenzene, whereas the product of the hydrogen fluoride process, which is relatively low in 2-phenyl isomer content, is often referred to as "low 2-phenyl" linear alkylbenzene.</p><p>The sulfonates of linear alkylbenzenes are known to exhibit different physical properties depending upon the position of the aromatic group on the alkyl chain. Therefore, high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates have physical properties that differ from low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. For example, high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates typically have a higher solubility in aqueous media than do low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Furthermore, an aqueous solution comprising a high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate may exhibit a higher viscosity than an aqueous solution comprising a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. In cases where maximum solubility of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate in an aqueous detergent formulation is of concern, a product containing a relatively high percentage of compounds in which the aromatic substituent is in the 2 or 3 position and a correspondingly smaller percentage of isomers in which the aromatic substituent is positioned centrally with respect to the alkyl chain may be advantageous.</p><p>In the past, poor aqueous solubility has typically precluded the use of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in detersive applications requiring a liquid formulation. For example, heavy duty liquid laundry detergents and liquid dishwashing detergent products have typically employed the more soluble high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates as anionic surfactants. However, the relative high cost of high 2-phenyl surfactants often presents a disadvantage to cost-conscious detergent formulators and marketers. The higher cost of high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates compared to low 2-phenyl surfactants stems from the greater expense associated with the aluminum trichloride process relative to the hydrogen fluoride process.</p><p>Attempts have been made to reduce the cost of liquid detergent formulations employing linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Typically, these have included attempts to facilitate the use of the relatively less expensive low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonates. For example, one method typically employed for improving solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in liquid detergent formulations has involved the addition of hydrotropes, such as sodium xylene sulfonate. As used herein, the term "hydrotrope" is defined to be a compound that has the property of increasing the aqueous solubility of various slightly soluble organic chemicals. However, the cost advantage of low 2-phenyl formulations may be partially or completely offset by the cost of the relatively large amount of hydrotropes typically required to effect improved low 2-phenyl surfactant solubility without any accompanying improvement in the detergency characteristics of the formulation. Furthermore, addition of large amounts of hydrotropes to a detergent formulation may have the undesirable effect of lowering the viscosity of the detergent.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In one respect, this invention is a surfactant composition including at least one alkylbenzene sulfonate and at least one polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer.

A cation of the 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant may include sodium.</p><p>In another respect, this invention is a method of enhancing solubility of alkylbenzene sulfonate in a surfactant composition including a solvent and alkylbenzene sulfonate, the method including adding a polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer to the surfactant composition. The alkylbenzene sulfonate may include low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate. The alkylbenzene sulfonate may have a 2-phenyl isomer content of less than or equal to 25% by weight. The alkylbenzene sulfonate may have a 2-phenyl isomer content of up to about 20% by weight. The solvent may include, but is not limited to, at least one of water, alcohol having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, glycol, glycol ether, or mixture thereof.

In another embodiment, the polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer may have a molecular weight of less than 400. In another embodiment, the polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer may have a molecular weight of from about 200 to about 300. In one embodiment, the step of adding polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer to the surfactant composition may include the step of adding a sufficient amount of polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer to the surfactant composition to result in a surfactant composition including from about 2% to about 40% low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate by total weight of the composition, and from about 0.2% to about 20% polyethylene glycol by total weight of the composition.</p><p>In yet another embodiment, the step of adding may include adding a polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer to a surfactant composition, typically a sodium LAS-containing surfactant composition, and lowering the cloud point of the surfactant composition to about 15 alternatively to from about 15 alternatively to from about 15 lowering the clear point of the surfactant composition to about 25 C. or lower, alternatively to from about 25 -5 -2 a polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer to a surfactant composition, typically a sodium LAS-containing composition, and lowering the cloud point of the surfactant composition by between about 10 about 40 composition by between about 10 relative to a conventional sodium LAS-containing composition lacking the disclosed polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer/s.</p><p>The disclosed method and compositions relate to enhanced or improved solubilization of alkylbenzene sulfonates, such as low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous detergent formulations. Among other things, liquid surfactant compositions including linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants are provided. In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, addition of polyethylene glycols to surfactant compositions including low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants surprisingly increases the solubility of the low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous solutions, resulting in lower cloud and clear points, and permitting formulation of liquid detergent compositions containing greater concentrations of relatively less expensive low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates.</p><p>Advantageously, in the practice of the disclosed method, polyethylene glycols may be added to an aqueous surfactant composition containing linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, such as low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, to enhance the solubility of the low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. Solubility enhancement typically results in a lowering of the cloud and clear points of the composition. For example, the cloud point of a surfactant composition comprising water, sodium hydroxide, and a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate compound may typically be depressed below the freezing point of water (0 lower, depending upon the concentration of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate present and depending upon the amount of polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer added. In the practice of the disclosed method, addition of polyethylene glycol compound/s to an aqueous surfactant composition lowers the cloud point of the composition typically to as low as about 10 as low as from about 5 typically to as low as from about 0</p><p>Such a surfactant composition may also include one or more solvents, typically in addition to water, such as alcohols, glycols, glycol ethers, mixtures thereof, etc. Suitable alcohols include, but are not limited to, straight chain alkyl alcohols (including those containing from one to six carbon atoms, e.g., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-hexanol, etc.), branched chain alkyl alcohols (including those containing from three to six carbon atoms, e.g., isopropanol and secondary butanol, etc.), glycols such as propylene glycol, diglycols such as propylene diglycol and triglycols such as triethylene glycol and glycol ethers such as butylene glycol diethylether and dipropylene glycol methylether. Such solvents (when added in addition to water), are typically added in an amount of between about 1% and about 20%, alternatively between about 5% and about 15%, alternatively between about 10% and about 15% by total weight of the composition, although greater or lesser amounts of such solvents may also be suitably employed.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>The disclosed method and compositions relate to enhanced or improved solubilization of low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous detergent formulations. Among other things, liquid surfactant compositions comprising low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants are provided.</p><p>In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, addition of polyethylene glycols to surfactant compositions including low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates surprisingly increases solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in an aqueous solution. Advantageously, increased solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate results in lower solution cloud points and clear points and permits formulation of liquid detergent compositions containing greater concentrations of relatively less expensive low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants.</p><p>As used herein, the term "cloud point" is defined as the temperature at which a substantially clear solution becomes opaque or cloudy. As used herein, the term "clear point" is defined as the temperature at which an opaque or cloudy solution becomes substantially clear. In either case, a substantially clear solution is a solution isotropic in appearance in which insoluble material is not visually discernible in the solution. In this regard, cloud point and/or clear point may be used as an indicator of the mutual solubility of the components in an aqueous solution. In the case of many detergent formulations incorporating LAS, this indicates the solubility/insolubility of the LAS component. In this regard, cloud point and/or clear point may be used as an indicator of the solubility of anionic surfactants in aqueous solution. All other parameters being equal, a lower cloud point and/or clear point is indicative of greater solute solubility. As illustrated in the examples included herein, cloud and clear point determinations show that the addition of relatively low molecular weight polyethylene glycols surprisingly increases solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous solutions, such as heavy duty liquid laundry detergent formulations. Advantageously, polyethylene glycol solubility enhancers of the disclosed method and compositions are capable of depressing the cloud and clear points of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants to temperatures lower than the cloud point temperatures typically achieved by hydrotropes. Further advantageously, the solubility enhancing effect of the disclosed surfactant compositions is typically attained using polyethylene glycol concentrations lower than those concentrations required for hydrotropes.</p><p>The disclosed method and compositions are useful with all types of liquid surfactant compositions in which linear alkyl benzene sulfonates are present as a surfactant component. Examples of such liquid compositions include, but are not limited to, heavy duty laundry detergents, herbicide emulsifiers, hard surface cleaners, bathroom cleaners, all purpose cleaners, car wash detergents, janitorial cleaners and light duty liquid detergents. Surprisingly, in accordance with the present disclosure, polyethylene glycol materials may be used to improve solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonates. Significantly, polyethylene glycol materials have been shown to offer superior solubility enhancing qualities over conventional solubility enhancers such as amines and hydrotrope materials. The addition of polyethylene glycols, most typically relatively lower molecular weight polyethylene glycols, acts to reduce the cloud and clear points of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonate materials to lower temperatures. Thus, polyethylene glycols improve the solubility and applicability of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonate materials in detergent formulations. The unexpected advantages of this method are the allowed use of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonate products and/or the use of considerably higher levels of these products in liquid detergent formulations while retaining the desired stability and aesthetic properties of these formulations.</p><p>In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, any low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate compound/s or mixture thereof suitable for use in liquid detergent formulations may be employed. Typical low 2-phenyl alkyl benzene sulfonate compounds include, but are not limited to, those prepared by alkylating benzene with straight chain monoolefins in the presence of hydrogen fluoride as catalyst, followed by sulfonation with any suitable sulfonating agent.</p><p>For example, preparation of suitable low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate compounds may include dehydrogenation of straight chain paraffins over a suitable catalyst, to provide a mixture containing the desired straight chain monoolefins as well as unreacted straight chain paraffins. This mixture may be passed to an alkylation unit wherein the straight chain monoolefins may be used to alkylate benzene to form the desired straight chain alkylbenzene compounds, as well as unreacted straight chain paraffins which may be readily separated therefrom by such procedures as distillation. Straight chain alkylbenzene compounds thus prepared may be sulfonated with any suitable sulfonating agent, such as sulfur trioxide, mixtures of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, chlorosulfonic acid, or the like, by conventional procedures. The resulting sulfonic acid may be neutralized with an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate, such as potassium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, or by the use of any other suitable base conventionally employed in the preparation of ammonium or alkali metal salts of aryl sulfonic acids.</p><p>It will be understood that benefit of the disclosed method and compositions may be realized in solutions including any alkylbenzene sulfonate compounds, including those of varying molecular weights, alkyl chain length and alkyl chain phenyl location combination.

Typically the phenyl isomer distribution is substantially uniform across the alkane. As used herein, "high 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate" characterizes alkylbenzene sulfonates having a phenyl isomer content of from greater than 25% to about 30% 2-phenyl isomer by weight. Typically, the phenyl isomer distribution is predominately in the 2 and 3 position of the alkane. It will be understood by those of skill in the art with benefit of this disclosure that mixtures of low-2-phenyl and high 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates are also possible, thus yielding 2-phenyl isomer content values between those defined above for the low 2-phenyl and high 2- phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates.</p><p>One specific low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate composition is a sulfonate prepared from a linear alkyl benzene known as ALKYLATE 225™ (commercially available from Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation). Other examples of suitable linear alkylbenzenes for preparing linear alkyl benzene sulfonates include, but are not limited to, ALKYLATE 215™, ALKYLATE 229™, ALKYLATE H230L™, and ALKYLATE H230H™ (also available from Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation). Suitable processes for sulfonating such linear alkyl benzenes include, but are not limited to, those employing an air/SO.sub.3 sulfonator or chlorosulfonic acid.</p><p>In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate may include any counterion or cation suitable for neutralization. In one embodiment a counterion or cation is typically ammonium or substituted ammonium. In this regard, a substituted ammonium may include, but is not limited to, monoethanol ammonium, diethanol ammonium, triethanol ammonium, or a mixture thereof In another embodiment, such a counterion or cation may be an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or a mixture thereof. Typical alkali metals include, but are not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, or a mixture thereof. Typical alkaline earth metals include, but are not limited to, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, or a mixture thereof.</p><p>The disclosed surfactant compositions may be provided in solid form without a solvent, or in liquid form with a solvent. In those embodiments employing solvents, any solvent suitable for use in the formulation of a liquid detergent formulation may be employed. Suitable solvents include, for example, those solvents capable of dissolving low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, water, alcohols, glycols and glycol ethers, or mixtures thereof. Specific examples of suitable alcohol solvents include, but are not limited to, alcohols having from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, typical specific solvents include water, straight chain alkyl alcohols containing from one to six carbon atoms (example: methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-hexanol, etc.), branched chain alkyl alcohols containing from three to six carbon atoms (example: isopropanol and secondary butanol), glycols such as propylene glycol, diglycols such as propylene diglycol and triglycols such as triethylene glycol and glycol ethers such as butylene glycol diethylether and dipropylene glycol methylether.</p><p>In the formulation and practice of the disclosed compositions and methods, any polyethylene glycol compound which is suitable for increasing solubility of a low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant in an aqueous solution may be employed. Typical examples of suitable polyethylene glycol compounds include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol compounds having a molecular weight of greater than about 200, alternatively between about 200 and about 2000, alternatively between 200 and about 900, alternatively between about 300 and about 600, and alternatively between about 400 and about 500. Other examples include polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of less than 500, alternatively having a molecular weight of less than 400, alternatively between less than 400 and about 200, alternatively less than about 300, and alternatively from about 200 to about 300.</p><p>One embodiment of the disclosed method and compositions employs one or more polyethylene glycol solubility enhancers having between about 4 and about 46, alternatively between about 4 and about 21, alternatively between about 7 and about 14, and alternatively between about 9 and about 12 ethylene glycol monomers joined by ether linkages. Specific examples of such polyethylene glycol compounds include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol products marketed by Huntsman Chemical Corporation under the trade name POGOL™ (such as, for example, POGOL 200™, POGOL 300™, POGOL 400™, POGOL 500™, POGOL 600™, and POGOL 900™). In the case of POGOL™ compounds, the numeric designation indicates the average molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol compounds.</p><p>The disclosed surfactant compositions including a solvent typically have reduced cloud and clear points relative to similar conventional surfactant/solvent compositions (i.e., with similar components, but without the disclosed polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer). With benefit of this disclosure, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that detergent compositions having any suitable amount of alkylbenzene sulfonate known in the art may benefit from the polyethylene glycol solubility enhancers of the present disclosure, and it will further be understood that any amount or mixture of polyethylene glycols effective for enhancing solubility of such alkylbenzene sulfonates in detergent compositions, and/or effective for lowering the cloud or clear point of such compositions, may be employed. Typically, sodium LAS embodiments of the disclosed surfactant compositions have reduced cloud and clear points of about 10 25 sodium LAS only composition.</p><p>In various embodiments, the disclosed sodium LAS-containing surfactant solutions may have cloud points equal to or less than about 15 about 10 C., respectively. In various other embodiments, the disclosed sodium LAS-containing surfactant solutions may have clear points of less than or equal to about 25 about 10 respectively.</p><p>For example, in the practice of one embodiment of the disclosed method and compositions, a surfactant or detergent composition typically includes between about 2% and about 40% by weight of sodium low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant, between about 0.2% and about 20% by weight of polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer (such as POGOL 400™, etc.), and between about 40% and about 97.8% by weight of water and/or alternatively other solvents (such as alcohol, glycol, glycol ether, etc.). In another embodiment, a surfactant composition may include between about 5% and about 30% by weight of sodium low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant, between about 0.5% and about 10% by weight of polyethylene glycol (such as POGOL 400™, etc.), solubility enhancer, and between about 60% and about 94.5% by weight of water and/or alternatively other solvents (such as alcohol, glycol, glycol ether, etc.). In still another surfactant composition embodiment, a surfactant composition includes between about 15% and about 30% by weight of sodium low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant, between about 0.8% and about 8% by weight of polyethylene glycol solubility enhancer (such as POGOL 400™, etc.), and between about 62% and about 84.2% by weight of water and/or alternatively other solvents (such as alcohol, glycol, glycol ether, etc.). With benefit of this disclosure, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that a surfactant composition may take the form of a liquid or alternatively a paste or solid form, depending on the molecular weight of the LAS and polyethylene glycol components, and/or if the amount of solvent is greatly reduced or eliminated.</p><p>In other typical embodiments, a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene-based sulfonate surfactant composition may also contain optional additives including, but not limited to, cationic co-surfactant, anionic co-surfactant, nonionic co-surfactant, detergency builder, enzyme, enzyme oxidation scavenger, soil suspending agent, soil-release polymer, bactericide, coloring agent, foam control agent, corrosion inhibitor, perfume, or a mixture thereof.

It consisted of a jacketed cell which contained isopropanol. Isopropanol was also passed from a cooler through the outside of the cell jacket. Temperatures of below -20 Temperatures well below -10 immersed in the isopropanol contained in the cell. A test tube which contained the sample to be evaluated and a thermometer was immersed in the cell isopropanol and evaluated for cloud development under conditions of continuous mixing by means of the thermometer. The temperature at which a resistant cloud developed was identified as the cloud point.</p><p>Clear points were determined by letting the test sample, in the test tube, warm slowly, after complete clouding, under ambient conditions, until a state of complete isotropic appearance was attained. The sample, while warming, was stirred intermittently by means of the thermometer that remained in the test tube. The temperature at which the test sample became isotropic was recorded as the clear point.</p><p>Note that for HDLD solutions, a similar procedure was used, except that a test tube was immersed in ice and salt to determine the cloud points.</p><heading>Cloud/Clear Point Results</heading><p>The value of ([Additive]/([Additive]+[SLAS])) 15 as a measurement of additive efficacy ("EF"). This represents the percent of the total SLAS plus additive used that is additive. This value, for each additive, as the cloud point reaches 0 the first time may be used as an indicator of additive efficacy. The lower this number is, the more efficacious the additive. The above equation is represented herein by "EF".</p><p>In Example 3, cloud point/clear point determinations were also made for solutions containing a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant ("LAS") in the presence of varying amounts of the disclosed polyethylene glycol solubility enhancers. Initially, each solution contained 5.0 g low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid prepared from ALKYLATE 225™ available from Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation, neutralized with 0.653 g sodium hydroxide, and 19.353 g water. Incremental amounts of polyethylene glycol solubility enhancing agent were added by titration to each solution, and cloud points and clear points were then determined.</p><p>Tables 7, 8 and 9 contain detailed information regarding cloud points and clear points of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate solutions to which one of the disclosed polyethylene glycol solubility enhancers has been added (POGOL 200™, POGOL 300™, or POGOL 900™, available from Huntsman Chemical Corporation). Table 15 contains a summary of the results of Example 3, as well as the results of Comparative Example A.</p><p>Table 15 shows the first cloud point attained below 0 the lowest cloud point attained, and the clear point corresponding to the 0 where the cloud point remained above 0 attained for each additive tested. Table 15 additionally presents the amount of each additive tested both as a percentage by weight of the entire solution, and as a percentage by weight of the amount of low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate and additive present in solution. As can be seen from these results, all three polyethylene glycol materials tested were capable of attaining a lower cloud point (-7 conventional additives tested. Furthermore, a much greater percentage by weight of each of the conventional additives of Comparative Example A was required to produce a solution with a cloud point less than 0 relative to the polyethylene glycol materials.</p><p>As may be seen from the data in Tables 7, 8 and 9 both cloud and clear points were lowered substantially by addition of each of the tested polyethylene glycol solubility enhancers. Referring to Table 15, lower values of % additive (expressed as a function of weight of additive and alkylbenzene sulfonate, and also as function of weight of total solution) indicate less of the disclosed polyethylene glycol additives than the tested conventional additives were required to make the 225A™ low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate sodium salt soluble in a water solution. In this regard, lower cloud points and clear points were achieved using lower amounts of polyethylene glycol additives (POGOL 200™, POGOL 300™, and POGOL 900™) than were achieved with the conventional additives tested. In the aqueous solution, it may be seen that half of the amount, or less, POGOL 300™ are needed to attain cloud points lower than those of the best-performing tested hydrotrope ("DOWFAX 3B2").</p><p>The results summarized in Table 15 clearly indicate the superiority of three polyethylene glycol materials (POGOL 200™, POGOL 300™, and POGOL 900™) for improving the solubility of a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant in comparison to the performance of several known conventional solubility-enhancing additives tested in Comparative Example A.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 7______________________________________LAS Solution With No Sodium Sulfate Salt AddedAddition of POGOL 200 ™Solution #   200-1   200-2   200-3 200-4 200-5______________________________________% LAS acid (by wt.)        20.00   19.60   18.86 17.85 16.66% H.sub.2 O  77.39   75.88   73.01 69.10 64.50% NaOH (1:1) 2.61    2.56    2.46  2.33  2.18% POGOL 200 ™        0       1.96    5.66  10.71 16.66Cloud Point (        20      3       -4    -4    -7Clear Point (        16      6       2     3     -1______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 8______________________________________LAS Solution With No Sodium Sulfate Salt AddedAddition of POGOL 300 ™Solution #  300-1   300-2  300-3 300-4                                 300-5 300-6______________________________________% LAS acid (by wt.)       20.00   19.23  18.51 17.85                                 17.24 16.66% H.sub.2 O 77.39   74.42  71.66 69.10                                 66.77 64.50% NaOH (1:1)       2.61    2.51   2.42  2.33 2.25  2.18% POGOL 300 ™       0       3.85   7.41  10.71                                 13.79 16.66Cloud Point (       20      -4     -5    -5   -5.5  -7Clear Point (       14      4      4     4    2     3______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 9______________________________________LAS Solution With No Sodium Sulfate Salt AddedAddition of POGOL 900 ™Solution #   900-1   900-2   900-3 900-4 900-5______________________________________% LAS acid (by wt.)        20.00   19.23   18.51 17.85 17.24% H.sub.2 O  77.39   74.42   71.66 69.10 66.72% NaOH (1:1) 2.61    2.51    2.42  2.33  2.25% POGOL 900 ™        0       3.85    7.41  10.71 13.79Cloud Point (        16      0       -5    -6    -7Clear Point (        15      3       4     4     2______________________________________</pre></p><heading>Comparative Example A</heading><p>In this example, cloud point/clear point determinations were made using the solution containing low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant of Example 3.

MDEA is methyldiethanol amine and DMEA is dimethylethanol amine. Both of these amines are employed as solubilization agents for other surfactant systems. SXS, MDEA and DMEA are commercially available from Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation. The Dowfax materials are mixtures of sulfonated alkyldiphenyl ethers commercially available from Dow Chemical Co.
