The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of using the instant compounds in the treatment of cancer. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays essential roles in embryonic development and pathogenesis of various diseases, such as degenerative neuronal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Recent work has led to the identification of various pro- and anti-apoptotic gene products that are involved in the regulation or execution of programmed cell death. Expression of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl2 or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, inhibits apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as Bax or Bad, leads to programmed cell death (Aams et al. Science, 281:1322-1326 (1998)). The execution of programmed cell death is mediated by caspase-1 related proteinases, including caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8 and caspase-9 etc (Thornberry et al. Science, 281:1312-1316 (1998)).</p><p num="p0003">The phosphatidylinositol 3'-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway appears important for regulating cell survival/cell death (Kulik et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 17: 1595-1606 (1997); Franke et al, Cell, 88:435-437 (1997); Kauffmann-Zeh et al. Nature 385:544-548 (1997) Hemmings Science, 275:628-630 (1997); Dudek et al., Science, 275:661-665 (1997)). Survival factors, such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), promote cell survival under various conditions by inducing the activity of PI3K (Kulik et al. 1997, Hemmings 1997). Activated PI3K leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (Ptdlns(3,4,5)-P3), which in turn binds to, and promotes the activation of, the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain (Franke et al Cell, 81:727-736 (1995); Hemmings Science, 277:534 (1997); Downward, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 10:262-267 (1998), Alessi et al., EMBO J. 15: 6541-6551 (1996)). Specific inhibitors of PI3K or dominant negative Akt mutants abolish survival-promoting activities of these growth factors or cytokines. It has been previously disclosed that inhibitors of PI3K</p><p num="p0004">(LY294002 or wortmannin) blocked the activation of Akt by upstream kinases. In addition, introduction of constitutively active PI3K or Akt mutants promotes cell survival under conditions in which cells normally undergo apoptotic cell death (Kulik et al. 1997, Dudek et al.&lt;,1997).</p><p num="p0005">Three members of the Akt subfamily of second-messenger regulated serine/threonine protein kinases have been identified and termed Aktl/ PKBα, Akt2/PKBβ, and Akt3/PKBγ (hereinafter 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
referred to as "Aktl", "Akt2" and "Akt3"), respectively. The isoforms are homologous, particularly in regions encoding the catalytic domains. Akts are activated by phosphorylation events occurring in response to PI3K signaling. PI3K phosphorylates membrane inositol phospholipids, generating the second messengers phosphatidyl-inositol 3,4,5-vrisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which have been shown to bind to the PH domain of Akt. The current model of Akt activation proposes recruitment of the enzyme to the membrane by 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, where phosphorylation of the regulatory sites of Akt by the upstream kinases occurs (B.A. Hemmings, Science 275:628-630 (1997); B.A. Hemmings, Science 276:534 (1997); J. Downward, Science 279:673-674 (1998)). Phosphorylation of Aktl occurs on two regulatory sites, Thr<sup>308</sup> in the catalytic domain activation loop and on Ser<sup>473</sup>near the carboxy terminus (D. R. Alessi et al. EMBO J. 15:6541-6551 (1996) and R. Meier et al. J. Biol. Chem. 272:30491-30497 (1997)). Equivalent regulatory phosphorylation sites occur in Akt2 and Akt3. The upstream kinase, which phosphorylates Akt at the activation loop site has been cloned and termed 3'-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 phosphorylates not only Akt, but also p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, p90RSK, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), and protein kinase C. The upstream kinase phosphorylating the regulatory site of Akt/PKB near the carboxy terminus has not been identified yet, but recent reports imply a role for the integrin-linked kinase (ILK-1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, or autophosphorylation. Analysis of Akt levels in human tumors showed that Akt2 is overexpressed in a significant number of ovarian (J. Q. Cheng et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:9267-9271(1992)) and pancreatic cancers (J. Q. Cheng et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:3636-3641 (1996)). Similarly, Akt3 was found to be overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer cell lines (Nakatani et al. J. Biol. Chem. 274:21528-21532 (1999). The tumor suppressor PTEN, a protein and lipid phosphatase that specifically removes the 3' phosphate of Ptdlns(3,4,5)-P3, is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Li et al. Science 275:1943-1947 (1997), Stambolic et al. Cell 95:29-39 (1998), Sun et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96:6199-6204 (1999)). Germline mutations of PTEN are responsible for human cancer syndromes such as Cowden disease (Liaw et al. Nature Genetics 16:64-67 (1997)). PTEN is deleted in a large percentage of human tumors and tumor cell lines without functional PTEN show elevated levels of activated Akt (Li et al. supra, Guldberg et al. Cancer Research 57:3660-3663 (1997), Risinger et al. Cancer Research 57:4736-4738 (1997)).</p><p num="p0006">These observations demonstrate that the PI3K Akt pathway plays important roles for regulating cell survival or apoptosis in tumorigenesis.

 Inhibition of Akt activation and activity can be achieved by inhibiting PI3K with inhibitors such as LY294002 and wortmannin. However, PI3K inhibition has the potential to indiscriminately affect not just all three Akt isozymes but also other PH domain-containing signaling molecules that are dependent on Pdtlns(3,4,5)-P3, such as the Tec family of tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, it has been disclosed that Akt can be activated by growth signals that are independent of PI3K.</p><p num="p0007">Alternatively, Akt activity can be inhibited by blocking the activity of the upstream kinase PDKl. No specific PDKl inhibitors have been disclosed. Again, inhibition of PDKl would result in inhibition of multiple protein kinases whose activities depend on PDKl, such as atypical PKC isoforms, SGK, and S6 kinases (Williams et al. Curr. Biol. 10:439-448 (2000).</p><p num="p0008">It is an object of the instant invention to provide novel compounds that are inhibitors of Akt.</p><p num="p0009">It is also an object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions that comprise the novel compounds that are inhibitors of Akt.</p><p num="p0010">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method for treating cancer that comprises administering such inhibitors of Akt activity.</p><p num="p0011">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0012">The instant invention provides for compounds which comprise substituted pyridines that inhibit Akt activity.

Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Lines drawn into the ring systems from substituents represent that the indicated bond may be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms. If the ring system is polycyclic, it is intended that the bond be attached to any of the suitable carbon atoms on the proximal ring only.</p><p num="p0053">It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art, as well as those methods set forth below, from readily available starting materials. If a substituent is itself substituted with more than one group,, it is understood that these multiple groups may be on the same carbon or on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results. The phrase "optionally substituted with one or more substituents" should be taken to be equivalent to the phrase "optionally substituted with at least one substituent" and in such cases an embodiment will have from zero to four substituents, and another embodiment will have from zero to three substituents.</p><p num="p0054">As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, Cι-Cχo, as in "Cχ-Cχo alkyl" is defined to include groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement. For example, "Cj. -Cχo alkyl" specifically includes methyl, ethyl, π-propyl, i- propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, i-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, and so on. The term "cycloalkyl" means a monocyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, "cycloalkyl" includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl- cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and so on. "Alkoxy" represents either a cyclic or non-cyclic alkyl group of indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. "Alkoxy" therefore encompasses the definitions of alkyl and cycloalkyl above.</p><p num="p0055">If no number of carbon atoms is specified, the term "alkenyl" refers to a non-aromatic hydrocarbon radical, straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon double bond. In an embodiment, one carbon to carbon double bond is present, and up to four non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bonds may be present. Thus, "C2-C6 alkenyl" means an alkenyl radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkenyl groups include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, 2-

methylbutenyl and cyclohexenyl. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkenyl group may contain double bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkenyl group is indicated.</p><p num="p0056">The term "alkynyl" refers to a hydrocarbon radical straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon triple bond. Up to three carbon- carbon triple bonds may be present. Thus, "C2-C6 alkynyl" means an alkynyl radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkynyl groups include ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, 3-methylbutynyl and so on. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkynyl group may contain triple bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkynyl group is indicated.</p><p num="p0057">In certain instances, substituents may be defined with a range of carbons that includes zero, such as (C()-C6)alkylene-aryl.

Examples of such aryl elements include phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydro-naphthyl, indanyl and biphenyl. In cases where the aryl substituent is bicyclic and one ring is non-aromatic, it is understood that attachment is via the aromatic ring.</p><p num="p0059">The term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclyl" as used herein is intended to mean a 3- to 10- membered aromatic or nonaromatic heterocycle containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N and S, and includes bicyclic groups. "Heterocyclyl" therefore includes the above mentioned heteroaryls, as well as dihydro and tetrathydro analogs thereof.

Opin. Biol. Ther. (2002) 2(8):953-966, for example. The role of angiogenesis in cancer has been shown in numerous types of cancer and tissues: breast carcinoma (G. Gasparini and A.L. Harris, J. Clin. Oncol, 1995, 13:765-782; M. Toi et al, Japan. J. Cancer Res., 1994, 85:1045-1049); bladder carcinomas (A.J. Dickinson et al., Br. J. Urol, 1994, 74:762-766); colon carcinomas (L.M.

Other cancers include, advanced tumors, hairy cell leukemia, melanoma, advanced head and neck, metastatic renal cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, metastatic breast, breast adenocarcinoma, advanced melanoma, pancreatic, gastric, glioblastoma, lung, ovarian, non-small cell lung, prostate, small cell lung, renal cell carcinoma, various solid tumors, multiple myeloma, metastatic prostate, malignant glioma, renal cancer, lymphoma, refractory metastatic disease, refractory multiple myeloma, cervical cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, recurrent anaplastic glioma, and metastatic colon cancer (Dredge et al., Expert Opin.

Thus, the Akt inhibitors disclosed in the instant application, are also useful in the treatment of these angiogenesis related cancers.</p><p num="p0088">Tumors which have undergone neovascularization show an increased potential for metastasis. In fact, angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. (S.P. Cunningham, et al., Can. Research, 61: 3206-3211 (2001)). The Akt inhibitors disclosed in the present application are therefore also useful to prevent or decrease tumor cell metastasis.</p><p num="p0089">Further included within the scope of the invention is a method of treating or preventing a disease in which angiogenesis is implicated, which is comprised of administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention. Ocular neovascular diseases are an example of conditions where much of the resulting tissue damage can be attributed to aberrant infiltration of blood vessels in the eye (see WO 00/30651, published 2 lune 2000). The undesireable infiltration can be triggered by ischemic retinopathy, such as that resulting from diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, retinal vein occlusions, etc., or by degenerative diseases, such as the choroidal neovascularization observed in age-related macular degeneration. Inhibiting the growth of blood vessels by administration of the present compounds would therefore prevent the infiltration of blood vessels and prevent or treat diseases where angiogenesis is implicated, such as ocular diseases like retinal vascularization, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and the like. Further included within the scope of the invention is a method of treating or preventing a non-malignant disease in which angiogenesis is implicated, including but not limited to: ocular diseases (such as, retinal vascularization, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration), atherosclerosis, arthritis, psoriasis, obesity and Alzheimer's disease (Dredge et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. (2002) 2(8): 953-966). In another embodiment, a method of treating or preventing a disease in

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to mask the unpleasant taste of the drug or delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a water soluble taste masking material such as hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, or a time delay material such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate buryrate may be employed.</p><p num="p0098">Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water soluble carrier such as polyethyleneglycol or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.</p><p num="p0099">Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions.

The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.</p><p num="p0100">Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisol or alpha-tocopherol.</p><p num="p0101">Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example

These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.</p><p num="p0102">The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in- water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.</p><p num="p0104">The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient may be first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulation. The injectable solutions or microemulsions may be introduced into a patient's bloodstream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In order to maintain such a constant concentration, a continuous intravenous delivery device may be utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS™ model 5400 intravenous pump.</p><p num="p0105">The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.

Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.</p><p num="p0108">When a composition according to this invention is administered into a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient's symptoms. In an embodiment, a suitable amount of an inhibitor of Akt is administered to a mammal undergoing treatment for cancer. Administration occurs in an amount of inhibitor of between about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight to about 60 mg/kg of body weight per day, or between 0.5 mg/kg of body weight to about 40 mg/kg of body weight per day. Another therapeutic dosage that comprises the instant composition includes from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg of inhibitor of Akt.

of 6-10 week old female nude mice (Harlan) on day 0. The mice are randomly assigned to a vehicle, compound or combination treatment group. Daily subcutaneous administration begins on day 1 and continues for the duration of the experiment. Alternatively, the inhibitor test compound may be administered by a continuous infusion pump. Compound, compound combination or vehicle is delivered in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Tumors are excised and weighed when all of the vehicle-treated animals exhibited lesions of 0.5 - 1.0 cm in diameter, typically 4 to 5.5 weeks after the cells were injected. The average weight of the tumors in each treatment group for each cell line is calculated.
