oxidation of an alkane or a mixture of an alkane and an alkene to an unsaturated carboxylic
acid and for the vapor phase ammoxidation of an alkane or a mixture of an alkane and an
alkene to an unsaturated nitrile. The multi-metal oxide catalyst comprises
at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ni, Pd, Cu, Ag and Au.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention relates to an improved catalyst for the oxidation of alkanes or a
mixture of alkanes and alkenes to their corresponding unsaturated carboxylic acids by vapor
phase catalytic oxidation; to a method of making the catalyst; and to a process for the vapor
phase catalytic oxidation of alkanes or a mixture of alkanes and alkenes to their
corresponding unsaturated carboxylic acids.</p><p num="0002">The present invention also relates to a method of producing unsaturated nitriles by
subjecting alkanes or a mixture of alkanes and alkenes to vapor phase catalytic oxidation in
the presence of ammonia.</p><p num="0003">Nitriles, such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, have been industrially produced
as important intermediates for the preparation of fibers, synthetic resins, synthetic rubbers,
and the like. The most popular method for producing such nitriles is to subject an olefin such
as propene or isobutene to a catalytic reaction with ammonia and oxygen in the presence of a
catalyst in a gaseous phase at a high temperature. Known catalysts for conducting this
reaction include a Mo-Bi-P-O catalyst, a V-Sb-O catalyst, an Sb-U-V-Ni-O catalyst, a Sb-Sn-O
catalyst, a V-Sb-W-P-O catalyst and a catalyst obtained by mechanically mixing a V-Sb-W-O
oxide and a Bi-Ce-Mo-W-O oxide. However, in view of the price difference between
propane and propene or between isobutane and isobutene, attention has been drawn to the
development of a method for producing acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile by an
ammoxidation reaction wherein a lower alkane, such as propane or isobutane, is used as a
starting material, and it is catalytically reacted with ammonia and oxygen in a gaseous phase
in the presence of a catalyst.</p><p num="0004">In particular, U.S. Patent No. 5,281,745 discloses a method for producing an

important as starting materials for various synthetic resins, coating materials and plasticizers.
Commercially, the current process for acrylic acid manufacture involves a two-step catalytic
oxidation reaction starting with a propene feed. In the first stage, propene is converted to
acrolein over a modified bismuth molybdate catalyst. In the second stage, acrolein product
from the first stage is converted to acrylic acid using a catalyst composed of mainly
molybdenum and vanadium oxides. In most cases, the catalyst formulations are proprietary to
the catalyst supplier, but, the technology is well established. Moreover, there is an incentive
to develop a single step process to prepare the unsaturated acid from its corresponding
alkene. Therefore, the prior art describes cases where complex metal oxide catalysts are
utilized for the preparation of unsaturated acid from a corresponding alkene in a single step.</p><p num="0009">European Published Patent Application No. 0 630 879 B1 discloses a process for

preferably at least one of which contains oxygen, and at least one solvent in appropriate
amounts to form the slurry or solution. Preferably, a solution is formed at this stage of the
catalyst preparation. Generally, the metal compounds contain elements A, M, N, X, Z and O,
as previously defined.</p><p num="0031">Suitable solvents include water; alcohols including , but not limited to, methanol,
ethanol, propanol, and diols, etc.; as well as other polar solvents known in the art. Generally,
water is preferred. The water is any water suitable for use in chemical syntheses including,
without limitation, distilled water and de-ionized water. The amount of water present is
preferably an amount sufficient to keep the elements substantially in solution long enough to
avoid or minimize compositional and/or phase segregation during the preparation steps.
Accordingly, the amount of water will vary according to the amounts and solubilities of the
materials combined. However, as stated above, the amount of water is preferably sufficient to
ensure an aqueous solution is formed , and not a slurry, at the time of mixing.</p><p num="0032">For example, when a mixed metal oxide of the formula Mo<sub>a</sub>V<sub>b</sub>Te<sub>c</sub>Nb<sub>d</sub>Au<sub>e</sub>O<sub>f</sub> wherein
the element A is Mo, the element M is V, the element N is Te and the element X is Nb, is to 
be prepared, an aqueous solution of niobium oxalate may be added to an aqueous solution or
slurry of ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium metavanadate, telluric acid and ammonium
tetrachloroaurate, so that the atomic ratio of the respective metal elements would be in the
prescribed proportions.</p><p num="0033">Once the aqueous slurry or solution (preferably a solution) is formed, the water is
removed by any suitable method, known in the art, to form a catalyst precursor. Such
methods include, without limitation, vacuum drying, freeze drying, spray drying, rotary
evaporation and air drying. Vacuum drying is generally performed at pressures ranging from
10mmHg to 500mmHg. Freeze drying typically entails freezing the slurry or solution, using ,
for instance, liquid nitrogen, and drying the frozen slurry or solution under vacuum. Spray
drying is generally performed under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon, with an
inlet temperature ranging from 125¬∞C to 200¬∞C and an outlet temperature ranging from 75¬∞C
to 150¬∞C. Rotary evaporation is generally performed at a bath temperature of from 25¬∞C to
90¬∞C and at a pressure of from 10mmHg to 760mmHg, preferably at a bath temperature of
from 40¬∞ to 90¬∞C and at a pressure of from 10mmHg to 350mmHg, more preferably at a bath
temperature of from 40¬∞C to 60¬∞C and at a pressure of from 10mmHg to 40mmHg. Air
drying may be effected at temperatures ranging from 25¬∞C to 90¬∞C. Rotary evaporation or air
drying are generally preferred.</p><p num="0034">Once obtained, the catalyst precursor is calcined. The calcination may be conducted in
an oxygen-containing atmosphere or in the substantial absence of oxygen, e.g., in an inert
atmosphere or in vacuo. The inert atmosphere may be any material which is substantially
inert, i.e., does not react or interact with, the catalyst precursor. Suitable examples include,
without limitation, nitrogen, argon, xenon, helium or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the inert
atmosphere is argon or nitrogen. The inert atmosphere may flow over the surface of the
catalyst precursor or may not flow thereover (a static environment). When the inert
atmosphere does flow over the surface of the catalyst precursor, the flow rate can vary over a
wide range, e.g., at a space velocity of from 1 to 500 hr<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p num="0035">The calcination is usually performed at a temperature of from 350¬∞C to 850¬∞C,
preferably from 400¬∞C to 700¬∞C, more preferably from 500¬∞C to 640¬∞C. The calcination is
performed for an amount of time suitable to form the aforementioned catalyst. Typically, the
calcination is performed for from 0.5 to 30 hours, preferably from 1 to 25 hours, more
preferably for from I to 15 hours, to obtain the desired promoted mixed metal oxide. </p><p num="0036">In a preferred mode of operation, the catalyst precursor is calcined in two stages. In
the first stage, the catalyst precursor is calcined in an oxidizing environment (e.g. air) at a
temperature of from 200¬∞C to 400¬∞C, preferably from 275¬∞C to 325¬∞C for from 15 minutes to
8 hours, preferably for from 1 to 3 hours. In the second stage, the material from the first stage
is calcined in a non-oxidizing environment (e.g., an inert atmosphere) at a temperature of
from 500¬∞C to 750¬∞C, preferably for from 550¬∞C to 650¬∞C, for 15 minutes to 8 hours,
preferably for from 1 to 3 hours. Optionally, a reducing gas, such as, for example, ammonia
or hydrogen, may be added during the second stage calcination.</p><p num="0037">In a particularly preferred mode of operation, the catalyst precursor in the first stage is
placed in the desired oxidizing atmosphere at room temperature and then raised to the first
stage calcination temperature and held there for the desired first stage calcination time. The
atmosphere is then replaced with the desired non-oxidizing atmosphere for the second stage
calcination, the temperature is raised to the desired second stage calcination temperature and
held there for the desired second stage calcination time.</p><p num="0038">Although any type of heating mechanism, e.g., a furnace, may be utilized during the
calcination, it is preferred to conduct the calcination under a flow of the designated gaseous
environment. Therefore, it is advantageous to conduct the calcination in a bed with
continuous flow of the desired gas(es) through the bed of solid catalyst precursor particles.</p><p num="0039">With calcination, a catalyst is formed having the formula A<sub>a</sub>M<sub>b</sub>N<sub>c</sub>X<sub>a</sub>Z<sub>e</sub>O<sub>f</sub> wherein A,
M, N, X, Z, O, a, b, c, d, e and fare as previously defined.</p><p num="0040">The starting materials for the above promoted mixed metal oxide are not limited to
those described above. A wide range of materials including, for example, oxides, nitrates,
halides or oxyhalides, alkoxides, acetylacetonates, and organometallic compounds may be
used. For example, ammonium heptamolybdate may be utilized for the source of
molybdenum in the catalyst. However, compounds such as MoO<sub>3</sub>, MoO<sub>2</sub>, MoCl<sub>5</sub>, MoOCl<sub>4</sub>,
Mo(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, molybdenum acetylacetonate, phosphomolybdic acid and silicomolybdic acid
may also be utilized instead of ammonium heptamolybdate. Similarly, ammonium
metavanadate may be utilized for the source of vanadium in the catalyst. However,
compounds such as V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, VOCl<sub>3</sub>, VCl<sub>4</sub>, VO(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, vanadium acetylacetonate and
vanadyl acetylacetonate may also be utilized instead of ammonium metavanadate. The
tellurium source may include telluric acid, TeCl<sub>4</sub>, Te(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Te(OCH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> and TeO<sub>2</sub>.
The niobium source may include ammonium niobium oxalate, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, NbCl<sub>5</sub>, niobic acid or 
Nb(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5</sub> as well as the more conventional niobium oxalate. The nickel source may
include nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate, Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, nickel(II) oxalate, NiO, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>,
NiBr<sub>2</sub>, nickel(II) acetylacetonate, nickel(II) sulfate, NiS or nickel metal. The palladium source
may include Pd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, palladium(II) acetate, palladium oxalate, PdO, Pd(OH)<sub>2</sub>, PdCl<sub>2</sub>,
palladium acetylacetonate or palladium metal. The copper source may be copper acetate,
copper acetate monohydrate, copper acetate hydrate, copper acetylacetonate, copper bromide,
copper carbonate, copper chloride, copper chloride dihydrate, copper fluoride, copper formate
hydrate, copper gluconate, copper hydroxide, copper iodide, copper methoxide, copper
nitrate, copper nitrate hydrate, copper oxide, copper tartrate hydrate or a solution of copper in
an aqueous inorganic acid, e.g., nitric acid. The silver source may be silver acetate, silver
acetylacetonate, silver benzoate, silver bromide, silver carbonate, silver chloride, silver citrate
hydrate, silver fluoride, silver iodide, silver lactate, silver nitrate, silver nitrite, silver oxide,
silver phosphate or a solution of silver in an aqueous inorganic acid, e.g., nitric acid. The
gold source may be ammonium tetrachloroaurate, gold bromide, gold chloride, gold cyanide,
gold hydroxide, gold iodide, gold oxide, gold trichloride acid and gold sulfide.</p><p num="0041">A promoted mixed metal oxide, thus obtained, exhibits excellent catalytic activities by
itself. However, the promoted mixed metal oxide can be converted to a catalyst having higher
activities by grinding.</p><p num="0042">There is no particular restriction as to the grinding method, and conventional methods
may be employed. As a dry grinding method, a method of using a gas stream grinder may, for
example, be mentioned wherein coarse particles are permitted to collide with one another in a
high speed gas stream for grinding. The grinding may be conducted not only mechanically
but also by using a mortar or the like in the case of a small scale operation.</p><p num="0043">As a wet grinding method wherein grinding is conducted in a wet state by adding
water or an organic solvent to the above mixed metal oxide, a conventional method of using a
rotary cylinder-type medium mill or a medium-stirring type mill, may be mentioned. The
rotary cylinder-type medium mill is a wet mill of the type wherein a container for the object
to be ground is rotated, and it includes, for example, a ball mill and a rod mill. The medium-stirring
type mill is a wet mill of the type wherein the object to be ground, contained in a
container is stirred by a stirring apparatus, and it includes, for example, a rotary screw type
mill, and a rotary disc type mill. </p><p num="0044">The conditions for grinding may suitably be set to meet the nature of the above-mentioned
promoted mixed metal oxide, the viscosity, the concentration, etc. of the solvent
used in the case of wet grinding, or the optimum conditions of the grinding apparatus.
However, it is preferred that grinding is conducted until the average particle size of the
ground catalyst precursor would usually be at most 20¬µm, more preferably at most 5¬µm.
Improvement in the catalytic performance may occur due to such grinding.</p><p num="0045">Further, in some cases, it is possible to further improve the catalytic activities by
further adding a solvent to the ground catalyst precursor to form a solution or slurry, followed
by drying again. There is no particular restriction as to the concentration of the solution or
slurry, and it is usual to adjust the solution or slurry so that the total amount of the starting
material compounds for the ground catalyst precursor is from 10 to 60 wt %. Then, this
solution or slurry is dried by a method such as spray drying, freeze drying, evaporation to
dryness or vacuum drying, preferably by the spray drying method. Further, similar drying
may be conducted also in the case where wet grinding is conducted.</p><p num="0046">The oxide obtained by the above-mentioned method may be used as a final catalyst,
but it may further be subjected to heat treatment usually at a temperature of from 200¬∞ to
700¬∞C for from 0.1 to 10 hours.</p><p num="0047">The promoted mixed metal oxide thus obtained may be used by itself as a solid
catalyst, but may be formed into a catalyst together with a suitable carrier such as silica,
alumina, titania, aluminosilicate, diatomaceous earth or zirconia. Further, it may be molded
into a suitable shape and particle size depending upon the scale or system of the reactor.</p><p num="0048">Alternatively, the metal components of the presently contemplated catalyst may be
supported on materials such as alumina, silica, silica-alumina, zirconia, titania, etc. by
conventional incipient wetness techniques. In one typical method, solutions containing the
metals are contacted with the dry support such that the support is wetted; then, the resultant
wetted material is dried, for example, at a temperature from room temperature to 200¬∞C
followed by calcination as described above. In another method, metal solutions are contacted
with the support, typically in volume ratios of greater than 3 : 1 (metal solution : support),
and the solution agitated such that the metal ions are ion-exchanged onto the support. The
metal-containing support is then dried and calcined as detailed above.</p><p num="0049">In its second aspect, the present invention provides a process for producing an
unsaturated carboxylic acid, which comprises subjecting an alkane, or a mixture of an alkane 
and an alkene, to a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction in the presence of a catalyst
containing the above promoted mixed metal oxide, to produce an unsaturated carboxylic acid.</p><p num="0050">In the production of such an unsaturated carboxylic acid, it is preferred to employ a
starting material gas which contains steam. In such a case, as a starting material gas to be
supplied to the reaction system, a gas mixture comprising a steam-containing alkane, or a
steam-containing mixture of alkane and alkene, and an oxygen-containing gas, is usually
used. However, the steam-containing alkane, or the steam-containing mixture of alkane and
alkene, and the oxygen-containing gas may be alternately supplied to the reaction system.
The steam to be employed may be present in the form of steam gas in the reaction system,
and the manner of its introduction is not particularly limited.</p><p num="0051">Further, as a diluting gas, an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium may be
supplied. The molar ratio (alkane or mixture of alkane and alkene) : (oxygen) : (diluting gas):
(H<sub>2</sub>O) in the starting material gas is preferably (1): (0.1 to 10): (0 to 20): (0.2 to 70), more
preferably (1): (1 to 5.0): (0 to 10): (5 to 40).</p><p num="0052">When steam is supplied together with the alkane, or the mixture of alkane and alkene,
as starting material gas, the selectivity for an unsaturated carboxylic acid is distinctly
improved, and the unsaturated carboxylic acid can be obtained from the alkane, or mixture of
alkane and alkene, in good yield simply by contacting in one stage. However, the
conventional technique utilizes a diluting gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium for the
purpose of diluting the starting material. As such a diluting gas, to adjust the space velocity,
the oxygen partial pressure and the steam partial pressure, an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon
or helium may be used together with the steam.</p><p num="0053">As the starting material alkane it is preferred to employ a C<sub>3-8</sub>alkane, particularly
propane, isobutane or n-butane; more preferably, propane or isobutane; most preferably,
propane. According to the present invention, from such an alkane, an unsaturated carboxylic
acid such as an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carboxylic acid can be obtained in good yield. For example,
when propane or isobutane is used as the starting material alkane, acrylic acid or methacrylic
acid will be obtained, respectively, in good yield.</p><p num="0054">In the present invention, as the starting material mixture of alkane and alkene, it is
preferred to employ a mixture of C<sub>3-8</sub>alkane and C<sub>3-8</sub>alkene, particularly propane and propene,
isobutane and isobutene or n-butane and n-butene. As the starting material mixture of alkane
and alkene, propane and propene or isobutane and isobutene are more preferred. Most 
preferred is a mixture of propane and propene. According to the present invention, from such
a mixture of an alkane and an alkene, an unsaturated carboxylic acid such as an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated
carboxylic acid can be obtained in good yield. For example, when propane and
propene or isobutane and isobutene are used as the starting material mixture of alkane and
alkene, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid will be obtained, respectively, in good yield.
Preferably, in the mixture of alkane and alkene, the alkene is present in an amount of at least
0.5% by weight, more preferably at least 1.0% by weight to 95% by weight; most preferably,
3% by weight to 90% by weight.</p><p num="0055">As an alternative, an alkanol, such as isobutanol, which will dehydrate under the
reaction conditions to form its corresponding alkene, i.e. isobutene, may also be used as a
feed to the present process or in conjunction with the previously mentioned feed streams.</p><p num="0056">The purity of the starting material alkane is not particularly limited, and an alkane
containing a lower alkane such as methane or ethane, air or carbon dioxide, as impurities,
may be used without any particular problem. Further, the starting material alkane may be a
mixture of various alkanes. Similarly, the purity of the starting material mixture of alkane and

of alkane and alkene may be a mixture of various alkanes and alkenes.</p><p num="0057">There is no limitation on the source of the alkene. It may be purchased, per se, or in
admixture with an alkane and/or other impurities. Alternatively, it can be obtained as a byproduct
of alkane oxidation. Similarly, there is no limitation on the source of the alkane. It
may be purchased, per se, or in admixture with an alkene and/or other impurities. Moreover,
the alkane, regardless of source, and the alkene, regardless of source, may be blended as
desired.</p><p num="0058">The detailed mechanism of the oxidation reaction of the present invention is not
clearly understood, but the oxidation reaction is carried out by oxygen atoms present in the
above promoted mixed metal oxide or by molecular oxygen present in the feed gas. To
incorporate molecular oxygen into the feed gas, such molecular oxygen may be pure oxygen
gas. However, it is usually more economical to use an oxygen-containing gas such as air,
since purity is not particularly required. </p><p num="0059">It is also possible to use only an alkane, or a mixture of alkane and alkene,
substantially in the absence of molecular oxygen for the vapor phase catalytic reaction. In
such a case, it is preferred to adopt a method wherein a part of the catalyst is appropriately
withdrawn from the reaction zone from time to time, then sent to an oxidation regenerator,
regenerated and then returned to the reaction zone for reuse. As the regeneration method of
the catalyst, a method may, for example, be mentioned which comprises contacting an
oxidative gas such as oxygen, air or nitrogen monoxide with the catalyst in the regenerator
usually at a temperature of from 300¬∞ to 600¬∞C.</p><p num="0060">The second aspect of the present invention will be described in further detail with
respect to a case where propane is used as the starting material alkane and air is used as the
oxygen source. The reaction system may be a fixed bed system or a fluidized bed system.
However, since the reaction is an exothermic reaction, a fluidized bed system may preferably
be employed whereby it is easy to control the reaction temperature. The proportion of air to
be supplied to the reaction system is important for the selectivity for the resulting acrylic acid,
and it is usually at most 25 moles, preferably from 0.2 to 18 moles per mole of propane,
whereby high selectivity for acrylic acid can be obtained. This reaction can be conducted
usually under atmospheric pressure, but may be conducted under a slightly elevated pressure
or slightly reduced pressure. With respect to other alkanes such as isobutane, or to mixtures
of alkanes and alkenes such as propane and propene, the composition of the feed gas may be
selected in accordance with the conditions for propane.</p><p num="0061">Typical reaction conditions for the oxidation of propane or isobutane to acrylic acid or
methacrylic acid may be utilized in the practice of the present invention. The process may be
practiced in a single pass mode (only fresh feed is fed to the reactor) or in a recycle mode (at
least a portion of the reactor effluent is returned to the reactor). General conditions for the
process of the present invention are as follows: the reaction temperature can vary from 200¬∞C
to 700¬∞C, but is usually in the range of from 200¬∞C to 550¬∞C, more preferably 250¬∞C to
480¬∞C, most preferably 300¬∞C to 400¬∞C; the gas space velocity, SV, in the vapor phase
reaction is usually within a range of from 100 to 10,000 hr<sup>-1</sup>, preferably 300 to 6,000 hr<sup>-1</sup>,
more preferably 300 to 2,000 hr<sup>-1</sup> ; the average contact time with the catalyst can be from 0.01
to 10 seconds or more, but is usually in the range of from 0.1 to 10 seconds, preferably from 2
to 6 seconds; the pressure in the reaction zone usually ranges from 0 to 75 psig, but is
preferably no more than 50 psig. In a single pass mode process, it is preferred that the oxygen 
be supplied from an oxygen-containing gas such as air. The single pass mode process may
also be practiced with oxygen addition. In the practice of the recycle mode process, oxygen
gas by itself is the preferred source so as to avoid the build up of inert gases in the reaction
zone.</p><p num="0062">Of course, in the oxidation reaction of the present invention, it is important that the
hydrocarbon and oxygen concentrations in the feed gases be maintained at the appropriate
levels to minimize or avoid entering a flammable regime within the reaction zone or
especially at the outlet of the reactor zone. Generally, it is preferred that the outlet oxygen
levels be low to both minimize after-burning and, particularly, in the recycle mode of
operation, to minimize the amount of oxygen in the recycled gaseous effluent stream. In
addition, operation of the reaction at a low temperature (below 450¬∞C) is extremely attractive
because after-burning becomes less of a problem which enables the attainment of higher
selectivity to the desired products. The catalyst of the present invention operates more
efficiently at the lower temperature range set forth above, significantly reducing the formation
of acetic acid and carbon oxides, and increasing selectivity to acrylic acid. As a diluting gas
to adjust the space velocity and the oxygen partial pressure, an inert gas such as nitrogen,
argon or helium may be employed.</p><p num="0063">When the oxidation reaction of propane, and especially the oxidation reaction of
propane and propene, is conducted by the method of the present invention, carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, acetic acid, etc. may be produced as by-products, in addition to acrylic acid.
Further, in the method of the present invention, an unsaturated aldehyde may sometimes be
formed depending upon the reaction conditions. For example, when propane is present in the
starting material mixture, acrolein may be formed; and when isobutane is present in the
starting material mixture, methacrolein may be formed. In such a case, such an unsaturated
aldehyde can be converted to the desired unsaturated carboxylic acid by subjecting it again to
the vapor phase catalytic oxidation with the promoted mixed metal oxide-containing catalyst
of the present invention or by subjecting it to a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction with a
conventional oxidation reaction catalyst for an unsaturated aldehyde.</p><p num="0064">In its third aspect, the method of the present invention comprises subjecting an alkane,
or a mixture of an alkane and an alkene, to a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction with
ammonia in the presence of a catalyst containing the above mixed metal oxide, to produce an
unsaturated nitrile. </p><p num="0065">In the production of such an unsaturated nitrile, as the starting material alkane, it is
preferred to employ a C<sub>3-8</sub>alkane such as propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, hexane and
heptane. However, in view of the industrial application of nitriles to be produced, it is
preferred to employ a lower alkane having 3 or 4 carbon atoms, particularly propane and
isobutane.</p><p num="0066">Similarly, as the starting material mixture of alkane and alkene, it is preferred to
employ a mixture of C<sub>3-8</sub>alkane and C<sub>3-8</sub>alkene such as propane and propene, butane and

heptene. However, in view of the industrial application of nitriles to be produced, it is more
preferred to employ a mixture of a lower alkane having 3 or 4 carbon atoms and a lower
alkene having 3 or 4 carbon atoms, particularly propane and propene or isobutane and

invention is not clearly understood. However, the oxidation reaction is conducted by the
oxygen atoms present in the above promoted mixed metal oxide or by the molecular oxygen
in the feed gas. When molecular oxygen is incorporated in the feed gas, the oxygen may be 
pure oxygen gas. However, since high purity is not required, it is usually economical to use
an oxygen-containing gas such as air.</p><p num="0070">As the feed gas, it is possible to use a gas mixture comprising an alkane, or a mixture
of an alkane and an alkene, ammonia and an oxygen-containing gas, However, a gas mixture
comprising an alkane or a mixture of an alkane and an alkene and ammonia, and an oxygen-containing
gas may be supplied alternately.</p><p num="0071">When the gas phase catalytic reaction is conducted using an alkane, or a mixture of an
alkane and an alkene, and ammonia substantially free from molecular oxygen, as the feed gas,
it is advisable to employ a method wherein a part of the catalyst is periodically withdrawn
and sent to an oxidation regenerator for regeneration, and the regenerated catalyst is returned
to the reaction zone. As a method for regenerating the catalyst, a method may be mentioned

wherein an oxidizing gas such as oxygen, air or nitrogen monoxide is permitted to flow
through the catalyst in the regenerator usually at a temperature of from 300¬∞C to 600¬∞C.</p><p num="0072">The third aspect of the present invention will be described in further detail with
respect to a case where propane is used as the starting material alkane and air is used as the

to the selectivity for the resulting acrylonitrile. Namely, high selectivity for acrylonitrile is
obtained when air is supplied within a range of at most 25 moles, particularly 1 to 15 moles,
per mole of the propane. The proportion of ammonia to be supplied for the reaction is
preferably within a range of from 0.2 to 5 moles, particularly from 0.5 to 3 moles, per mole of
propane. This reaction may usually be conducted under atmospheric pressure, but may be
conducted under a slightly increased pressure or a slightly reduced pressure. With respect to
other alkanes such as isobutane, or to mixtures of alkanes and alkenes such as propane and
propene, the composition of the feed gas may be selected in accordance with the conditions
for propane.</p><p num="0073">The process of the third aspect of the present invention may be conducted at a
temperature of, for example, from 250¬∞C to 480¬∞C. More preferably, the temperature is from
300¬∞C to 400¬∞C. The gas space velocity, SV, in the gas phase reaction is usually within the
range of from 100 to 10,000 hr<sup>-1</sup>, preferably from 300 to 6,000 hr<sup>-1</sup>, more preferably from 300
to 2,000 hr<sup>-1</sup>. As a diluent gas, for adjusting the space velocity and the oxygen partial
pressure, an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium can be employed. When
ammoxidation of propane is conducted by the method of the present invention, in addition to 
acrylonitrile, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, acetonitrile, hydrocyanic acid and acrolein
may form as by-products.</p><heading><u style="single">Examples</u></heading><heading>Comparative Example 1</heading><p num="0074">A catalyst of nominal composition Mo<sub>1.0</sub>V<sub>0.3</sub>Te<sub>0.23</sub>Nb<sub>0.125</sub>O<sub>x</sub> was prepared in the

tetrahydrate (Aldrich Chemical Company), 5.06g of ammonium metavanadate(Alfa-Aesar)
and 7.68g of telluric acid (Aldrich Chemical Company) were dissolved upon heating to 70¬∞C.
After cooling to 40¬∞C, 122.94g of an aqueous solution of niobium oxalate (H. C. Starck)
containing 1.25% Nb to which 2.84g of oxalic acid (Aldrich Chemical Company) had been
added was mixed therewith to obtain a solution. The water of this solution was removed via a
rotary evaporator at a temperature of 50¬∞C and a pressure of 28mmHg to obtain 46g of a
precursor solid. 23g of this catalyst precursor solid was calcined in a quartz tube. (The quartz
tube was placed in an oven with a 100 cc/min flow of air through the tube, the oven was then
heated to 275¬∞C at 10¬∞C/min and held there for one hour; then using a 100 cc/min flow of
argon through the tube, the oven was heated to 600¬∞C at 2¬∞C/min and held there for two
hours.) The catalyst, thus obtained, was pressed in a mold and then broken and sieved to 10-20
mesh granules. 10g of these granules were packed into a stainless steel U-tube reactor
(inside diameter: 1.1cm) for the gas phase oxidation of propane. The U-tube reactor was
placed in a molten salt bath and fed with a mixture of propane, air and steam having a feed
ratio of propane/air/steam of 1/15/14 and having a space velocity of 1200 hr<sup>-1</sup>. The effluent of
the reactor was condensed to separate a liquid phase and a gas phase. The gas phase was
analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the propane conversion. The liquid phase was 
also analyzed by gas chromatography for the yield of acrylic acid. The results (along with
residence time and reactor temperature) are shown in Table 15.</p><heading>Example 12</heading><p num="0093">A catalyst of nominal composition Mo<sub>1.0</sub>V<sub>0.3</sub>Te<sub>0.23</sub>Nb<sub>0.08</sub>Au<sub>0.01</sub>O<sub>x</sub> was prepared in the
