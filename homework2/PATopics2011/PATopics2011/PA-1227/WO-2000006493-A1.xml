More especially it relates to processes in which synthesis mixtures are seeded to control process conditions and product characteristics. The invention relates primarily to the manufacture of phosphorus- containing molecular sieves. It is well-known that seeding a molecular sieve synthesis mixture frequently has beneficial effects, for example in controlling the particle size of the product, avoiding the need for an organic template, accelerating synthesis, and improving the proportion of product that is of the intended structure type.</p><p num="p0003">In U.S. Patent No. 4 440 871, the preparation of a number of phosphorus-containing molecular sieves is described, and it is stated that the crystallization procedure may be facilitated by stirring, or other moderate agitation of the synthesis mixture, or by seeding it with crystals of the molecular sieve to be produced or one of a topologically similar structure.</p><p num="p0004">The patent particularly describes processes for the manufacture of numerous crystalline microporous silicoaluminophosphates (SAPO's) including SAPO-34, employing sources of silicon (e.g., a silica sol), aluminium (e.g., hydrated aluminium oxide), and phosphorus (e.g., orthophosphoric acid) , and an organic template, for example tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) , isopropylamine (iPrNH<sub>2</sub>) or di-n-propylamine (DPA) . The patent, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, gives X-ray diffraction data for the SAPO's and describes their utilities in catalysis and absorption. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 It has now been found that advantages result from the use of colloidal seeds in the manufacture of phosphorus- containing molecular sieves .</p><p num="p0005">The present invention accordingly provides in a first aspect a process for the manufacture of a crystalline molecular sieve containing phosphorus in its framework, which process comprises treating a synthesis mixture comprising elements necessary to form the phosphorus-containing molecular sieve and colloidal crystalline molecular sieve seeds for a time and at a temperature appropriate to form the desired molecular sieve.</p><p num="p0006">It has surprisingly also been found that the seed crystals may be of a structure type different from that of the desired molecular sieve. Such seeding may be regarded as "heterostructural" , whereas seeding with seeds of the same structure type is termed "isostructural" , whether or not the seeds are of the same composition (i.e., contain the same elements in the same proportions) as the crystalline molecular sieve to be produced. Where the seeds are of a structure type different from those of the desired molecular sieve, advantageously the seeds and the desired molecular sieves are topologically similar, for example are members of the ABC- 6 group of materials, as described in "Topochemistry of Zeolites and Related Materials", J.V. Smith, Chem. Rev. 1988, 88, 149 at 167, the disclosure of which review article is incorporated herein by reference. The ABC-6 group includes, inter alia , the Offretite, Chabazite and Levyne structures.</p><p num="p0007">As used in this specification, the term "structure type" is used in the sense described in the Structure Type Atlas, Zeolites 17, 1996.</p><p num="p0008">The present invention accordingly provides in a second aspect a process for the manufacture of a crystalline molecular sieve containing phosphorus in its framework, which 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
comprises treating a synthesis mixture comprising elements necessary to form a phosphorus-containing molecular sieve of a first structure type and colloidal molecular sieve seed crystals of a second, different, structure type, for a time sufficient and at a temperature appropriate to form the molecular sieve of the first structure type.</p><p num="p0009">In further aspects, the invention provides the use, in the synthesis of a phosphorus-containing crystalline molecular sieve, of colloidal seed crystals to control the particle size of the product, or to accelerate the formation of the product, or both to control the particle size and accelerate the formation of the product.</p><p num="p0010">As the phosphorus-containing molecular sieves to be prepared by the processes of the invention, there may be mentioned more especially aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates. As examples of structure types produced there may be mentioned more especially molecular sieves of the structure types CHA and LEV. As seeds, there may for example be used crystals of structure type LEV, OFF, and CHA. As specific materials to be used, there may be mentioned Levyne , ZSM-45, Chabasite, Offretite and SAPO-34.</p><p num="p0011">The seeds used in the present invention may be obtained by methods described herein or known in the art or described in the literature. Manufacture of OFF-structure type seed crystals, in particular colloidal Offretite seeds, may be carried out as described in International Application No. WO 97/03020, while suitable procedures, including details of synthesis mixtures and hydrothermal treatment, for the manufacture of LEV- and CHA- structure type crystals are described in EP-A-91048, 91049, 107 370, 143 642 and U.S. Patent No. 4 495 303 (for LEV) and GB-A-868 846 and 2 061 500 and U.S. Patents Nos . 3 030 181 and 4 544 538 (for CHA) , the disclosures of all of which are incorporated by reference herein. Manufacture of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
CHA- and LEV-structure type seed crystals is advantageously carried out as described in the examples below.</p><p num="p0012">Apart from the presence of the seeds, the synthesis mixture used in the present invention is typically one that is known in the art or as described in the literature as suitable for the production of the molecular sieve concerned. This is also the case for the conditions of treatment, except that the presence of the seeds may make possible the reduction of reaction times or may obviate stirring if that were otherwise necessary.</p><p num="p0013">In general, the treatment of the synthesis mixture to yield the desired phosphorus-containing crystalline molecular sieve, usually termed hydrothermal treatment, though strictly that term should be used only for treatments in which there is vapour-phase water present, is advantageously carried out under autogenous pressure, for example in an autoclave, for example a stainless steel autoclave which may, if desired, be ptfe-lined. The treatment may, for example, be carried out at a temperature within the range of from 50, advantageously from 90, especially 120, to 250°C, depending on the molecular sieve being made. The treatment may, for example, be carried out for a period within the range of from 20 to 200 hours, preferably up to 100 hours, again depending on the molecular sieve being formed. The procedure may include an ageing period, either at room temperature or, preferably, at a moderately elevated temperature, before the hydrothermal treatment at more elevated temperature. The latter may include a period of gradual or stepwise variation in temperature . For certain applications, the treatment is carried out with stirring or with rotating the vessel about a horizontal axis (tumbling) . For other applications, static hydrothermal treatment is preferred. If desired, the synthesis mixture may be stirred or tumbled during an initial 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
part of the heating stage, for example, from room temperature to an elevated, e.g., the final treatment, temperature, and be static for the remainder. Agitation generally produces a product with a smaller particle size and a narrower particle size distribution than static hydrothermal treatment.</p><p num="p0014">The seeds are generally present in the synthesis mixture in a concentration of up to 10000, advantageously at most 3000, more advantageously at most 1500, and preferably at most 1000, more preferably at most 500, and most preferably at most 350 ppm, based on the total weight of the synthesis mixture. A minimum seeding level is generally 1 ppb (0.001 ppm), advantageously at least 0.1, more advantageously at least 1, and preferably at least 10, ppm, based on the total weight of the synthesis mixture. Advantageous ranges of proportions are from 1 to 2000, preferably 100 to 1500, and most preferably 100 to 250, ppm.</p><p num="p0015">The colloidal seeds are advantageously incorporated in the synthesis mixture in the form of a suspension, advantageously in an aqueous medium, preferably water, or another liquid component of the synthesis mixture. Less preferably they may be added in dry, but not calcined, form. It is believed that calcination significantly reduces the activity of small crystallites to act as seeds; similarly any other treatment that reduces the seeding activity of materials should be avoided. As used herein, the term "colloidal", when used of a suspension, refers to one containing discrete finely divided particles dispersed in a continuous liquid phase and preferably refers to a suspension that is stable, in the sense that no visible separation occurs or sediment forms, in a period sufficient for the use intended, advantageously for at least 10, more advantageously at least 20, preferably at least 100, and more preferably at least 500, hours at ambient temperature (23°C) . 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 The maximum size of the particles for the suspension to remain stable (peptized) will depend to some extent on their shape, on the nature and pH of the continuous medium, as well as on the period during which the suspension must remain usable. In general, the maximum dimension will be lμm, advantageously 500, more advantageously 400, preferably 300, more preferably 200, and most preferably 100, nm. The particles may be of spherical, columnar, rod, coffin, platelet, or needle shapes. Where particles are platelets or needles, the dimension referred to is their smallest dimension.</p><p num="p0016">The minimum dimension is such that the particles do not dissolve or re-dissolve in the medium, and for crystallinity they must contain at least a small plurality, advantageously at least two, preferably four, unit cells of the crystal.</p><p num="p0017">The minimum particle size is in general 5, advantageously 10, and preferably 20, nm. Mean particle sizes are generally in the range 5 to 1000, advantageously 10 to 300, more advantageously 10 to 200, and preferably 20 to 100, nm. Advantageously at least 50%, more advantageously at least 80%, and more preferably at least 95%, by number, of the particles are greater than the given minima, smaller than the given maxima, or within the given ranges of particle size. Measurements of particle size may be effected by electron microscopy, for example using a Philips SEM 515 unit.</p><p num="p0018">If the product is desired in small particle size form, a larger number of smaller sized seeds is desirably employed. The smaller the particle size of the seeds, the lower the weight percentage that is effective. The crystals are advantageously stirred into the synthesis mixture for a time sufficient to provide a uniform dispersion, this time being dependent primarily on the viscosity of the synthesis mixture, and also on the scale and type of the equipment, but ranging generally from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 More especially, the invention provides processes and uses in which colloidal LEV structure type seeds are used in the manufacture of a phosphorus-containing crystalline molecular sieve. A colloidal suspension of LEV may be obtained by synthesizing a LEV structure type molecular sieve by hydrothermal treatment of an appropriate synthesis mixture, and separating the product from the synthesis mixture, washing the product, and recovering the resulting wash liquid.</p><p num="p0019">Examples of the LEV structure type include Levyne, NU-3, ZK-20, ZSM-45 and SAPO-35.</p><p num="p0020">The colloidal LEV seeds are especially suitable to provide crystalline molecular sieves of the CHA structure type. Examples of such CHA materials are SAPO- , A1PO- , MeAPO-, MeAPSO-, ElAPSO- and ElAPO -47 and especially the corresponding -34 materials. In these formulae, El represents magnesium, zinc, iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, chromium or mixtures of any two or more such elements. CHA structure type seeds may also be used in synthesis of these materials. LEV and CHA structure type seeds may be used in the synthesis of SAPO-, A1PO- , MeAPO-, MeAPSO-, ElAPSO- and ElAPO- materials of the LEV structure type, e.g., the -35 materials. Where a material is referred to as, for example, a SAPO material, this terminology includes the possibility that additional elements may be present, either in the framework or otherwise, as in the case discussed below, of Ni-SAPO.</p><p num="p0021">Among these materials, SAPO-34 has been found to have considerable utility in catalysing the conversion of methanol to light olefins, primarily those with 2 to 4 carbon atoms (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5 126 308, also incorporated by reference herein) . It would be of value to be able to increase the proportion of ethylene in the product .

 The present invention accordingly also provides a process for the manufacture of SAPO-34 in which the percentage area contribution of Broensted acid sites to the total OH area in the IR spectrum is at least 30%, advantageously at least 50%, and preferably at least 60%, by a procedure in which the synthesis mixture contains colloidal crystalline molecular sieve crystals. In certain embodiments, percentage area contribution is at most 95%.</p><p num="p0022">More especially, the invention further provides a process for the manufacture of SAPO-34, which comprises treating a synthesis mixture having a molar composition appropriate for SAPO-34 formation and also containing colloidal OFF-type, CHA-type, or LEV-type seed crystals, advantageously of mean particle size of at most 400 nm, for a time and at a temperature sufficient to form SAPO-34.</p><p num="p0023">The process of the invention is capable of providing SAPO-34 in which the particle size is at most 0.75 μm, advantageously at most 0.5 μm. Advantageously the particle size distribution is such that 80 % (by number) of the particles are within ±10 % of the mean.</p><p num="p0024">In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the conversion of an oxygenate, especially methanol, to olefins which comprises contacting the oxygenate with a catalyst under conversion conditions, the catalyst comprising SAPO-34 produced in accordance with the invention.</p><p num="p0025">The olefins produced are advantageously light olefins, by which is to be understood an olefin mixture of which at least 50% by weight contain from 2 to 4 carbon atoms.</p><p num="p0026">Referring now more especially to the Broensted acid site aspect of the invention, it is believed (without the invention being limited by any theoretical considerations) that the Broensted acidity is important in the catalytic activity, especially in oxygenate to olefin conversion, of a molecular sieve, and that a molecular sieve in which the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
bridged hydroxyl groups represent a high proportion of the hydroxyl groups in the crystal will have a high activity. Infra-red analysis of a highly active product of the invention (described as are the methods of measurement in more detail in the Examples below) shows that in the SAPO-34 OH region, 4000 to 3000 cm<sup>"1</sup>, two peaks, at -3620 and -3595 cm<sup>"1</sup>, are the main features, while less active samples show a number of bands in the range from 3750 to 3620 cm<sup>"1</sup>, which are assigned to Al-OH, Si -OH, and P-OH groups on an external surface or on an internal defect.</p><p num="p0027">A further IR spectrum characteristic associated with catalytic activity is a high peak intensity in the T-0 asymmetric stretch region, at 1050 to 1150 cm<sup>"1</sup>, intensity being indicated by both height and sharpness, i.e., a high level of internal crystallinity. It is accordingly believed that a correlation exists between high internal crystallinity, or crystal perfection, and a high contribution of Broensted OH groups to the total OH content of the material . Further, in common with many other molecular sieves, the catalytic activity and stability of activity of SAPO-34 are in general terms greater the smaller the particle size.</p><p num="p0028">The synthesis mixture for producing SAPO-34 according to the invention advantageously has a molar composition, apart from the colloidal seeds, within the following ranges:</p><p num="p0029">P<sub>2</sub>0<sub>5</sub> : A1<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> 0.9 to 1.2 : 1</p><p num="p0030">Si0<sub>2</sub> : A1<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> 0.05 to 0.4 : 1</p><p num="p0031">H<sub>2</sub>0 : A1<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> 10 to 100</p><p num="p0032">together with an organic template, advantageously tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) , dipropylamine (DPA) , isopropylamine or morpholine, or a mixture of two or more

such templates, in a proportion appropriate to yield SAPO-34. A preferred template mixture comprises TEAOH and DPA. In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention the synthesis mixture advantageously contains a source of metallic elements, especially a Group VIII metal, more especially nickel. A convenient source of the metal is a water-soluble salt, for example the nitrate. The metal is advantageously present in a molar proportion calculated as oxide relative to Al<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> within the range of 0.001 to 0.05, preferably 0.005 to 0.01. The presence of nickel enhances the catalytic activity at least in oxygenate conversion. Other suitable Group VIII metals include Fe and Co, while other suitable metals include Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mg, Ti and Zr.</p><p num="p0033">The sources of the materials may be any of those in commercial use or described in the literature, as may the preparation of the synthesis mixture.</p><p num="p0034">The invention also provides the products of the processes and of the uses of the earlier aspects of the invention. The products, if required after cation exchange and/or calcining, have utility as catalyst precursors, catalysts, and separation and absorption media. They are especially useful in numerous hydrocarbon conversions, separations and absorptions. They may be used alone, or in admixture with other molecular sieves, in particulate form, supported or unsupported, or in the form of a supported layer, for example in the form of a membrane, for example as described in International Application WO 94/25151. Hydrocarbon conversions include, for example, cracking, reforming, hydrofining, aromatization, oligomerisation, isomerization, dewaxing, and hydrocracking (e.g., naphtha to light olefins, higher to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, alkylation, transalkylation, disproportionation or isomerization of aromatics) .

When carried out in continuous mode, a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) based on oxygenate, of advantageously 1 to 1000, preferably 1 to 100, hour<sup>"1</sup> may conveniently be used. An elevated temperature is generally required to obtain economic conversion rates, e.g., one between 300 and 600°C, preferably from 400 to 500°C, and more preferably about 450°C. The catalyst may be in a fixed bed, or a dynamic, e.g., fluidized or moving, bed.</p><p num="p0036">The oxygenate feedstock may be mixed with a diluent, inert under the reaction conditions, e.g., argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, or steam. The concentration of methanol in the feedstream may vary widely, e.g., from 5 to 90 mole per cent of the feedstock. The pressure may vary within a wide range, e.g., from atmospheric to 500 kPa.
