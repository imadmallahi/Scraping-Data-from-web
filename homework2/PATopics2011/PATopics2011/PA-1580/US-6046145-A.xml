The compositions are especially useful for cleansing the skin and hair of infants and young children and adults with sensitive skin and eyes.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Cleansing surfactant compositions are designed to remove accumulated soil and oils from the skin and hair. Unfortunately, these compositions often exhibit a number of drawbacks. The first of these is that upon total removal of skin and hair oils, the skin and hair are made to feel excessively and uncomfortably dry. The second drawback with many cleansing compositions is that the surfactants or other components of the composition contain ingredients that are irritating to the eyes, which is especially troublesome when the products are used on infants, children and adults with sensitive eyes and skin.</p><p>One method used by the cosmetics and toiletries industry to overcome the problem of dryness is to add moisturizers to the cleansing product. Unfortunately, this method often provides a product which leaves the body with an excessively oily and slippery residue when the composition is washed from the body. Furthermore, even starting with a surfactant base that has a low degree of eye irritation, the presence of added components such as moisturizers can upset the ocular mildness of the overall formulation. The presence of moisturizers in surfactant compositions also has a tendency to reduce the dispersibility and foamability of the composition, which negatively impacts the consumer acceptance of the product. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a cleansing composition that is exceedingly mild to the skin and to the eyes. It is another object of this invention to provide a cleansing composition that does not leave the skin with an excessively dry feeling. It is another object of this invention to provide a cleansing composition that leaves the skin and hair feeling moist but without feeling excessively oily and slippery. It is another object of this invention to provide a moisturizing cleansing composition which does not leave a slippery and oily residue on bath surfaces. It is another object of the invention to provide a moisturizing cleansing composition that is not adversely affected as to the attributes of dispersibility and foamability.</p><p>Finally, it is an object of this invention to provide a cleansing composition with the combination of attributes of mildness to the skin and eyes and effective cleansing, while leaving the skin with a feel that is neither excessively dry nor oily.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention relates to cleansing surfactant compositions which cleanse, condition and moisturize the skin and hair and which exhibit a low degree of irritation to the eyes. Skin and hair cleansing surfactant compositions of this invention clean the skin and hair without imparting a feeling of excessive dryness or oiliness. The compositions are especially useful for cleansing the skin and hair of infants and young children and adults with sensitive skin and eyes. The compositions of the present invention achieve their properties as a result of specific combinations of surfactants and substantive humectants which result in excellent cleansing without imparting a feeling of excessive dryness or oiliness to the skin and hair. The compositions of the present invention achieve these cleansing and moisturizing benefits while being relatively non-irritating to the eyes. The cleansing compositions of the present invention preferably contain the following components:</p><p>a. a surfactant portion containing:</p><p>1. a nonionic surfactant;</p><p>2. an amphoteric surfactant; and</p><p>3. an anionic surfactant;</p><p>the total concentration of said nonionic, amphoteric and anionic surfactants being present in the composition in an amount from about 5 to about 20 percent by weight of said cleansing composition; and</p><p>b. a substantive humectant present in the composition in an amount from abut 0.01 to about 3 percent by weight of said cleansing composition.</p><p>The substantive humectant used in the present invention is cationically charged, thereby being capable of binding to the negatively charged sites on the skin and the hair. The negatively charged sites on skin and hair attract the positively charged humectant molecules, promoting a moist feeling on skin and hair cleaned with the composition of the present invention. The moisturized feeling is retained even after the cleansing composition is rinsed off, and this feeling is maintained for extended periods of time. Furthermore, this cleansed and moisturized feeling is achieved without the oily feel provided by conventional moisturizing agents. Despite the fact that additives to surfactant compositions often upset the ocular mildness of such formulations, the cleansing compositions of the present invention surprisingly retain their ocular mildness in the presence of the substantive humectants used in the compositions of the present invention. The substantive humectants used in the present invention are preferably cationically charged polyols. Preferred humectants are derived from sugars or sugar derivatives. More preferably, the cationic polyol is an alkoxylated derivative of methyl glucoside. Most preferably, the humectants used in the compositions of the present invention further comprise a long chain alkyl or alkenyl group having from 6 to 22 carbon atoms.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p>FIG. 1 shows the capacitance of skin as measured after treatment with the cleansing and moisturizing surfactant compositions of the present invention.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>The cleansing compositions of the present invention comprise, consist essentially of, and/or consist of the following components:</p><p>a. a surfactant portion containing:</p><p>1. a nonionic surfactant;</p><p>2. an amphoteric surfactant; and</p><p>3. an anionic surfactant;</p><p>the total concentration of said nonionic, amphoteric and anionic surfactants being present in the composition in an amount from about 5 to about 20 percent by weight of said cleansing composition; and</p><p>b. a substantive humectant present in the composition in an amount from about 0.01 to about 3, and preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.5 percent by weight of said cleansing composition.</p><p>The nonionic surfactant material is preferably selected from the following materials and may be composed of one or more of the following: (a) polyoxyethylene derivatives of polyol esters, wherein (1) the polyoxyethylene derivative of polyol ester is derived from a polyol selected from the following group: sorbitol, sorbitan, glucose, α-methyl glucoside, polyglucose having an average of about 1.1 to about 3 glucose residues, glycerine, pentaerythritol and mixtures thereof; (2) the polyoxyethylene derivative of polyol ester contains from about 10 to about 120 oxyethylene units; (3) the polyoxyethylene derivative of polyol ester is derived from a fatty acid containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms; and (4) the polyoxyethylene derivative of polyol ester has from 1 to 2 fatty acid residues per mole of polyoxyethylene derivative of polyol ester; (b) an alkyl polyglucoside; and mixtures thereof.</p><p>The nonionic surfactant should be present in the cleansing composition in an amount of about 1 to about 10 weight percent of the composition.</p><p>The compositions of the present invention also contain an amphoteric surfactant.

For example, aloe vera gel, the mucilage obtained as the juice expressed from the leaves of the Aloe barbadensis Miller plant, is generally believed to soothe irritated skin, and may be advantageously added to the compositions of this invention. One source of aloe vera gel is Aloe-Con UP-40, a 40-fold aloe vera gel concentrate available from Florida Food Products of Eustis, Fla. Due to its concentrated state, the addition of one part of this concentrate to formulation is equivalent to adding 40 parts of aloe vera gel to the formulation. Similarly, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are attributed to vitamin E and its derivatives, which may be also beneficially added to compositions of this invention.</p><p>The compositions of this invention may also contain additives which enhance their appearance, feel and fragrance, such as colorants, fragrances, preservatives and pH adjusting agents. Chelating agents such as EDTA are also helpful in protecting and preserving the compositions of this invention.

The temperature is then cooled to below 110 is continued until the premix is uniform.</p><p>Main compounding step</p><p>Component amounts in this procedure are given in terms of parts by weight to prepare 100 parts of the cleansing composition of Example 1. 27.6 parts water are heated to 145 to 150 6000 distearate are added with agitation until all of the PEG 6000 distearate has dissolved. 1.0 parts Glucquat 125 is added with continued agitation until a uniform mixture is obtained.

The pH of the composition is adjusted with a 20% citric acid solution until a final pH of 6.8 to 7.2 is obtained.</p><p>The degree of moisturization imparted by a moisturizing cleanser can be assessed by measuring the amount of water on the skin surface following the use of the moisturizing cleanser. The water content of the skin has been shown to be related to the skin's electrical properties. The measurement of impedance of the skin (the total electrical resistance of the skin to an alternating current) has been studied extensively and has been widely used to assess the hydration state of the skin's surface (J. Serup and G. B. E. Jemec in Handbook of Non-Invasive Methods for the Skin, CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, Fla., 1995, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Skin surface capacitance measurements were made with a Nova Technology Corp. Model 9003 dermal phase meter (DPM) equipped with a DPM 9103 remote sensor probe (Nova Technology Corporation, Gloucester, Mass.). This device emits a 1 Mhz span of simultaneously produced frequencies, producing a differential current source using a controlled rise time. The sensor probe has 2 concentric brass electrodes which are separated by a non-conducting resin. The DPM measures and reports capacitance values at several frequencies from the signal-phase delay data. The capacitance readings are directly related to picoFarads (pF) of capacitance in the volume of skin that is effectively measured. Conductance and capacitance have been shown to correlate to skin water content in vivo and the capacitance values delivered by the instrument are representative of the hydration state of the upper stratum corneum, i.e., the upper layers of the skin (P. Treffel and B. Gabard, "Stratum Corneum dynamic Functional Measurements after Moisturizer or Irritant Application", Arch. Dermatol. Res., 287, 474-479, 1995 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference).</p><p>The following test protocol was used to make skin moisture measurements. Subjects who had applied lotions or oils to their skin since their last cleansing were asked to wash both volar forearms with a cleansing bar soap and to rinse and dry their forearms. Baseline readings were taken in four places within a 4 to treatment with the compositions of this invention. Both forearms of each subject were moistened with warm (approximately 38 water. 0.5 ml of the composition of Example 1 was applied to the treatment area on one forearm of each subject over a one minute period and subsequently left in place for three minutes while the untreated arm, moistened with water, served as a control. Both arms were then simultaneously rinsed in separate buckets of warm water for 30 seconds. The arms were then air dried for five minutes. Four readings were then taken on each forearm at three succeeding five-minute intervals following the rinse step, i.e., at 5, 10 and 15 minutes following rinsing, with the probe being wiped between arm changes. Average values were calculated for each arm at each time interval.</p><p>The results of these measurements are shown in FIG. 1. Data points represented by triangles, diamonds and squares in FIG. 1 are for baseline measurements, control measurements and measurements after exposure to the composition of Example 1, respectively. It is evident from FIG. 1 that the capacitance, and hence the moisture content of the skin in areas treated with the composition of this invention was significantly higher than the moisture content of the skin in the control area treated with water only. In contrast, the water treated areas showed no significant increase in moisture relative to the baseline values. The increase in moisturization in the treated areas vs. the control was statistically significant at the 99% confidence level after 5 and 10 minutes, and significant at the 95% confidence level after 15 minutes.</p><p>The compositions of this invention also exhibit very low irritation to the eyes and skin. Irritation has been measured in accordance with the Invittox Protocol Number 86, the "Trans-epithelial Permeability (TEP) Assay". In accordance with the TEP Assay, the ocular irritation potential of a product can be evaluated by determining its effect on the permeability of a cell layer, as assessed by the leakage of fluorescein through the layer. In accordance with this in vitro method, monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are grown to confluence on microporous inserts in a 24-well plate containing medium or assay buffer in the lower wells. The irritation potential of a product is evaluated by measuring the damage to the permeability barrier in the cell monolayer following a 15 minute exposure to dilutions of the product. Barrier damage is assessed by the amount of sodium fluorescein that has leaked through to the lower well after 30 minutes, as determined by spectrophotometry. The fluorescein leakage is plotted against the concentration of test material to determine the EC.sub.50 (the concentration of test material that causes 50% of maximum dye leakage, i.e., 50% damage to the permeability barrier). The test procedure is set forth in Invittox Protocol Number 86 (May 1994), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p>Exposure of a layer of MDCK cells grown on a microporous membrane to test sample is a model for the first event that occurs when an irritant comes in contact with the eye. In vivo, the outermost layers of the corneal epithelium form a selectively permeable barrier due to the presence of tight junctions between cells. On exposure to an irritant, the tight junctions separate, removing the permeability barrier. Fluid is imbibed to the underlying layers of epithelium and to the stroma, causing the collagen lamellae to separate, resulting in opacity. The TEP assay measures the effect of an irritant on the breakdown of tight junctions between cells in a layer of MDCK cells grown on a microporous insert. Damage is evaluated spectrophotometrically, by measuring the amount of marker dye (sodium fluorescein) that leaks through the cell layer and microporous membrane to the lower well. Generally, a passing score is reflected in an EC.sub.50 of 2.2 or higher. The composition of Example 1 made in accordance with the present invention had a passing TEP score of 2.98.+-48. In contrast, the composition of Comparative Example 1, which contained, among other ingredients, a cationic silicone (i.e., Quaternium 80) but did not include the cationic polyol i.e., Glucquat 125, used in the compositions of the present invention, scored a failing TEP score of 1.73. These data demonstrate the critical effect of the formulation components on TEP and hence eye irritation, and demonstrate that the compositions of the present invention are exceptionally mild to the eyes.</p><heading>EXAMPLES 2-9</heading><p>Cleansing compositions having the formulations set forth in Tables 2 and 3 are made in accordance with the procedure of Example 1.</p><p>These compositions are effective for cleansing, conditioning, and moisturizing skin and hair without ocular irritation.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What is claimed is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
