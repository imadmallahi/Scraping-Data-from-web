and comprises:
<sl><li>(A) oil of lubricating viscosity;</li><li>(B) a salicylate detergent having a TBN of 250 or less;</li><li>(C) a detergent having a TBN of greater than 250;</li><li>(D) an ashless dispersant; and</li><li>(E) an anti-wear additive;</li></sl></p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">This invention relates to gas-fuelled engine lubrication.</p><p num="0002">Gas-fuelled engines, sometimes referred to as gas-fired engines or merely gas
engines, are known and may be used in the oil and gas industry, for example to
drive pumping stations of natural gas pipelines, blowers and generators in
purification plants and on gas tankers; and to compress natural gas at well heads
and along pipe lines. Their design may be two- or four-stroke, spark-ignited or
compression-ignited, though four-stroke compression-ignited designs constitute a
large percentage. Natural gas constitutes a typical fuel.</p><p num="0003">Problems in their lubrication are firstly, that the lubricant is subjected to sustained
high temperatures leading to its oxidation, and secondly, that the engines emit
relatively high quantities of oxides of nitrogen, leading to nitration of the lubricant.
These problems reduce the working life of the lubricant.</p><p num="0004">US-A-5 726 133 describes a way of meeting the above problems by using, in a
natural gas engine oil, an additive mixture comprising a mixture of detergents
comprising at least one first alkali or alkaline earth metal salt or mixture thereof of
TBN of 250 and less, and at least one second alkali or alkaline earth metal salt or
mixture thereof which is more neutral than the first salt.</p><p num="0005">EP-A-0 860 495 describes a lubricating oil composition stated to be excellent for
NOx oxidation resistance and thermal oxidation resistance and suitable as a long-life
engine oil for gas engine heat pumps. The composition includes a metal
salicylate having a TBN of from 100 to 195, and optionally includes a metal
phenate having a TBN of from 100 to 300.</p><p num="0006">There is, however, a desire to further improve the lubricant performance in the
above respects, for example to enable the interval between lubricant changes to
be extended. </p><p num="0007">The present invention meets this desire, as evidenced by and in the examples
hereof, by using, as a first detergent, one only salicylate having a TBN of 95 or
less and a second detergent having a TBN of greater than 250.</p><p num="0008">Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention is a gas-fuelled engine
lubricating oil composition having a TBN in the range of 2 to 20 comprising:
<sl><li>(A) an oil of lubricating viscosity, in a major amount; and added thereto, in
respective minor amounts:</li><li>(B) one only metal hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylate detergent having a
TBN of 95 or less;</li><li>(C) one or more metal detergents such as a
salicylate, sulfonate, or phenate, having a TBN of greater than 250;</li><li>(D) one or more dispersants, such as an ashless dispersant; and</li><li>(E) one or more anti-wear additives;</li></sl></p><p num="0009">A second aspect of the present invention is a method of lubricating a gas-fuelled
internal combustion engine comprising operating the engine and lubricating it with
a composition according to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p num="0010">A third aspect of the present invention is a method for enhancing the resistance of
a gas-fuelled lubricating oil composition to oxidation and nitration comprising
providing the composition with additives (B) to (E) as defined in the first aspect of
the invention.</p><p num="0011">"Major amount" means in excess of 50 mass % of the composition.</p><p num="0012">"Minor amount" means less than 50 mass % of the composition, both in respect of
the stated additive and in respect of the total mass % of all the additives present in
composition, reckoned as active ingredient of the additive or additives.</p><p num="0013">"Comprises or comprising" or cognate words is taken to specify the presence of
stated features, steps, integers or components, but does not preclude the 
presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, integer components or
groups thereof.</p><p num="0014">"TBN" (Total Base Number) is as measured by ASTM D2896.</p> <p num="0015">Unless otherwise started, all proportions are expressed as mass % active
ingredient, i.e. as if solvent or diluent or other inert material were absent.</p><p num="0016">The features of the invention will now be discussed in more detail below.</p><heading><u style="single">Lubricating Oil Composition</u></heading><p num="0017">Preferably, the TBN of the lubricant composition is in the range of from 6 to 20,
such as from 6.5 to 20.</p> <heading><u style="single">(A) Oil of Lubricating Viscosity</u> </heading> <p num="0018">The oil of lubricating viscosity (sometimes referred to as lubricating oil) may be any
oil suitable for the lubrication of a gas-fuelled engine. The lubricating oil may
suitably be an animal, a vegetable or a mineral oil. Suitably the lubricating oil is a
petroleum-derived lubricating oil, such as a naphthenic base, paraffinic base or
mixed base oil. Alternatively, the lubricating oil may be a synthetic lubricating oil.
Suitable synthetic lubricating oils include synthetic ester lubricating oils, which oils
include diesters such as di-octyl adipate, di-octyl sebacate and tridecyl adipate, or
polymeric hydrocarbon lubricating oils, for example liquid polyisobutene and polyalpha
olefins. Commonly, a mineral oil is employed. The lubricating oil may
generally comprise greater than 60, typically greater than 70, mass % of the
composition, and typically have a kinematic viscosity at 100°C of from 2 to 40, for
example for 3 to 15, mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and a viscosity index of from 80 to 100, for example
from 90 to 95.</p><p num="0019">Another class of lubricating oils is hydrocracked oils, where the refining process
further breaks down the middle and heavy distillate fractions in the presence of
hydrogen at high temperatures and moderate pressures. Hydrocracked oils
typically have a kinematic viscosity at 100°C of from 2 to 40, for example from 3 to
15, mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and a viscosity index typically in the range of from 100 to 110, for
example from 105 to 108. </p><p num="0020">The oil may include 'brightstock' which refers to base oils which are solventextracted,
de-asphalted products from vacuum residuum generally having a
kinematic viscosity at 100°C of from 28 to 36 mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and are typically used in a
proportion of less than 30, preferably less than 20, more preferably less than 15,
most preferably less than 10, such as less than 5, mass %, based on the mass of
the composition.</p><heading><u style="single">(B) Salicylate Detergent</u></heading><p num="0021">A detergent is an additive that reduces formation of piston deposits, for example
high-temperature varnish and lacquer deposits, in engines; it has acid-neutralising
properties and is capable of keeping finely divided solids in suspension. It is
based on metal "soaps", that is metal salts of acidic organic compounds,
sometimes referred to as surfactants, which, in respect of (B), is salicylic acid.</p><p num="0022">The detergent comprises a polar head with a long hydrophobic tail, the polar head
comprises a metal salt of the salicylic acid. Large amounts of a metal base are
included by reacting an excess of a metal compound, such as an oxide or
hydroxide, with an acidic gas such as carbon dioxide to give an overbased
detergent which comprises neutralised detergent as the outer layer of a metal
base (e.g. carbonate) micelle.</p><p num="0023">The metal may be an alkali or alkaline earth metal, e.g., sodium, potassium,
lithium, calcium, and magnesium. Calcium is preferred.</p><p num="0024">Surfactants for the surfactant system of the overbased metal detergents contain at
least one hydrocarbyl group, for example, as a substituent on an aromatic ring.
The term "hydrocarbyl" as used herein means that the group concerned is
primarily composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms and is bonded to the
remainder of the molecule via a carbon atom, but does not exclude the presence
of other atoms or groups in a proportion insufficient to detract from the
substantially hydrocarbon characteristics of the group. Advantageously,
hydrocarbyl groups in surfactants for use in accordance with the invention are
aliphatic groups, preferably alkyl or alkylene groups, especially alkyl groups, which
may be linear or branched. The total number of carbon atoms in the surfactants
should be at least sufficient to impact the desired oil-solubility. </p><p num="0025">The salicylates may be non-sulfurized or sulfurized, and may be chemically
modified and/or contain additional substitutents. Processes for sulfurizing a
hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylic acid are well known to those skilled in the art.
Salicylic acids are typically prepared by the carboxylation, by the Kolbe-Schmitt
process, of phenoxides, and in that case, will generally be obtained, normally in a
diluent, in admixture with uncarboxylated phenol.</p><p num="0026">Preferred substituents in oil-soluble salicylic acids from which the salicylates may
be derived are alkyl substituents. In alkyl-substituted salicylic acids, the alkyl
groups advantageously contain 5 to 100, preferably 9 to 30, especially 14 to 20,
carbon atoms. Where there are more than one alkyl groups, the average number
of carbon atoms in all of the alkyl groups is preferably at least 9 to ensure
adequate oil-solubility.</p><p num="0027">The salicylates may be used in a proportion in the range of 0.5 to 30, preferably 2
to 15 or to 20, mass % based on the mass of the lubricating oil composition.</p><heading>(C) <u style="single">Metal Detergents having a TBN greater than 250</u></heading><p num="0028">The surfactants that may be used include salicylates, sulfonate, phenates,
sulfurized phenates, thiophosphates, naphthenates, and oil-soluble carboxylates.
The metal may be an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal such as sodium,
potassium, lithium, calcium and magnesium. Calcium is preferred.</p><p num="0029">The detergent may, for example, be a complex detergent comprising an
overbased mixture of more than one metal surfactants, such as a calcium alkyl
phenate and a calcium alkyl salicylate. Such a complex detergent is a hybrid
material in which the surfactant groups, eg phenate and salicylate, are
incorporated during the overbasing process. Examples of complex detergents are
described in the art.</p><p num="0030">Another example of a detergent that may be used comprises a sulfurized and
then overbased mixture of a calcium alkyl phenate and a calcium alkyl salicylate
such as described in EP-A-750,659, for example as: <sl><li>a detergent-dispersant additive for lubricating oil of the sulfurised and
superalkalinised, alkaline earth alkylsalicylate-alkylphenate type, characterised in
that:
<sl><li>(a) the alkyl substituents of the said alkylsalicylate-alkylphenate are in a
proportion of at least 35 wt.% and at most 85 wt.% of linear alkyl in
which the number of carbon atoms is between 12 and 40, preferably
between 18 and 30 carbon atoms, with a maximum of 65 wt.% of
branched alkyl in which the number of carbon atoms is between 9 and
24 and preferably 12 carbon atoms;</li><li>(b) the proportion of alkylsalicylate in the alkylsalicylate-alkylphenate
mixture is at least 22 mole % and preferably at least 25 mole %, and</li><li>(c) the molar proportion of alkaline in the alkylsalicylate-alkylphenate as a
whole is between 1.0 and 3.5.</li></sl></li></sl></p><p num="0031">Preferably, the metal detergents (C) have a TBN in the range of 250 to 500,
more preferably 250 to 400.</p><heading>(D) <u style="single">Dispersants</u></heading><p num="0032">A dispersant is an additive for a lubricating composition whose primary function is
to hold solid and liquid contaminants in suspension, thereby passivating them and
reducing engine deposits at the same time as reducing sludge depositions. Thus,
for example, a dispersant maintains in suspension oil-insoluble substances that
result from oxidation during use of the lubricating oil, thus preventing sludge
flocculation and precipitation or deposition on metal parts of the engine.</p><p num="0033">A noteworthy class of dispersants are "ashless", meaning a non-metallic organic
material that forms substantially no ash on combustion, in contrast to metal-containing,
hence ash-forming, materials. Ashless dispersants comprise a long
chain hydrocarbon with a polar head, the polarity being derived from inclusion of,
e.g. an O, P or N atom. The hydrocarbon is an oleophilic group that confers oil-solubility,
having for example 40 to 500 carbon atoms. Thus, ashless dispersants 
may comprise an oil-soluble polymeric hydrocarbon backbone having functional
groups that are capable of associating with particles to be dispersed.</p><p num="0034">Examples of ashless dispersants are succinimides, eg polyisobutene succinic
anhydride: polyamine condensation products which may be borated or unborated.</p><heading>(E) <u style="single">Antiwear Additive</u></heading><p num="0035">The antiwear additives may be metallic or non-metallic, preferably the former.</p><p num="0036">Dihydrocarbly dithiophosphate metal salts are examples of the anti-wear additives
used in the present invention. The metal in the dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphate
metal may be an alkali or alkaline earth metal, or aluminium, lead, tin,
molybdenum, manganese, nickel or copper. Zinc salts are preferred, preferably in
the range of 0.1 to 1.5, preferably 0.5 to 1.3, mass %, based upon the total mass
of the lubricating oil composition. They may be prepared in accordance with
known techniques by firstly forming a dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphoric acid (DDPA),
usually by reaction of one or more alcohols or a phenol with P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> and then
neutralizing the formed DDPA with a zinc compound. For example, a
dithiophosphoric acid may be made by reacting mixtures of primary and secondary
alcohols. Alternatively, multiple dithiophosphoric acids can be prepared
comprising both hydrocarbyl groups that are entirely secondary and hydrocarbyl
groups that are entirely primary. To make the zinc salt, any basic or neutral zinc
compound may be used but the oxides, hydroxides and carbonates are most
generally employed. Commercial additives frequently contain an excess of zinc
due to use of an excess of the basic zinc compound in the neutralisation reaction.</p><p num="0037">The preferred zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphates are oil-soluble salts of
dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphoric acids and may be represented by the following
formula:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">[(RO) (R<sup>1</sup>O) P(S)S]<sub>2</sub> Zn</st32:che>
where R and R<sup>1</sup> may be the same or different hydrocarbyl radicals containing from
1 to 18, preferably 2 to 12, carbon atoms and including radicals such as alkyl,
alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, alkaryl and cycloaliphatic radicals. Particularly preferred as
R and R<sup>1</sup> groups are alkyl groups of 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Thus, the radicals may,
for example, be ethyl, n-propyl, I-propyl, n-butyl, I-butyl, sec-butyl, amyl, n-hexyl, I-hexyl, 
n-octyl, decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, 2-ethylehexyl, phenyl, butylphenyl,
cyclohexyl, methylcyclopentyl, propenyl, butenyl. In order to obtain oil-solubility,
the total number of carbon atoms (i.e. in R and R<sup>1</sup>) in the dithiophoshoric acid will
generally be 5 or greater. The zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphate can therefore
comprise zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates.</p><p num="0038">The composition of the present invention may, optionally, have further added
there-to in a minor amount (F) one or more antioxidants as discussed in further
detail below.</p><heading>(F) <u style="single">Anti-oxidants</u></heading><p num="0039">As stated these may be amines or phenolic. As examples of amines there may be
mentioned secondary aromatic amines such as diarylamines, for example
diphenylamines wherein each phenyl group is alkyl-substituted with an alkyl group
having 4 to 9 carbon atoms. As examples of anti-oxidants there may be
mentioned hindered phenols, including mono-phenols and bis-phenols.</p><p num="0040">Preferably, the anti-oxidant, if present, is provided in the composition in an amount
of up to 3 mass %.</p><p num="0041">Other additives such as pour point depressants, anti-foamants, and/or demulsifiers
may be provided, if necessary.</p><p num="0042">It may be desirable, although not essential, to prepare one or more additive
packages or concentrates comprising the additives, whereby additives (B) to (E),
and (F) if provided, can be added simultaneously to the base oil to form the
lubricating oil composition. Dissolution of the additive package(s) into the
lubricating oil may be facilitated by solvents and by mixing accompanied with mild
heating, but this is not essential. The additive package(s) will typically be
formulated to contain the additive(s) in proper amounts to provide the desired
concentration, and/or to carry out the intended function in the final formulation
when the additive package(s) is/are combined with a predetermined amount of
base lubricant. Thus, additives (B) to (E), and (F) if provided, in accordance with
the present invention, may be admixed with small amounts of base oil or other 
compatible solvents together with other desirable additives to form additive
packages containing active ingredients in an amount, based on the additive
package, of, for example, from 2.5 to 90, preferably from 5 to 75, most preferably
from 8 to 60, mass % of additives in the appropriate proportions, the remainder
being base oil.</p><p num="0043">The final formulations may typically contain about 5 to 40 mass % of the additive
packages(s), the remainder being base oil.</p><p num="0044">The term 'active ingredient' (a.i.) as used herein refers to the additive material that
is not diluent.</p><p num="0045">The terms 'oil-soluble' or 'oil-dispersable' as used herein do not necessarily
indicate that the compounds or additives are soluble, dissolvable, miscible or
capable of being suspended in the oil in all proportions. These do mean, however,
that they are, for instance, soluble or stably dispersible in oil to an extent sufficient
to exert their intended effect in the environment in which the oil is employed.
Moreover, the additional incorporation of other additives may also permit
incorporation of higher levels of a particular additive, if desired.</p><p num="0046">The lubricant compositions of this invention comprise defined individual (i.e.
separate) components that may or may not remain the same chemically before
