to providing ink compositions containing water-soluble dyes that are color-permanent,
particularly, water-fast.</p><p num="0002">A number of ink-jet ink sets utilize water-soluble dyes, which are highly soluble
in water, in order to achieve the right color gamut. Examples of patents that are

patents are assigned to the same assignee as the present application.</p><p num="0003">However, many dye-based inks, after being printed, exhibit poor water-fastness.
There is an increased demand by consumers on the permanence or durability 
of ink-jet print, including water-fastness, light-fastness, smear-fastness, smudge-fastness,
etc. The purpose of the present invention is to improve the durability of water-soluble
dye-based inks, especially the water-fastness, smear-fastness, smudge-fastness,
and light-fastness, lumped together under the term "color permanence", of
such inks.</p><heading><u style="single">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0004">In accordance with the present invention, color permanence in ink-jet inks containing
water-soluble dyes is achieved by using a specific ionic species having a charge
opposite to that on the dye molecule. In most ink-jet inks, the dyes employed are anionic
dyes. Such anionic dyes typically contain one or more sulfonate or carboxylate
anionic groups. Using a specific ionic species of opposite charge, namely, phosphonium
salts, causes the colorant components to "crash" or precipitate out of the water-based
ink onto the print medium due to the formation of a suitable charge complex between
the ionic parts of the dye and the opposite charge of the counter-ion species.</p><p num="0005">The phosphonium salt may be used alone to achieve improved color permanence.
Alternatively, the phosphonium salt may be combined with other phosphonium
salts or other cationic salts, such as quaternary ammonium salts, carbonuim salts, iodonium
salts, sulfonium salts, and pyrillium salts to improve aqueous dispersion stability
and thus printability. Further, other cationic species, such as cationic polymers
and polyfunctional cationic salts may be so combined with the phosphonium salt(s).
Such additional cationic species partially replace the phosphonium salt(s). Alternatively,
certain surfactants, such as aromatic ethoxylates, polyethylene oxide ethers, or
polypropylene oxide ethers may be used to improve print quality.</p><heading><u style="single">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</u></heading><heading><u style="single">(A) Water-fast Phosphonium Salt Additives</u>.</heading><p num="0006">The present invention discloses a novel method of achieving color permanence,
and, more particularly, water-fastness ink components from water-soluble
dyes. In this invention, the water solubility of the dye molecules is particularly enhanced 
by anionic groups such as sulfonates or carboxylates attached to the dye molecule.</p><p num="0007">In accordance with the present invention, a specific phosphonium salt can
form a complex with anionic dye (water soluble) due to the charge exchange between
anionic dye and cationic phosphonium ion. The so-called dye-complex becomes essentially
hydrophobic and render a permanent print which can resist against water
(water-fastness), solvent (smear-fastness), mechanical rubbing with liquid (smudge-fastness)
and, in some case, against the lighting condition where the print is exposed
(light-fastness).</p><p num="0008">On the other hand, due to the increased hydrophobicity, the dye-complex is
occasionally susceptible to precipitation, even in the ink, and causes a problem for
printability. The present invention also provides a solution for good printability with
such kind of dye-complex by a suitable selection and design of chemistry, concentration
of phosphonium salt molecule so that minimized intermolecular collision in the
ink and maximized intermolecular collision in the print can be achieved. The minimized
collision between the cationic salt and anionic dyes is found effective to maximize
the pen performance including stable jettability (no decap, no kogation). In some
cases, the addition of a third component such as surfactants or other cationic salts, including
a second phosphonium and/or non-phosphonium salt, is required to gain this
kind of minimal interaction and stable printability. The maximized collision between
phosphonium salt and anionic dye in the print is achieved when the ink vehicle (water,
solvents, etc.) disappears, such as by penetration into the print media or by evaporation,
and it does provide the highest yield of dye-complex formation, required for
the print permanence, including primarily water-fastness and secondarily other physical
properties such as smear-fastness, smudge-fastness, and light-fastness.</p><p num="0009">The following mechanism likely occurs in the present invention associated
with phosphonium salt and anionic dyes:</p><heading><u style="single">(a) STEP 1: Aqueous Dispersion</u></heading><p num="0010">Dispersion of the dye molecule in water occurs due to its hydrophilicity associated
with anionic functional groups. Dispersion of the phosphonium salt in water
occurs due to its hydrophilicity associated with cationic salt part. However, the hydrophobic
part of the phosphonium salt molecule tends to cause the reduction of this
dispersion. So, water-miscible co-solvents are helpful to gain back the aqueous dispersion. 
The collision between aqueous active dye and salt molecule is essentially
prohibited with the practical concentration of dye and salt in the printable ink.</p><heading><u style="single">(b) STEP 2: Molecular Collision</u></heading><p num="0011">Collision between the anionic dye and the cationic phosphonium salt must occur
due to a shortened collision distance when the water/co-solvent concentration in
the print is reduced, as by penetration into the print media or by evaporation.</p><heading><u style="single">(c) STEP 3: Charge Exchange</u></heading><p num="0012">Complex formation between the anionic dye and the cationic phosphonium
salt must occur in order to gain hydrophobicity. This process must be irreversible to
insure the water-fastness of a dried print. In order to form the dye-salt complex, there
must be a right oxidation potential and reduction potential between two molecules because
one will act as electron donor and the other will act as electron acceptor. The
hydrophobic interaction will lock the complex and prohibit the molecules from going
back to the free form. If the redox potential is not right, the collision will not end up
with a charge exchange and then the complex will not be strongly formed. The complex
force will be destroyed again in a dried print and the water-fastness of the print
will be poor.</p><heading><u style="single">(d) STEP 4: Complex Stabilization</u></heading><p num="0013">The stability or stabilization process occurs by hydrophobic interaction and
charge stabilization, as mentioned above.</p><p num="0014">Here, it is necessary to clarify the electrochemical stability of the complex, required
for permanent print and the stability of the water dispersion of the complex,
and required for good printability. The term "stable complex" described in Step 4
means "electrochemically stable complex", which is formed when the cationic species
is ready to gain back its electron from the anionic species and when the anionic species
is ready to give away its electron to the cationic species in order to form a neutral
species. Such a stable complex is not easily re-ionized by water in the solid state. Another
contributing factor to the stable complex is the strong hydrophobic interaction
between bulky cationic species and bulky anionic species. Charge exchange may occur
between small molecular weight salts such as NaCl, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, etc. However, the
formed new salt KCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, etc. is not the stable complex because K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>,
SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup>, etc. are associated in the aqueous environment only. </p><p num="0015">In the present invention, in many cases, the bulky cations are desired, and the
bulky anions just associate in the ink and the bulky chemistry forms an irreversible
complex when dehydrated. Even though it is believed that the ionic dyes can form a
complex with any opposite charge ionic species, it is rarely to find the dye-complex
exhibiting superior water-fastness in the solid state. For example, the conventional/monofunctional
cationic salts such as ammonium salts, including quaternary ammonium
salts, pyridium salts, piperidinium salts, and the like, do not show any improvement
of water-fastness when added into water soluble anionic dyes. Similarly, other
conventional cationic species including carbonium salts, iodonium salts, sulfonium
salts, pyrrilium salts, etc. also do not show any improvement of water-fastness of water-soluble
anionic dyes. Also again, among the class of phosphonium salts, it has
been discovered that not every phosphonium salt renders good improvement of water-fastness
to the water-soluble anionic dye, but only certain phosphonium salts with
specific chemistry do so. These phosphonium salts are called water-fast phosphonium
salts additives. The phosphonium salts which do not render the water-soluble dyes
into water-fast ink are called non-water-fast phosphonium salt additives.</p><p num="0016">The water-fast phosphonium salts additives of the present invention must have

water-fastness, the dye-complex is occasionally susceptible to precipitation, even in
the pen, and causes a problem for printability. Thus, the dye-complex need to be well-dispersed 
in the aqueous-based vehicle to assure the good and stable jettability. Another
purpose of the present invention is to provide a solution for stable jetting properties
by suppressing the precipitation of the dye-complex in the pen and/or in the
aqueous solution. In the present invention, the inventors discovered suitable surfactants
which can stabilize the complex dispersion and render good printability even
with small drop volume ink jet pens. Generally speaking, the volume of the ink drop
determines the jettability. A smaller drop volume is more difficult to jet. So, if the
dye-complex forms a large particle size, for example, greater than sub-micron, it
would not be jetted out, even from a large drop volume pen of 40 pl. In accordance
with the present invention, one or more surfactants can finely divide the dye-complex
down to the single dye-complex molecule and significantly improves the jettability,
even wit a very small drop volume pen, for example, below 15 pl.</p><p num="0020">Specific surfactants that are useful in improving such jettability include the
non-ionic types that can minimize the precipitation and agglomeration and thus render
significant improvement of printability. Examples of these surfactants include SOLSPERSE
27,000, BRIJ78, BRIJ92, TERGITOL 15-S-5, TERGITOL 15-S-7, TERGITOL
15-S-9, TERGITOL 15-S-12, TERGITOL 15-S-22, TERGITOL 15-S-30, TERGITOL
15-S-40. SOLSPERSE surfactants are aromatic ethoxylates, available from
Zeneca. BRIJ surfactants are polyethylene oxide ethers, available from ICI Surfactants.
TERGITOL surfactants are polyethylene or polypropylene oxide ethers.</p><p num="0021">If employed, the surfactant concentration in the ink ranges from about 0.001 to
50 wt%, preferably from about 0.01 to 10 wt%, and most preferably from about 0.1 to
3 wt%.</p><p num="0022">Usually, each anionic group of the dye molecule contributes to the water solubility
of the dye. There is a need to cap each anionic group by one phosphonium salt
molecule if it is monofunctional. For example, if the dye carries two anionic groups,
then it is necessary to use a molar ratio of dye/monofunctional phosphonium salt = ½.
If the dye has 3 anionic groups, then the molar ratio of dye to monofunctional phosphonium
salt is 1/3. The concentration of surfactant is dependent on the concentration
and the chemistry of the water-fast phosphonium salts utilized in the formulation. The
phosphonium salt having a higher number of carbon atoms will need more surfactant
to be well-dispersed in water. So, it is not a linear relationship between surfactant
concentration and phosphonium salt concentration. That is why there is a wide range 
in the concentration of surfactant relative to the phosphonium salt. Also, it should be
noted that an excess amount of the surfactant in the ink may cause the adverse effect
on water-fastness. Simple experimentation will determine the maximum concentration
of the surfactant for a given phosphonium salt and its concentration. In general, a
longer alkyl chain substituted in the salt requires a higher concentration of surfactant
in order for the dye-salt complex to be well-dispersed.</p><heading><u style="single">(B-2) Non-Water-Fast Phosphonium Salt Additives</u></heading><p num="0023">Besides the suitable surfactants as mentioned above, the inventors also discovered

the water-fastness of the dye-complex However, they can act as a surfactant and increase
