particle containing a metal oxide, a method of producing a
polymer composite particle and a cosmetic comprising the
polymer composite particle.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0002">Ultraviolet absorbers are formulated in cosmetics for
the purpose of protecting bare skin from ultraviolet rays.
These ultraviolet absorbers may be roughly classified into
organic types and inorganic types. Examples of the former
include cinnamic acid derivatives, benzophenone derivatives,
methylaminobenzoic acid derivatives and salicylic acid
derivatives. Examples of the latter include metal oxides
such as zinc oxide, titanium oxide, cerium oxide and iron
oxide. In the case of organic ultraviolet absorbers, there
is the problem that these absorbers have a low absorption
wavelength region, are constituted of unstable compounds and
penetrate into the skin so that the effect of these absorbers
does not last long. In the case of inorganic ultraviolet
absorbers, there is the problem that these absorbers have
less dispersibility in a product formulation and not much
good feeling in use.</p><p num="0003">Capsulation of metal oxides is known as one proposal
for making compatible dispersibility in a product 
formulation and a good feeling in use. For example, in JP-A
9-208437, a cosmetic is disclosed which is prepared by
coating a metal oxide having an average particle diameter
of 0 . 003 to 0.1 µm with a resin powder, in an emulsion cosmetic.
However, because an ionic dispersant is used to disperse the
metal oxide in this method, the hydrophilic portions of the
metal oxide aggregate in the W/O emulsion cosmetic in the
case where the metal oxide partly exists on the surface of
the resin powder, and therefore the stability of the
formulation is impaired and protection from ultraviolet
rays is ineffective.</p><p num="0004">Also, in another attempt, studies have been made
concerning cosmetics combining protection from ultraviolet
rays and a good feeling in use by using a combination of
several powders. For example, in JP-A 9-235217, cosmetics
containing inorganic powders are disclosed in which silica
having a particle diameter of 0.01 to 10 µm is coated with
zinc oxide, and in which a super-microparticle titanium
oxide having a particle diameter of 0 . 001 to 0.10 µm is coated
with a plate talc, mica and/or sericite.</p><p num="0005">However, when the resin powder in which these metal
oxides are coated is used alone or in combination with a
super-microparticle titanium oxide, a cosmetic having an
effective UVA protection and a good feeling in use cannot
be obtained.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0006">The present invention relates to a polymer composite 
particle having a metal oxide coated with a silicone and/or
fluorine compound, the metal oxide having an average
particle diameter of 1 µm or less. The polymer composite
particle is obtained by polymerizing a vinyl monomer with
a crosslinking agent, wherein the vinyl monomer is contained
in an amount of 25% or more weight based on 100% weight of
the sum of the whole monomer and crosslinking agent. The
vinyl monomer has a solubility parameter (calculated by the
Fedors method) of less than about 8.9. The vinyl monomer
has a solubility parameter, preferably, of less than 8.9.</p><p num="0007">The present invention also relates to a polymer
composite particle comprising a metal oxide coated with a
silicone and/or fluorine compound, the metal oxide having
an average particle diameter of 1 µm or less, wherein a
cosmetic comprising the polymer composite particle in an
amount corresponding to 5% by weight of the metal oxide and
1% by weight of 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate has an SPF
of 7 or more.</p><p num="0008">The present invention also relates to a method of
producing the polymer composite particle, a cosmetic
comprising the cosmetic polymer composite particle, and a
cosmetic use of the polymer composite particle.</p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p num="0009">While the specification concludes with claims

by reference.</p><p num="0011">The term "W/O" as used herein means water-in-oil.</p><p num="0012">The present invention relates to a polymer composite
particle having superb blending stability even in a W/O
emulsion cosmetic, highly effective ultraviolet protection
and a good feeling in use; the present invention also relates
to a method of producing the polymer composite particle and 
a cosmetic composition comprising the polymer composite
particle.</p><p num="0013">The present invention also relates to a highly
effective ultraviolet protection cosmetic, particularly
highly effective in protection from ultraviolet rays having
long wavelengths, having visible-light transmittance (as
defined below)) and a good feeling in use.</p><p num="0014">The inventors of the present invention have found that
the use of a combination of three type of powders including
a microparticle metal oxide having the effect of protecting
from ultraviolet rays ranging widely from UVB to UVAII and
visible light transmittance, a zinc oxide having a flake
particle shape and being highly effective in scattering
light ranging from UVAII to UVAI close to visible light, and
a polymer composite particle containing a coated
microparticle metal oxide makes it possible to improve
ultraviolet protection efficiently and to obtain an
ultraviolet protection cosmetic having visible-light
transmittance when applied and a good feeling in use.</p><heading>[Polymer composite particle]</heading><p num="0015">The polymer composite particle of the present
invention has an average particle diameter of preferably
from 0.1 to 20 µm and more preferably from 1 to 20 µm from
the viewpoint of highly effective ultraviolet protection and
an excellent feeling in use. When the particle diameter is
too small, a frictional feeling is caused and therefore the
particle diameter is preferably 0.1 µm or more. The shape 
of the particle is preferably spherical in view of an
excellent feeling in use though no particular limitation is
imposed on it.</p><p num="0016">The average particle diameter of the polymer composite
particle is a volume average particle diameter measured
using a laser (light) diffraction/scattering method (LA-910,
manufactured by Horiba, Ltd.) or an electric resistance
method (Coulter counter).</p><p num="0017">The content of the metal oxide in the polymer composite
particle of the present invention is preferably from 25 to
90% by weight and more preferably from 30 to 70% by mass based
on the whole polymer composite particle. In this range, the
polymer composite particle has a highly effective
ultraviolet protectionability.</p><p num="0018">The polymer composite particle of the present
invention preferably has an SPF of 7 or more, in which SPF
is measured using the same method as in the case of measuring
SPF in the formulation of Test Example 1 which will be
explained later.</p><p num="0019">Namely, the polymer composite particle of the present
invention is a polymer composite particle comprising a metal
oxide coated with a silicone and/or fluorine compound,
wherein the metal oxide has an average particle diameter of
1 µm or less. The cosmetic comprising the polymer composite
particle in an amount corresponding to 5% by weight of the
metal oxide and 1% by weight of 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate
has an SPF of 7 or more. </p><p num="0020">In order for a cosmetic comprising the polymer
composite particle in an amount corresponding to 5% by weight
of the metal oxide and 1% by weight of 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate
to have an SPF of 7 or more in the measuring
method which will be explained later, the metal oxide must
be sufficiently dispersed in the cosmetic. Therefore, the
SPF is a dispersion index showing that the metal oxide is
properly dispersed in the polymer composite particle.</p><heading>[Metal oxide]</heading><p num="0021">Examples of the metal oxide include silicon dioxide,
iron oxide, zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide,
titanium oxide and cerium oxide. One or more types selected
from the group consisting of zinc oxide, titanium oxide
and/or cerium oxide, including mixtures, are preferable.</p><p num="0022">As the metal oxide, a metal oxide coated with a silicone
and/or fluorine compound is used. Making the metal oxide
hydrophobic by coating with a silicone and/or fluorine
compound improves dispersibility in a monomer. Also, even
if the metal oxide is present on the surface of the polymer
composite particle, aggregation among polymers is prevented
and also highly effective ultraviolet protection is obtained
since the surface of the metal oxide is made hydrophobic.</p><p num="0023">The surface treatment of the metal oxide is preferably
carried out to coat the metal oxide with a silicone and/or
fluorine compound with a treating agent. Examples of the
treating agent include methyl hydrogen polysiloxane,
dimethylpolysiloxane, reactive alkylpolysiloxanes having a 
hydroxy group, halogen atom, amino hydrogen group or alkoxy
group (these functional groups may be present at one terminal,
both terminals or the side chain or may be connected to the
silicon atom either directly or through a divalent
hydrocarbon group which may have a substituent) as described
in the publication of JP-A No. 5-339518 and the publication
of JP-A No. 7-196946 and fluorine-containing hydrogen
polysiloxanes as described in the publication of JP-A No.
6-23262. These agents may be reacted with the metal oxide
by heating or the like. Also, commercially available metal
oxides coated with a silicone and/or fluorine compound may
be used.</p><p num="0024">The amount of the silicone and/or fluorine compound
to be applied is preferably 0.1 to 20% by weight and more
preferably 1 to 10% by weight based on 100% by weight of the
metal oxide.</p><p num="0025">The average particle diameter of the metal oxide is
preferably 1 µm or less, more preferably 0.01 to 1 µm and
even more preferably 0.1 to 1 µm from the viewpoint of
improving the effectiveness of ultraviolet protection and
the visible-light transmittance of the polymer composite
particle.</p><p num="0026">The average particle diameter of the metal oxide is
a volume average particle diameter measured by a dynamic
light scattering method (ELS-8000 manufactured by Otsuka
Electronics Co., Ltd.)</p><heading>[Monomer]</heading><p num="0027">As the vinyl monomer to be used as a raw material of
the polymer composite particle of the present invention, a
monomer having a solubility parameter preferably less than
about 8.9, more preferably about 8.8 or less, is used from
the viewpoint of increased dispersibility and reduced
uniformity of the metal oxide in the particle. The lower
limit of the solubility parameter is preferably 6.0 or more
and more preferably 7.0 or more in view of the availability
of the monomer. The solubility parameter is a value obtained
by rounding numbers off to the first decimal place. When
the solubility parameter is high, the metal oxide is
uniformly dispersed in the monomer. However, in the polymer
composite particle after being polymerized, the metal oxide
are gathered in the vicinity of the surface layer, bringing
about a decrease in the effectiveness of protection from
ultraviolet rays.</p><p num="0028">The solubility parameter used in this specification
is a value δ (cal/cm<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> (hereinafter also referred to an
SP value) calculated from the following equation (I)
according to the Fedors method [R.F. Fedors. Polyme. Eng.

parameter less than about 8.9 include alkyl (meth)acrylates 
having a straight-chain or branched alkyl group which may
be fluorinated and has 8 or more carbon atoms (preferably
8 to 40 carbon atoms) and more preferably alkyl
(meth)acrylates having a straight-chain or branched alkyl

ability and a good feeling in use.</p><p num="0076">The preferred cosmetic of the present invention uses
