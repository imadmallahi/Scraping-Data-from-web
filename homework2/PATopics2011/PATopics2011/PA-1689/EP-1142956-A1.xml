polycarbonate resin composition. Precisely, the invention
relates to a flame-retardant polycarbonate resin composition
and its moldings, which do not contain halogen but contain minor
additives to exhibit good flame retardancy, and which have good
impact resistance, good stability to molding heat, good wet heat
resistance and good recyclability, and are resistant to static
electrification.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND ART</u></heading><p num="0002">As having the advantages of impact resistance, heat
resistance, good electric properties and dimensional stability,
polycarbonate resins have many applications in various fields
of, for example, OA (office automation) appliances, information
and communication appliances, other electric and electronic
appliances for industrial use and household use, automobile
parts and building materials. As a rule, polycarbonate resins
are self-extinguishable. However, in some fields of typically
OA appliances, information and communication appliances, and
other electric and electronic appliances, it is desirable that 
the level of the flame retardancy of the products is increased
for ensuring further safety of the products.</p><p num="0003">For improving the flame retardancy of polycarbonate
resins, halogen-containing flame retardants such as bisphenol
A halides and halogenated polycarbonate oligomers have been
used along with a flame retardation promoter such as antimony
oxide, as their flame-retarding ability is good. However, with
the recent tendency toward safety living and environmental
protection from discarded and incinerated wastes, the market
requires flame retardation with non-halogen flame retardants.
Polycarbonate resin composition containing, as a non-halogen
flame retardant, any of phosphorus-containing organic flame
retardants, especially organic phosphate compounds have good
flame retardancy. In addition, organic phosphate compounds
serve as a plasticizer, and various types of compositions
containing them have been proposed.</p><p num="0004">In order to make polycarbonate resins have good flame
retardancy by adding thereto a phosphate compound, a relatively
large amount of the compound must be added to the resins. In
general, polycarbonate resins require relatively high molding
temperatures, and their melt viscosity is high. Therefore, for
molding them into thin-walled and large-sized moldings, the
molding temperature will have to be further higher. For these
reasons, phosphate compounds often cause some problems when
added to such polycarbonate resins, though their flame-retarding 
ability is good. For example, phosphate compounds
often adhere to molds used for molding resins containing them,
and generate gas to have some unfavorable influences on the
working environments and even on the appearance of the moldings.
Another problem with phosphate compounds is that, when the
moldings containing them are left under heat or in high-temperature
and high-humidity conditions, the compounds lower
the impact strength of the moldings and yellow the moldings.
On the other hand, the recent tendency in the art is toward
recycling resin products for saving natural resources.
However, as not stable under heat, phosphate compounds are
against the requirement for recycling resin products containing
them. This is still another problem with phosphate compounds.</p><p num="0005">Apart from the above, known is another technique of adding
silicone compounds to polycarbonate resins to make the resins
have flame retardancy. In this, silicone compounds do not give
toxic gas when fired. For example, (1) Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 139964/1998 discloses a flame retardant that
comprises a silicone resin having a specific structure and a
specific molecular weight.</p><p num="0006">(2) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 45160/1976,
318069/1989, 306265/1994, 12868/1996, 295796/1996, and
Japanese Patent Publication No. 48947/1991 disclose
silicone-containing flame-retardant polycarbonate resins.
The level of the flame retardant disclosed in (1) is high in 
some degree. The technology of (2) differs from that of (1)
in that the silicones used in (2) do not act as a flame retardant
by themselves, but are for improving the drip resistance of
resins, and some examples of silicones for that purpose are
mentioned. Anyhow, in (2), the resins indispensably require
an additional flame retardant of, for example, phosphate
compounds or salts of Group 2 metals.</p><p num="0007">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 176425/1996 discloses a
method of using an organic alkali metal or alkaline earth metal
salt and a polyorganosiloxane for improving the flame
retardancy of polycarbonate resins without detracting from the
transparency thereof. In this, however, the flame retardancy
of the resin compositions could be improved, but the impact
resistance thereof is often lowered.</p><p num="0008">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 172063/1999 discloses a
flame-retardant thermoplastic resin material for molding,
which comprises (A) from 1 to 99 parts by weight of an aromatic
vinyl resin having an acid base such as an alkali metal sulfonate,
and (B) from 1 to 99 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin
except (A); and a flame-retardant thermoplastic resin material
for molding, which comprises 100 parts by weight of the resin
mixture of (A) and (B), and from 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of
a flame retardant (C) added thereto. Concretely, it discloses
&lt;1&gt; a molding material comprising 90 parts by weight of (A) and
10 parts by weight of (B) GPPS [polystyrene]; and &lt;2&gt; a molding 
material comprising 10 parts by weight of (A), 80 parts by weight
of (B) PPE [polyphenylene ether] and 10 parts by weight of (C)
TPP [triphenyl phosphate].</p><p num="0009">The laid-open patent publication shows the case &lt;1&gt; in
which the content of the aromatic vinyl resin having an acid
base such as an alkali metal sulfonate is 90 % by weight and
is extremely large, and the case &lt;2&gt; in which the content of
the resin is 10 % by weight and is small and the resin is combined
with the additional flame retardant. In other words, when the
content of the component (A) is small therein, the molding
material is not resistant to flames . Accordingly, as is obvious
from Comparative Example 1 therein, the component (A) alone
cannot be molded into shaped articles . The serious problem with
the technique disclosed is that a large amount of an aromatic
vinyl resin having an acid base such as an alkali metal sulfonate
must be used therein. Accordingly, the moldings obtained
therein could be self-extinguishable and resistant to flames,
but their physical properties intrinsic to thermoplastic resin
would be significantly worsened.</p><p num="0010">In the current situation as above, the object of the
present invention is to provide a flame-retardant polycarbonate
resin composition containing a non-halogen flame retardant
enough to ensure good flame retardancy and capable of being
formed into good moldings which have good impact resistance,
good thermal stability and good wet heat resistance intrinsic 
to polycarbonate resin, and which are recyclable and are
resistant to static electrification; and to provide such
moldings of the composition.</p><heading><u style="single">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0011">To attain the object of the invention, we, the present
inventors have assiduously studied to find out additives that
may serve as a flame retardant for polycarbonate resins, not
detracting from the impact resistance, the heat resistance and
the recyclability of the resin moldings containing them. As
a result, we have found that, when a small amount of an acid
base-containing aromatic vinyl resin is combined with a drip
inhibitor and when the resulting combination is added to
polycarbonate resin, then the resulting polycarbonate resin
composition has good flame retardancy and its moldings have good
impact resistance, good heat resistance and good wet heat
resistance and are resistant to static electrification. In
addition, we have further found that even when the moldings are
recycled in a mode of re-melting them and re-molding the
resulting melt, the thus-recycled moldings can still have good
physical properties and are yellowed little. On the basis of
these findings, we have completed the invention.</p><p num="0012">Specifically, the invention provides the following:

composition of the invention is not specifically defined, and
may be any and every one known in the art. Generally used herein
are aromatic polycarbonates to be produced from diphenols and
carbonate precursors. For example, herein used are
polycarbonates as produced by reacting a diphenol and a
carbonate precursor in a solution method or in a melt method,
such as those produced through reaction of a diphenol and
phosgene or through interesterification of a diphenol and a
diphenyl carbonate.</p><p num="0015">Various diphenols are usable, typically including
2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane [bisphenol A], bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane,
1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)propane,
4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl,
bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cycloalkanes, bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)
oxide, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfide, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)
sulfone, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfoxide,
bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) ether, and bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) ketone.</p><p num="0016">As the diphenols for use herein, preferred are
bis(hydroxyphenyl)alkanes, especially those consisting
essentially of bisphenol A. The carbonate precursors for use
in the invention include, for example, carbonyl halides,
carbonyl esters, and haloformates, concretely, phosgene,
diphenol dihaloformates, diphenyl carbonate, dimethyl
carbonate, and diethyl carbonate. Other diphenols such as 
hydroquinone, resorcinol, and catechol are also usable in the
invention. The diphenols mentioned herein may be used either
singly or as combined.</p><p num="0017">The polycarbonate resin may have a branched structure,
for which the branching agent includes, for example, 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane,
α,α',α"-tris(4-hyroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene,
phloroglucine, trimellitic acid,
and isatin-bis(o-cresol). For controlling the molecular
weight of the polycarbonate resin, for example, employable are
phenol, p-t-butylphenol, p-t-octylphenol, and p-cumylphenol.</p><p num="0018">The polycarbonate resin for use in the invention may be
a copolymer having a polycarbonate moiety and a
polyorganosiloxane moiety, or may also be a polycarbonate resin
containing a copolymer of the type. Further, it may also be
a polyester-polycarbonate resin to be produced through
polymerization of a polycarbonate in the presence of an ester
precursor, such as a difunctional carboxylic acid (e.g.,
terephthalic acid) or its ester-forming derivative. Various
types of different polycarbonate resins may be mixed to give
mixed polycarbonate resins for use in the invention.
Preferably, the polycarbonate resin for the component (A) in
the invention does not substantially contain halogen in its
structure. In view of its mechanical strength and moldability,
the polycarbonate resin preferably has a viscosity-average
molecular weight of from 10, 000 to 100, 000, more preferably from 
11,000 to 40,000, even more preferably from 12,000 to 30,000.</p><heading>(B) Acid base-containing Aromatic Vinyl Resin:</heading><p num="0019">The acid base-containing aromatic vinyl resin for use in
the invention is a thermoplastic aromatic vinyl resin in which
the aromatic ring is substituted with an acid base. The
aromatic vinyl resin is a thermoplastic resin having at least
a styrenic structure, which includes, for example, polystyrenes,
rubber-modified polystyrenes, styrene-acrylonitrile
copolymers, and ABS resins. Of those, preferred are
polystyrene resins.</p><p num="0020">The acid base to be bonded to the aromatic ring in the
aromatic vinyl resin is not specifically defined, including,
for example, bases of sulfonic acid, bases of boric acid and
bases of phosphoric acid. Concretely, they are alkali metal
salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of the
acids. The ratio of substitution with any of such acid bases
in the aromatic vinyl resin is not specifically defined, and
the resin may contain both a substituted aromatic ring and a
non-substituted aromatic ring.</p><p num="0021">Preferred examples of the acid base-containing aromatic
vinyl compound are mentioned below. The following formula (1)
represents acid base-containing polystyrene resins. <img id="img-00110001" orientation="unknown" wi="116" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00110001.tif" inline="no" he="60"/>
wherein X represents an acid base; m falls between 1 and 5; Y
represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon residue having from
1 to 10 carbon atoms; and n indicates a molar fraction, falling
within a range of 0 &lt; n ≤ 1.</p><p num="0022">The acid base of X is any of bases of sulfonic acid, bases
of boric acid and bases of phosphoric acid, including, for
example, alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and
ammonium salts of the acids. The metal includes, for example,
sodium, aluminium, potassium, lithium, rubidium, cesium,
beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc and tin.</p><p num="0023">Y is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon residue having from
1 to 10 carbon atoms, and is preferably a hydrogen atom or a
methyl group. m falls between 1 and 5; and 0 &lt; n ≤ 1. Concretely,
the acid base, X, may be bonded to all the bonds extending from
the aromatic ring, or may be partially bonded to some bonds from
it. As the case may be, a part of the aromatic rings in the
polystyrene resin may have no acid base bonded thereto. For
obtaining the flame retardancy intended in the invention, the 
ratio of substitution with the acid base in the aromatic ring
shall be determined in consideration of the content of the acid
base-containing aromatic vinyl resin in the resin composition,
and is not specifically defined. In general, the ratio of acid
base substitution in the aromatic vinyl resin for use in the
invention falls between 10 and 100 %.</p><p num="0024">The acid base-containing aromatic vinyl resin for the
component (B) is not limited to the polystyrene resins of
formula (1), but may be a copolymer of a styrenic monomer and
any other comonomer copolymerizable with the monomer, as so
mentioned hereinabove. For producing the acid base-containing
aromatic vinyl resin, for example, employable is &lt;1&gt; a method
of polymerizing or copolymerizing an aromatic vinyl monomer
having a sulfonic acid group such as that mentioned above,
optionally along with a comonomer capable of copolymerizing
with the monomer; or &lt;2&gt; a method of sulfonating an aromatic
vinyl polymer, or a copolymer of an aromatic vinyl monomer with
any other copolymerizable comonomer, or a mixture of such
polymers, followed by neutralizing it with a basic substance.</p><p num="0025">One example of the method &lt;2&gt; is described. A mixture
of concentrated sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride is added to
a 1,2-dichloroethane solution of a polystyrene resin, and
reacted under heat for a few hours to produce a sulfonated
polystyrene. Next, this is neutralized with an equimolar
amount, relative to the sulfonic acid group in the polymer, of 
potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide to obtain potassium or
sodium polystyrene-sulfonate.</p><p num="0026">The weight-average molecular weight of the acid base-containing
aromatic vinyl resin (B) for use in the invention
may fall between 1,000 and 300,000 or so, preferably between
2, 000 and 200, 000 or so. The weight-average molecular weight
of the resin may be measured through gel permeation
chromatography (GPC).</p><heading>(C) Drip Inhibitor:</heading><p num="0027">The drip inhibitor for use in the invention is not
specifically defined, so far as it has the ability to prevent
the polycarbonate resin from melting and dripping from the resin
moldings. For example, preferred for the drip inhibitor are
fluorine resins, especially fluoro-olefin resins. Fluoro-olefin
resins for use herein may be ordinary resins or copolymer
resins having a fluoroethylene structure. For example, they
include difluoroethylene resins, tetrafluoroethylene resins,
tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer resins,
and copolymer resins of tetrafluoroethylene and an ethylenic
monomer not containing fluorine. Preferred are
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resins preferably having a mean
molecular weight of at least 500,000, more preferably from
500,000 to 10,000,000.</p><p num="0028">Of such polytetrafluoroethylene resins, more preferred
are those having the ability to form fibrils, as they ensure 
higher drip inhibition. The fibril-forming
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resins are not specifically
defined, but preferred is PTFE of Type 3 stipulated in the ASTM
Standard. Specific examples of PTFE of Type 3 include Teflon
6-J (from Mitsui-DuPont Fluorochemical), Polyflon D-1,
Polyflon F-103, Polyflon F201L (all from Daikin Industry), and
CD-076 (from Asahi Glass Fluoropolymers).</p><p num="0029">Others except PTFE of Type 3 are also employable herein,
including, for example, Argoflon F5 (from Montefluos),
Polyflon MPA and Polyflon FA-100 (both from Daikin Industry).
These polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resins may be used either
singly or as combined. The fibril-forming
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resins as above may be obtained,
for example, by polymerizing tetrafluoroethylene in an aqueous
solvent in the presence of sodium, potassium or ammonium
peroxydisulfide, under a pressure of 1 MPa, at a temperature
falling between 0 and 200°C, preferably between 20 and 100°C.</p><p num="0030">In addition to the fluoro-olefin resins, per-se known
compounds are also usable for the drip inhibitor. For example,
silicone resins such as polyorganosiloxanes are usable, and
they include polydimethylsiloxane resins,
polymethylphenylsiloxane resins, polydiphenylsiloxane resins,
polymethylethylsiloxane resins, and their copolymer resins.
In addition, also preferred for the drip inhibitor are modified
silicone resins of which the terminals or the side chains of 
the molecular structure are substituted with any organic group
of hydroxyl, amino, epoxy, carboxyl and mercapto groups.</p><p num="0031">The number-average molecular weight of the silicone
resins may be at least 200, but preferably falls between 500
and 5,000,000. The morphology of the silicone resins is not
specifically defined, and may be in any form of oils, varnishes,
gums, powders and pellets.</p><p num="0032">Still other examples of the drip inhibitor are phenolic
resins, which may be obtained by reacting a phenol compound,
such as phenol, cresol, xylenol or alkylphenol, with an aldehyde
such as formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde or acetaldehyde, in the
presence of a catalyst. The phenolic resins for use herein may
be any of resol-type phenolic resins or novolak-type phenolic
resins.</p><p num="0033">The content of each component in the flame-retardant
polycarbonate resin composition of the invention is described.
The resin composition comprises (A) from 90 to 99.98 % by weight,
preferably from 97 to 99.96 % by weight of a polycarbonate resin,
(B) from 0.01 to 5 % by weight, preferably from 0.02 to 2 % by
weight, more preferably from 0.03 to 1 % by weight of an acid
base-containing aromatic vinyl resin, and (C) from 0.01 to 5 %
by weight, preferably from 0.02 to 2 % by weight of a drip
inhibitor. In this, the expression of % by weight is based on
the total weight of the components (A), (B), (C). In this, the
content of the acid base-containing aromatic vinyl resin (B) 
may be determined, depending on the level of the desired flame
retardancy of the resin composition and in consideration of the
ratio of substitution with the acid base group on the aromatic
ring in (B) specifically described hereinabove.</p><p num="0034">If the content of the acid base-containing aromatic vinyl
resin (B) in the resin composition is smaller than 0.01 % by
weight, the flame retardancy and the resistance to static
electrification of the resin composition will be poor; but if
larger than 5 % by weight, the appearance of the resin moldings
will be poor, and, in addition, the thermal stability of the
resin composition dwelling in molding lines will be poor.
Therefore, for obtaining comprehensively excellent moldings,
the content of the component (B) therein is preferably small,
for example, falling between 0.03 and 1 % by weight.</p><p num="0035">If the content of the drip inhibitor (C) in the resin
composition is smaller than 0.02 % by weight, the drip-inhibiting
ability of the composition will be not enough for
the intended flame retardancy of the composition. However,
even if the content is larger than 5 % by weight, the effect
of the drip inhibitor added could not be augmented any more,
and such a large amount of the drip inhibitor, if added to the
composition, will have some negative influences on the impact
resistance and the outward appearance of the moldings of the
composition. Therefore, the amount of the drip inhibitor to
be added to the composition may be suitably determined, 
depending on the necessary flame retardancy of the moldings of
the composition, for example, based on V-0, V-1 or V-2 in UL-94,
and depending on the content of the component (B) and also on.
the amount of the other constituent components.</p><p num="0036">In case where the moldings of the flame-retardant
polycarbonate resin composition of the invention are desired
to have higher flame retardancy, various types of flame
retardants may be added to the composition. The flame retardant
is not specifically defined, and may be any conventional ones.
For example, any of organic phosphorus compounds, non-halogen
phosphorus compounds, silicone compounds, halogen compounds,
nitrogen compounds, metal hydroxides, red phosphorus, antimony
oxides, or expanding graphite may be added to the composition,
depending on the object of the composition.</p><p num="0037">The halogen compounds include, for example,
tetrabromobisphenol A, halogenopolycarbonates,
halogenopolycarbonate copolymers or oligomers,
decabromodiphenyl ether, (tetrabromobisphenol) epoxy
oligomers, halogenopolystyrenes, and halogenopolyolefins.
The nitrogen compounds include, for example, melamine, and
alkyl group or aromatic group-substituted melamines; the metal
hydroxides include, for example, magnesium hydroxide, and
aluminium hydroxide.</p><p num="0038">Halogen-containing flame retardants are relatively
effective, but are unfavorable, as often discharging harmful 
gases when resin compositions containing them are molded into
moldings, or often corroding the molds used, or often
discharging harmful substances when the moldings are
incinerated. Therefore, preferred are non-halogen flame
retardants, as they are safe and do not pollute the environment.</p><p num="0039">If desired, the polycarbonate resin composition of the
invention may contain any other thermoplastic resins,
elastomers and inorganic fillers that are effective for
improving the moldability of the composition and for improving
the impact resistance, the toughness, the chemical resistance
and the flame retardancy of the moldings of the composition.</p><p num="0040">The other thermoplastic resins that may be added to the
resin composition of the invention are those compatible with
or dispersible in polycarbonate resin. For example, they
include polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate and
polybutylene terephthalate; polystyrene resins including
rubber-modified polystyrene resins and syndiotactic
structure-having polystyrene resins; polyphenylene-ether
resins; polyphenylene-sulfide resins; polymethacrylate
resins; and polyolefin resins such as polyethylene,
polypropylene, polybutene and their copolymers.</p><p num="0041">The polystyrene resins may be added to the flame-retardant
polycarbonate resin composition of the invention for
improving the melt flowability of the resin composition, or that
is, for improving the moldability thereof. The polystyrene 
resins may be polymers that are prepared through polymerization
of a monomer or monomer mixture of from 20 to 100 % by weight
of a monovinylic aromatic monomer such as styrene or α-methylstyrene,
from 0 to 60 % by weight of a vinyl cyanide-type
monomer such as acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile, and
from 0 to 50 % by weight of any other vinylic monomer
copolymerizable with those monomers, such as maleimide, methyl
acrylate or methyl methacrylate. The polymers include, for
example, polystyrenes (GPPS), acrylonitrile-styrene
copolymers (AS resins).</p><p num="0042">As the styrenic resins, also preferably used herein are
rubber-modified styrenic resins. The rubber-modified
styrenic resins are preferably high-impact styrenic resins that
are produced through grafting polymerization of rubber with at
least styrenic monomers. The rubber-modified styrenic resins
include, for example, high-impact polystyrenes (HIPS) produced
through polymerization of rubber such as polybutadiene with
styrene; ABS resins produced through polymerization of
polybutadiene with acrylonitrile and styrene; MBS resins
produced through polymerization of polybutadiene with methyl
methacrylate and styrene. These rubber-modified styrenic
resins may be combined, or may be mixed with other styrenic
resins not modified with rubber such as those mentioned above,
and the resin mixtures may be used in the invention.</p><p num="0043">In the rubber-modified styrenic resins, the amount of 
rubber to modify them may fall, for example, between 2 and 50 %
by weight, but preferably between 5 and 30 % by weight, more
preferably between 5 and 15 % by weight. If the rubber content
is smaller than 2 % by weight, the impact resistance of the resin
moldings will be poor. If, on the other hand, it is larger than
50 % by weight, the thermal stability of the resin composition
will be lowered, and the melt flowability thereof will be also
lowered. If so, the resin composition will be unfavorably
gelled or yellowed. Specific examples of rubber for use herein
include polybutadiene, acrylate and/or methacrylate-having
rubber-like polymers, styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) rubber,
styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), butadiene-acrylic rubber,
isoprene rubber, isoprene-styrene rubber, isoprene-acrylic
rubber, and ethylene-propylene rubber. Of those, especially
preferred is polybutadiene. The polybutadiene usable herein
may be any of low-cis polybutadiene (for example, having from
1 to 30 mol% of 1,2-vinyl bonds and from 30 to 42 mol% of 1,4-cis
bonds) or high-cis polybutadiene (for example, having at most
20 mol% of 1,2-vinyl bonds and at least 78 mol% of 1, 4-cis bonds),
and even their mixtures.</p><p num="0044">Elastomers that may be added to the resin composition of
the invention may be various types of elastomers including those
used in rubber-modified polystyrene resins. Above all,
preferred are grafted elastomers, which have a two-layered
structure composed of a core and a shell and in which the core 
is of a flexible rubber material and the shell that covers the
core is of a hard resin material. As a whole, the elastomers
themselves are powdery or granular. After blended with a
polycarbonate resin in melt, the core/shell-type, grafted
elastomer mostly keeps its original powdery or granular
condition. Since the grafted elastomer keeps its original
powdery or granular condition after having been blended with
the resin melt, it can uniformly disperse in the resin
composition and is effective for preventing the moldings of the
resin composition from being troubled by surface layer peeling.</p><p num="0045">Known are various core/shell-type, grafted elastomers
that are usable herein. Commercially-available products of
such elastomers include, for example, Hiblen B621 (from Nippon
Zeon), KM-330 (form Rohm &amp; Haas), Metablen W529, Metablen S2001,
Metablen C223, Metablen B621 (all from Mitsubishi Rayon).</p><p num="0046">Among others, preferred are those to be produced through
polymerization of one or more vinylic monomers in the presence
of a rubber-like polymer that is obtained from monomers of
essentially alkyl acrylates or alkyl methacrylates and
dimethylsiloxane. In the alkyl acrylates and acryl
methacrylates, the alkyl group preferably has from 2 to 10
carbon atoms. Concretely, the alkyl acrylates and
methacrylates include, for example, ethyl acrylate, butyl
acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, and n-octyl methacrylate.
One example of the rubber-like elastomers obtained from 
monomers of essentially those alkyl acrylates is a polymer to
be prepared through reaction of at least 70 % by weight of the
alkyl acrylates with at most 30 % by weight of other
copolymerizable vinylic monomers such as methyl methacrylate,
acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and styrene. To prepare the
polymer, a polyfunctional monomer serving as a crosslinking
agent, such as divinylbenzene, ethylene dimethacrylate,
triallyl cyanurate, or triallyl isocyanurate, may be added to
the polymerization system.</p><p num="0047">The vinylic monomers to be polymerized in the presence
of a rubber-like polymer include, for example, aromatic vinyl
compounds such as styrene, α-methylstyrene; acrylates such as
methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate; and methacrylates such as
methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate. One or more these
monomers may be (co)polymerized, as combined, or may be
copolymerized with any other vinylic monomers such as vinyl
cyanide compounds (e.g., acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile),
and vinyl esters (e.g., vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate) . The
(co)polymerization may be effected in any known method of, for
example, bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization, or
emulsion polymerization. Preferred is emulsion
polymerization.</p><p num="0048">It is desirable that the core/shell-type, grafted
elastomers thus produced in the manner mentioned above contain
at least 20 % by weight of the rubber-like polymer moiety. 
Typical examples of the core/shell-type, grafted elastomers are
MAS resin elastomers such as graft copolymers of styrene and
methyl methacrylate with from 60 to 80 % by weight of n-butyl
acrylate. Especially preferred are composite rubber grafted
copolymers to be prepared through graft copolymerization of a
composite rubber with at least one vinylic monomer, in which
the composite rubber comprises from 5 to 95 % by weight of a
polysiloxane rubber component and from 5 to 95 % by weight of
a polyacryl (meth) acrylate rubber component as so entangled that
they are not separated from each other, and has a mean particle
size of from 0.01 to 1 µm or so. The composite rubber grafted
copolymers are better than single rubber grafted copolymers,
as their effect of improving the impact resistance of resin
moldings is higher than that of the latter, single rubber
grafted copolymers. Commercial products of such composite
rubber grafted copolymers are available, for example,
Metablen S-2001 from Mitsubishi Rayon.</p><p num="0049">Inorganic fillers that may be in the resin composition
of the invention are, for example, talc, mica, kaolin,
diatomaceous earth, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium
sulfate, glass fibers, carbon fibers, and potassium titanate
fibers. Especially preferred for use herein are tabular
fillers of, for example, talc and mica, and fibrous fillers.
Talc is a magnesium silicate hydrate, and this is available on
the market. The inorganic filler such as talc for use herein 
may have a mean particle size of from 0.1 to 50 µm, but preferably
from 0.2 to 20 µm. The inorganic filler, especially talc in
the resin composition is effective for further enhancing the
toughness of the moldings of the composition, and, as the case
may be, it will be able to reduce the amount of the flame
retardant to be in the composition.</p><p num="0050">The inorganic filler content of the resin composition may
fall between 1 and 100 parts by weight, preferably between 2
and 50 parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of the
constituent components (A), (B), (C) . If its amount is smaller
than 1 part by weight, the inorganic filler added could not
satisfactorily exhibit its effect of enhancing the toughness
and the flame retardancy of the moldings of the composition;
but if larger than 100 parts by weight, the impact resistance
of the moldings will lower and the melt flowability of the
composition will lower. The amount of the inorganic filler to
be in the composition may be suitably determined, depending on
the necessary properties of the moldings and the moldability
of the composition, especially on the thickness of the moldings
and the spiral flow length of the composition.</p><p num="0051">The flame-retardant polycarbonate resin composition of
the invention may contain, in addition to the indispensable
components (A), (B) and (C), any additives which are generally
added to ordinary thermoplastic resins, if desired. The
additives are for further improving the moldability of the 
composition and for further improving the impact resistance,
the outward appearances, the weather resistance and the
toughness of the moldings of the composition. They include,
for example, phenolic, phosphorus-containing or sulfur-containing
antioxidants, antistatic agents, polyamide-polyether
block copolymers (for permanent static
electrification resistance), benzotriazole-type or
benzophenone-type UV absorbents, hindered amine-type light
stabilizers (weather-proofing agents), plasticizers,
microbicides, compatibilizers, and colorants (dyes, pigments).
For their amount, the optional additives that may be in the
flame-retardant polycarbonate resin composition of the
invention are not specifically defined, provided that they do
not interfere with the properties of the composition.</p><p num="0052">Methods for producing the flame-retardant polycarbonate
resin composition of the invention are described. The resin
composition may be produced by mixing and kneading the
components (A) to (C) in a predetermined ratio as above,
optionally along with the optional components and additives as
above in any desired ratio. Formulating and mixing the
constituent component into the intended resin composition may
be effected in any known manner, for example, by pre-mixing them
in an ordinary device, such as a ribbon blender or a drum tumbler,
followed by further kneading the resulting pre-mix in a Banbury
mixer, a single-screw extruder, a double-screw extruder, a 
multi-screw extruder, or a cokneader. The temperature at which
the components are mixed and kneaded generally falls between
240 and 300°C. For molding the melt mixture, preferably used
is an extrusion molding machine, more preferably a vented
extruder. Other constituent components than polycarbonate
resin may be previously mixed with polycarbonate resin or with
any other thermoplastic resin to prepare a master batch.</p><p num="0053">Having been prepared in the manner as above, the
flame-retardant polycarbonate resin composition of the
invention may be molded into various moldings in the melt-molding
devices as above, or, after it is pelletized, the
resulting pellets may be molded into various moldings through
injection molding, injection compression molding, extrusion
molding, blow molding, pressing, vacuum forming or foaming.
Especially preferably, the composition is pelletized in the
melt-kneading manner as above, and the resulting pellets are
molded into moldings through injection molding or injection
compression molding. For injection molding of the composition,
employable is a gas-assisted molding method which is effective
for preventing sinking and for reducing the weight of the
moldings.</p><p num="0054">Moldings of the flame-retardant polycarbonate resin
composition of the invention, especially injection moldings
thereof are usable for various housings and parts for electric
and electronic appliances, such as duplicators, facsimiles, 
televisions, radios, tape recorders, video decks, personal
computers, printers, telephones, information terminals,
refrigerators, and microwave ovens. The moldings have still
other applications, and are usable, for example, as automobile
parts.</p><p num="0055">The invention is described more concretely with reference
to the following Examples and Comparative Examples, which,
however, are not intended to restrict the scope of the
invention.</p><heading>Examples 1 to 5, and Comparative Examples 1 to 5:</heading><p num="0056">The components shown in Table 1 were blended in the ratio
