comprising a mixture of cementitious material, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and
sufficient water to form a slurry.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention relates to a cementing composition for sealing a subterranean
zone penetrated by a well bore.</p><p num="0002">In the drilling and completion of an oil or gas well, a cementing composition is often
introduced in the well bore for cementing pipe string or casing. In this process, known as
"primary cementing," the cementing composition is pumped into the annular space between
the walls of the well bore and the casing. The cementing composition sets in the annular
space, supporting and positioning the casing, and forming a substantially impermeable barrier,
or cement sheath, which isolates the well bore into subterranean zones. Thus, the undesirable
migration of fluids between zones is prevented after primary cementing.</p><p num="0003">Changes in pressure or temperature in the well bore over the life of the well can result
in compromised zonal isolation. Also, activities undertaken in the well bore, such as pressure
testing, well completion operations, hydraulic fracturing, and hydrocarbon production can
affect zonal isolation. Such compromised zonal isolation is often evident as cracking or
plastic deformation in the cementing composition, or de-bonding between the cementing
composition and either the well bore or the casing.</p><p num="0004">As the name implies, cementing compositions are made chiefly of cement. Due to its
incompressible nature, neat cement is undesirable for use where there is a chance of
expansion or contraction in the well bore. Cement has a high Young's modulus, and fractures
at slight strains when subjected to stresses ("brittle failure"). When the imposed stresses
exceed the stress at which the cement fails, the cement sheath can no longer provide zonal
isolation. While the Young's modulus of cementing compositions can be lowered by adding
silica compositions, such silica treated cementing compositions ("water-extended slurries")
suffer from lower compressive and tensile strengths.</p><p num="0005">We have now devised a cementing composition that can provide greater elasticity and
compressibility, while retaining high compressive and tensile strengths, for primary
cementing.</p><p num="0006">A cementing composition for sealing a subterranean zone penetrated by a well bore
according to the present embodiment comprises a mixture of cementitious material 
("cement"), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer, and sufficient water to form a
slurry.</p><p num="0007">In another embodiment, ABS is added to water-extended slurries to create a cementing
composition with a lower Young's modulus while achieving high compressive and tensile
strengths.</p><p num="0008">A variety of cements can be used with the present embodiments, including cements
comprised of calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, and/or sulfur which set and harden by
reaction with water. Such hydraulic cements include Portland cements, pozzolan cements,
gypsum cements, aluminous cements, silica cements, and alkaline cements. Portland cements
of the type defined and described in API Specification 10, 5<sup>th</sup> Edition, July 1, 1990, of the
American Petroleum Institute (the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated as if
reproduced in its entirety) are preferred. API Portland cements include Classes A, B, C, G,
and H, of which API Classes A, G, and H are particularly preferred for the present
embodiment. The desired amount of cement is understandably dependent on the cementing
operation.</p><p num="0009">ABS used with the present embodiments is often produced as a composite material. In
the production of such a composite material, a preformed elastomer such as polybutadiene or
styrene butadiene rubber is used as a substrate, and styrene and acrylonitrile monomers are
grafted onto the substrate by polymerization. In addition, styrene and acrylonitrile that fail to
graft to the substrate copolymerize to form a matrix, with the grafted substrate dispersed in the
matrix. Higher levels of butadiene in the final product increases the elastomeric properties of
the composite material. In contrast, higher levels of styrene and acrylonitrile in the final
product decrease the elastomeric properties of the composite material. As can be appreciated,
the character of the ABS varies by the composition of the composite material, and thus affects
the mechanical properties of the cementing composition.</p><p num="0010">ABS is normally sold in a fine particulate or pellet form. ABS with particle sizes
ranging from 5-500 microns is preferable. More preferably, the particle size is in the 50-300
micron range, and most preferably in the 100-250 micron range. Such ABS is widely
available commercially. Some examples of commercially available ABS includes BLENDEX
338™ ABS made with a 70% polybutadiene substrate (the remaining 30% being a mixture of 
styrene and acrylonitrile), 180 micron particle size ("Type I"), BLENDEX 336™ ABS made
with a 65% styrene-butadiene rubber substrate, 180 micron particle size ("Type II"),
BLENDEX 415™ ABS made with a 65% styrene-butadiene rubber substrate, 250 micron
particle size ("Type III"), and BLENDEX 102S™ ABS with a 35% styrene-butadiene rubber
substrate, less than 1 mm particle size ("Type IV"), all available from GE Specialty Chemicals,
Parkersburg, West Va., U.S.A. ABS is present in an amount that is 5-30% by weight of the
cement in a particular cementing composition.</p><p num="0011">Water in the cementing composition is present in an amount sufficient to make a slurry
which is pumpable for introduction down hole. The water used to form a slurry in the present
embodiment can be fresh water, unsaturated salt solution, including brines and seawater, and
saturated salt solution. Generally, any type of water can be used, provided that it does not
contain an excess of compounds, well known to those skilled in the art, that adversely affect
properties of the cementing composition. The water is present in an amount of about 38-70%
by weight of the cement, and more preferably in an amount of about 60% by weight of the
cement.</p><p num="0012">A variety of additives may be added to the cementing composition to alter its physical
properties. Such additives may include slurry density modifying materials (e.g., silica flour,
silica fume, sodium silicate, microfine sand, iron oxides and manganese oxides), dispersing
agents, set retarding agents, set accelerating agents, fluid loss control agents, strength
retrogression control agents, and viscosifying agents well known to those skilled in the art.</p><p num="0013">The following example is illustrative of the methods and compositions discussed
above.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 1</b></heading><p num="0014">Class G cement, silica flour, and the components in the amounts listed in <b>TABLE 1</b>
were added to form seven batches. The batches were prepared according to API Specification
RP 10B, 22<sup>nd</sup> Edition, 1997, of the American Petroleum Institute (the entire disclosure of
which is hereby incorporated as if reproduced in its entirety). For example, Batch 6 was
prepared by combining 500 grams of Class G cement, 175 grams of silica flour, 50 grams of
Type IV ABS (Particle size, &lt;1 mm), and 317 grams of tap water in a Waring blender to
obtain a slurry with density of 14.8 pounds per gallon. All batches had the same density. </p><p num="0015">ABS Types I-IV are described above. ABS Type V has a high butadiene content and a
density of 1.040 g/cc, with a particle size less than 500 microns, and is available from Sigma-Aldrich
Co., St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.</p><p num="0016">To test each batch for various strength parameters, a portion of each batch was placed
into a corresponding 2"x2" brass mold, and another portion of each batch was placed into a
corresponding cylindrical plastic container provided with a lid. The seven molds and seven
cylinders were cured in a 180°F water bath for 24 hours to form samples of the batches.</p><p num="0017">Using the above-described samples, the strength parameters were measured by a
strength testing instrument manufactured by Tinius Olsen, Willow Grove, Penn., U.S.A.,
according to the American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM C109 procedure (the
entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated as if reproduced in its entirety). The tensile
strengths were measured on the same instrument according to the ASTM C 190-97 procedure
(the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated as if reproduced in its entirety). The
burst strengths were measured on an MTS load frame instrument manufactured by MTS
Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, Minn., U.S.A. The Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio,
Brazilian tensile strength, and permeability were also determined for each batch, and are listed

strength, even though the Young's modulus value was low. This can result in failure of the
cement sheath to provide effective zonal isolation. In contrast, the ABS batches, Batches 2-7,
had much higher compressive strengths, and favorable tensile strengths (where measured).
<b>TABLE 1</b> also shows that selection of the ABS type affects the mechanical properties of the
cementing composition, thus allowing the cementing composition to be tailored to suit
conditions in a particular well bore.</p><p num="0019">It is speculated that the acrylonitrile in ABS hydrolyzes in the cement slurries and
generates carboxylates which facilitate bonding of the normally incompatible elastomer to the
cement. Such bonding may allow dissipation of imposed stresses, thus preventing brittle
failure of the cement sheath.</p><p num="0020">Using the raw stress-strain data used in the determination of the compressive strength,
Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratios listed in <b>TABLE 1</b>, the areas under the curves

axial stress-strain and radial stress-strain graphs were determined, and the values are listed in
