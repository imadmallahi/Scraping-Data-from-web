thereof as intermediates for preparing lubricating oil and fuel additives and as
performance improving additives for lubricating oils and fuels.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0002">The viscosity of lubricating oils, particularly the viscosity of mineral oil
based lubricating oils, is generally dependent upon temperature. As the temperature
of the oil is increased, the viscosity usually decreases.</p><p num="0003">The function of a viscosity improver is to reduce the extent of the decrease in
viscosity as the temperature is raised or to reduce the extent of the increase in
viscosity as the temperature is lowered, or both. Thus, a viscosity improver
ameliorates the change of viscosity of an oil containing it with changes in
temperature. The fluidity characteristics of the oil are improved.</p><p num="0004">Numerous types of additives are used to improve lubricating oil and fuel
compositions. Such additives include, but are certainly not limited to dispersants
and detergents of the ashless and ash-containing variety, oxidation inhibitors, anti-wear
additives, friction modifiers, and the like. Such materials are well known in
the art and are described in many publications, for example, Smalheer, et al.,
"Lubricant Additives", Lezius-Hiles Co., Cleveland, OH , USA (1967); M.W.
Ranney, Ed., "Lubricant Additives", Noyes Data Corp., Park Ridge, NJ, USA
(1973); M.J. Satriana, Ed., "Synthetic Oils and Lubricant Additives, Advances since
1977", Noyes Data Corp., Park Ridge, NJ, USA (1982), W.C. Gergel, "Lubricant
Additive Chemistry", Publication 694-320-65R1 of The Lubrizol Corp., Wickliffe, 
OH, USA (1994); and W.C. Gergel et al., "Lubrication Theory and Practice",
Publication 794-320-59R3 of The Lubrizol Corp., Wickliffe, OH, USA (1994); and
in numerous United States patents, for example, Chamberlin, III, U.S. 4,326,972,
Schroeck et al., U.S. 4,904,401, Blystone et al., U.S. 5,356,546 and Ripple et al.,
U.S. 4,981,602. Many such additives are frequently derived from carboxylic
reactants, for example, acids, esters, anhydrides, lactones, and others. Specific
examples of commonly used carboxylic compounds used as intermediates for
preparing lubricating oil additives include alkyl- and alkenyl substituted succinic
acids and anhydrides, polyolefin substituted carboxylic acids, aromatic acids, such
as salicylic acids, and others. Illustrative carboxylic compounds are described in
Meinhardt et al., U.S. 4,234,435; Norman et al., U.S. 3,172,872; LeSuer et al., U.S.
3,454,607, and Rense, U.S. 3,215,707.</p><p num="0005">Dispersants are well-known in the lubricating art. Dispersants are employed
in lubricants to keep impurities, particularly those formed during operation of
mechanical devices such as internal combustion engines, automatic transmissions,
etc. in suspension rather than allowing them to deposit as sludge or other deposits on
the surfaces of lubricated parts.</p><p num="0006">Conventional dispersants are poor contributors to improving high
temperature, e.g., 100°C, viscosity. Mixtures of conventional dispersants with
polymeric viscosity improvers are often used but such combinations are costly and
may adversely affect low temperature viscometric performance.</p><p num="0007">Dispersant-viscosity improvers which provide both dispersancy and viscosity
improving characteristics to an oil are well known.</p><p num="0008">It has now been found that mixtures of carboxylic compositions and
derivatives thereof, as set forth in greater detail hereinbelow provide improved
100°C viscosity to lubricants without adversely affecting low temperature propertics.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0009">The present invention relates to a carboxylic composition comprising
hydrocarbon substituted carboxylic acylating agents prepared by reacting, optionally 
in the presence of an acidic catalyst, a polyolefin and a terpolymer, simultaneously
or individually in any order, with at least one carboxylic reactant selected from the
group consisting of compounds of the formula
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>3</sup>C(O)(R<sup>4</sup>)<sub>n</sub>C(O)OR<sup>5</sup></st32:che>
wherein each of R<sup>3</sup> and R<sup>5</sup> is independently H or a hydrocarbyl group, R<sup>4</sup> is a
divalent hydrocarbylene group, and n is 0 or 1, and reactive sources thereof.</p><p num="0010">In another embodiment, the invention relates to derivatives of the foregoing
carboxylic composition, with one or more of (1) an amine characterized by the
presence within its structure of at least one HN&lt; group; (2) an alcohol; (3) a reactive
metal or a reactive metal compound; and (4) a mixture of two or more of (1) through
(3); the components of (4) being reacted with the mixture of carboxylic acylating
agents simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.</p><p num="0011">Additive concentrates containing these compositions and lubricating oil and
fuel compositions are also contemplated.</p><heading><u style="single">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u></heading><p num="0012">Various preferred features and embodiments of the invention are described
below by way of non-limiting illustration.</p><p num="0013">As used herein, the terms "hydrocarbon", "hydrocarbyl" or "hydrocarbon
based" mean that the group being described has predominantly hydrocarbon
character within the context of this invention. These include groups that are purely
hydrocarbon in nature, that is, they contain only carbon and hydrogen. They may
also include groups containing substituents or atoms which do not alter the
predominantly hydrocarbon character of the group. Such substituents may include
halo-, alkoxy-, nitro-, etc. These groups also may contain hetero atoms. Suitable
hetero atoms will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for example,
sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen. Therefore, while remaining predominantly hydrocarbon
in character within the context of this invention, these groups may contain atoms
other than carbon present in a chain or ring otherwise composed of carbon atoms.</p><p num="0014">In general, no more than about three non-hydrocarbon substituents or hetero
atoms, and preferably no more than one, will be present for every 10 carbon atoms in 
the hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon based groups. Most preferably, the groups are
purely hydrocarbon in nature, that is they are essentially free of atoms other than
carbon and hydrogen.</p><p num="0015">Throughout the specification and claims the expression oil soluble or
dispersible is used. By oil soluble or dispersible is meant that an amount needed to
provide the desired level of activity or performance can be incorporated by being
dissolved, dispersed or suspended in an oil of lubricating viscosity. Usually, this
means that at least about 0.001% by weight of the material can be incorporated in a
lubricating oil composition. For a further discussion of the terms oil soluble and
dispersible, particularly "stably dispersible", see U.S. Patent 4,320,019 which is
expressly incorporated herein by reference for relevant teachings in this regard.</p><p num="0016">It must be noted that as used in this specification and appended claims, the
singular forms also include the plural unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
Thus the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include the plural; for example "a
monomer" includes mixtures of monomers of the same type. As another example the
singular form "monomer" is intended to include both singular and plural unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.</p><p num="0017">In the context of this invention the term "copolymer" means a polymer
derived from two or more different monomers. Thus, a polymer derived from a
mixture of, for example, ethylene and propylene, is a copolymer as defined herein.</p><heading><u style="single">The Carboxylic Compositions</u></heading><p num="0018">The carboxylic compositions of this invention comprise the hydrocarbon
substituted carboxylic acylating agents prepared by reacting, optionally in the
presence of an acidic catalyst, a polyolefin and a terpolymer, simultaneously or
individually in any order, with at least one carboxylic reactant selected from the
group consisting of compounds of the formula
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sup>3</sup>C(O)(R<sup>4</sup>)<sub>n</sub>C(O)OR<sup>5</sup></st32:che>
wherein each of R<sup>3</sup> and R<sup>5</sup> is independently H or a hydrocarbyl group, R<sup>4</sup> is a
divalent hydrocarbylene group, and n is 0 or 1, and reactive sources thereof. </p><heading><u style="single">The Polyolefin</u></heading><p num="0019">The polyolefin, from which the carboxylic composition is derived, is
typically derived from olefins containing from 2 to about 28 carbon atoms, and
mixtures thereof, more often from homopolymerized and interpolymerized olefins
having from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms,. Typically. the olefins are alpha olefins.
The polyolefins usually have number average molecular weights (<o ostyle="single">M</o><sub>n</sub>) ranging from
about 300 to about 20,000, often up to about 10,000, preferably from about 300 to
about 5000, often from about 700 to about 5,000, frequently to about 2500.</p><p num="0020">In one preferred embodiment, the polyolefin is derived from polybutene, that
is, a polymer of C<sub>4</sub> olefins, including 1-butene, 2-butene and isobutylene. Those
derived from isobutylene, i.e., polyisobutylenes, are especially preferred. In another
preferred embodiment, the polyolefin is a polypropylene. In another preferred
embodiment, the polyolefin is an ethylene-alpha olefin polymer, particularly
ethylene-propylene polymers. Molecular weights of such polymers may vary over a
wide range, but especially preferred are those having number average molecular
weights (<o ostyle="single">M</o><sub>n</sub>) ranging from about 300 to about 20,000, preferably from about 300
to about 10,000, often from about 700 to about 5000, particularly up to about 2500.</p><p num="0021">A preferred source of polybutenes is that obtained by polymerization of a C<sub>4</sub>
refinery stream having a butene content of 35 to 75 weight percent and isobutylene
content of 15 to 60 weight percent in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as
aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride. These polybutenes contain predominantly
(greater than 80% of total repeating units) isobutylene repeating units of the
configuration
<img id="img-00050001" orientation="unknown" wi="29" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00050001.tif" inline="no" he="24"/>
These polybutenes are typically monoolefinic, that is they contain but one olefinic
bond per molecule.</p><p num="0022">The olefinic compound may be a polyolefin comprising a mixture of isomers
wherein from about 50 percent to about 65 percent are tri-substituted olefins wherein 
one substituent contains from 2 to about 500 carbon atoms, often from about 30 to
about 200 carbon atoms, more often from about 50 to about 100 carbon atoms,
usually aliphatic carbon atoms, and the other two substituents are lower alkyl.</p><p num="0023">When the olefin is a tri-substituted olefin, it frequently comprises a mixture
of cis- and trans- 1-lower alkyl-1-aliphatic hydrocarbyl containing from 30 to
about 100 carbon atoms)- 2-lower alkyl ethene and 1,1-di-lower alkyl- 2-(aliphatic
hydrocarbyl containing from 30 to about 100 carbon atoms) ethene.</p><p num="0024">In one embodiment, the monoolefinic groups are predominantly vinylidene
groups, e.g., groups of the formula
<img id="img-00060001" orientation="unknown" wi="23" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060001.tif" inline="no" he="10"/>
especially those of the formula
<img id="img-00060002" orientation="unknown" wi="38" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060002.tif" inline="no" he="16"/>
although the polybutenes may also comprise other olefinic configurations.</p><p num="0025">In one embodiment the polybutene is substantially monoolefinic,
comprising at least about 30 mole %, preferably at least about 50 mole % vinylidene
groups, more often at least about 70 mole % vinylidene groups. Such materials and
methods for preparing them are described in U.S. Patents 5,286,823 and 5,408,018,
which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. They are commercially
available, for example under the tradenames ULTRAVIS® (BP Chemicals) and
GLISSOPAL® (BASF).</p><heading><u style="single">The Terpolymer</u></heading><p num="0026">The terpolymer is a copolymer generally derived from at least two olefins,
usually alpha olefins, and a non-conjugated polyene, preferably a diene or triene,
usually a diene. The terpolymers are generally lower molecular weight terpolymers
such as those having <o ostyle="single">M</o><sub>n</sub> ranging from about 1000 to about 15,000, more often from
about 2500 to about 10,000, and frequently from about 5000 to about 9000. </p><p num="0027">One of the olefins is usually ethylene and the other is an olefin having from 3
to about 28 carbon atoms, often 3 to about 8 carbon atoms, more often 3 or 4 carbon
atoms. Most often one olefin is ethylene and the other is propylene.</p><p num="0028">The third component utilized in preparing the terpolymer may be at least one
non-conjugated polyene, usually a diene. Examples include aliphatic dienes such as
1,4- and 1,5- hexadienes, branched dienes such as 3- and 4- methyl 1,4- hexadienes,
bicyclic dienes such as exo- and endo-dicyclopentadiene, exo- and endo- alkenyl
norbornenes, alkyl alkenyl norbornenes, alkylidene norbornenes such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene,
alkyl norbornadienes such as methyl norbornadiene,
cyclodienes, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the diene is a dicyclopentadiene or
alkylidene norbornene.</p><p num="0029">The ethylene content of ethylene-alpha olefin-non-conjugated polyene
terpolymers generally ranges from about 25% to about 85% by weight, preferably
from about 30% to about 75% and more preferably from about 40% to about 70% by
weight. The polyene content typically is below about 25%, preferably between
about 2% to about 20% and more often from about 0.5% or about 1% to about 15%
by weight.</p><p num="0030">The terpolymers may be prepared by methods well known to those of skill in
the art and are commercially available, for example those marketed by Uniroyal
Chemical Co., Inc., Middlebury, Conn., USA, under the tradename TRILENE®.
Specific examples include Trilene 67 and 68, terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and
ethylidene norbornene (ENB), and Trilene 55 and 65, terpolymers of ethylene,
propylene and dicyclopentadiene. Some typical characteristics of Trilene 67 and 68

piperidines, piperazine, aminoalkyl substituted piperazines, for example,
aminoethylpiperazine, morpholine, aminoalkyl substituted morpholines, pyrrolidine,
and aminoalkyl-substituted pyrrolidines, are especially preferred. Usually the
aminoalkyl substituents are substituted on a nitrogen atom forming part of the hetero
ring. Specific examples of such heterocyclic amines include N-aminopropylmorpholine,
N-aminoethylpiperazine, and N,N'-diaminoethyl-piperazine.
Hydroxy alkyl substituted heterocyclic polyamines are also useful. Examples
include N-hydroxyethylpiperazine and the like.</p><p num="0085">In another embodiment, the amine is a polyalkene-substituted amine. These
polyalkene-substituted amines are well known to those skilled in the art. They are
disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,275,554; 3,438,757; 3,454,555; 3,565,804; 3,755,433;
and 3,822,289. These patents are hereby incorporated by reference for their
disclosure of polyalkene-substituted amines and methods of making the same.</p><p num="0086">Typically, polyalkene-substituted amines are prepared by reacting
halogenated-, preferably chlorinated-, olefins and olefin polymers (polyalkenes)
with amines (mono- or polyamines). The amines may be any of the amines
described above. Examples of these compounds include poly(propylene)amine;
N,N-dimethyl-N-poly (ethylene/propylene)amine, (50:50 mole ratio of monomers);
polybutene amine; N,N-di(hydroxyethyl)-N-polybutene amine; N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-N-polybutene
amine; N-polybutene-aniline; N-polybutenemorpholine;
N-poly(butene) ethylenediamine; N-poly(propylene)trimethylenediamine;
N-poly(butene)diethylene-triamine; N',N'-poly(butene)tetraethylenepentamine;
N,N-dimethyl-N'-poly(propylene)-1,3-propylenediamine and the
like.</p><p num="0087">The polyalkene substituted amine is characterized as containing from at least
about 8 carbon atoms, preferably at least about 30, more preferably at least about 35
up to about 300 carbon atoms, preferably 200, more preferably 100. In one 
embodiment, the polyalkene substituted amine is characterized by an n (number,
average molecular weight) value of at least about 500. Generally, the polyalkene
substituted amine is characterized by an n value of about 500 to about 5000,
preferably about 800 to about 2500. In another embodiment n varies between about
500 to about 1200 or 1300.</p><p num="0088">As noted hereinabove, ammonia and hydrazines having at least one N-H
group are also useful. Preferably there are at least two hydrogens bonded directly to
hydrazine nitrogen and, more preferably, both hydrogens are on the same nitrogen.
Substituents which may be present on the hydrazine include alkyl, alkenyl, aryl,
aralkyl, alkaryl, and the like. Usually, the substituents are alkyl, especially lower
alkyl, phenyl, and substituted phenyl such as lower alkoxy-substituted phenyl or
lower alkyl-substituted phenyl. Specific examples of substituted hydrazines are
methylhydrazine, N,N-dimethyl-hydrazine, N,N'-dimethylhydrazine,
phenylhydrazine, N-phenyl-N'-ethylhydrazine, N-phenyl-N'-cyclohexylhydrazine,
and the like.</p><p num="0089">The carboxylic derivative compositions produced by reacting the carboxylic
acylating agents of the invention and the amines described above are acylated
amines which may include, for example, amine salts, amides, imides and
imidazolines as well as mixtures thereof. To prepare the carboxylic derivative
compositions from the amines, one or more of the carboxylic acylating agents and
one or more amines are heated, optionally in the presence of a normally liquid,
substantially inert organic liquid solvent/diluent, at temperatures in the range of from
about 80°C up to the decomposition point, i.e., the temperature at which any of the
reactants or the product begins to decompose. Normally, temperatures in the range
of from about 100°C up to about 300°C are used, provided 300°C does not exceed
the decomposition point. Temperatures of about 125°C to about 250°C are normally
used.</p><p num="0090">The carboxylic acylating agent and the amine are reacted in an amount
sufficient to provide from about one-half equivalent up to two moles of amine per
equivalent of the carboxylic acylating agent. In another embodiment, the carboxylic 
acylating agent is reacted with from about one-half equivalent up to one mole of,
amine per equivalent of the carboxylic acylating agent.</p><p num="0091">For the purpose of this invention, an equivalent of amine is that amount of
amine corresponding to the total weight of amine divided by the total number of
nitrogens present. Thus, octyl amine has an equivalent weight equal to its molecular
weight; ethylenediamine has an equivalent weight equal to one-half its molecular
weight, and aminoethylpiperazine has an equivalent weight equal to one-third of its
molecular weight.</p><p num="0092">The number of equivalents of acylating agent depends on the number of
carboxylic functions present in the acylating agent. Conventional techniques are
available for determining the number of carboxylic functions (e.g.. acid number,
saponification number, etc.) and thus, the number of equivalents of acylating agent
available to react with amine.</p><p num="0093">U.S. Patents 3,172,892; 3,219,666; 3,272,746, and 4,234,435 are expressly

applicable to reacting the carboxylic acylating agents of this invention with the
amines as described above. In applying the disclosures of these patents to the
carboxylic acylating agents of the present invention, the latter can be substituted for
the high molecular weight carboxylic acid acylating agents disclosed in these patents
on an equivalent basis.</p><heading><u style="single">(2) The Alcohol Reactant</u></heading><p num="0094">Alcohols useful for preparing carboxylic derivative compositions of this
invention from the carboxylic acylating agents previously described include those
compounds of the general formula
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sub>3</sub>-(OH)<sub>m</sub></st32:che>
wherein R<sub>3</sub> is a monovalent or polyvalent organic radical joined to the -OH groups
through carbon-to-oxygen bonds (that is,
<img id="img-00230001" orientation="unknown" wi="23" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00230001.tif" inline="no" he="17"/> 
wherein the carbon is not part of a carbonyl group) and m is an integer of from 1 to
about 10, usually 2 to about 6. As with the amine reactant, the alcohols can be
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic, including aliphatic-substituted
cycloaliphatic alcohols, aliphatic-substituted aromatic alcohols, aliphatic-substituted
heterocyclic alcohols, cycloaliphatic-substituted aliphatic alcohols, cycloaliphatic-substituted
aromatic alcohols, cycloaliphatic-substituted heterocyclic alcohols,
heterocyclic-substituted aliphatic alcohols, heterocyclic-substituted cycloaliphatic
alcohols, and heterocyclic-substituted aromatic alcohols. Except for the
polyoxyalkylene alcohols, the mono- and polyhydric alcohols corresponding to the
above formula will usually contain not more than about 40 carbon atoms and
generally not more than about 20 carbon atoms. The alcohols may contain non-hydrocarbon
substituents of the same type mentioned with respect to the amines
above, that is, non-hydrocarbon substituents which do not interfere with the reaction
of the alcohols with the acylating agents of this invention. In general, polyhydric
alcohols are preferred.</p><p num="0095">The monohydric and polyhydric alcohols include monohydroxy and
polyhydroxy aromatic compounds. Monohydric and polyhydric phenols and
naphthols are preferred hydroxyaromatic compounds. Usually, the hydroxy
aromatic compound will contain 1 to 4 hydroxy groups. Aromatic hydroxy
compounds are illustrated by the following specific examples: phenol, betanaphthol,
cresols, resorcinol, catechol, p,p'-dihydroxybiphenyl, 2,4-dibutylphenol,
propenetetramer-substituted phenol, 4,4'-methylene-bis-phenol, polyisobutenyl(molecular
weight of about 1000)-substituted phenol, the condensation product of
heptylphenol with 0.5 mole of formaldehyde, the condensation product of
octylphenol with acetone, di(hydroxyphenyl)oxide, di(hydroxyphenyl)sulfide and 4-cyclohexylphenol.
Phenol itself and aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenols, e.g.,
alkylated phenols having up to 3 aliphatic hydrocarbon substituents are especially
preferred.</p><p num="0096">Monohydric aliphatic and cycloaliphatic alcohols include methanol, ethanol,
isooctanol, cyclohexanol, behenyl alcohol, neopentyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, 
monobutyl ether of ethylene glycol, monooleate of ethylene glycol, tert-butyl,
alcohol, and dioleate of glycerol. Alcohols may be unsaturated such as allyl alcohol,
cinnamyl alcohol, 1-cyclohexene-3-ol and oleyl alcohol.</p><p num="0097">Other specific alcohols are the ether alcohols and amino alcohols including,
for example, the oxyalkylene, oxy-arylene-, amino-alkylene-, and aminoarylene-substituted
alcohols having one or more oxyalkylene, aminoalkylene or aminoaryleneoxy-arylene,
groups. They are exemplified by Cellosolve, carbitol,
phenoxyethanol, aminoethanol, p-aminophenol, and the like.</p><p num="0098">The polyhydric alcohols preferably contain from 2 to about 10 hydroxy
groups. They are illustrated, for example, by the alkylene glycols and
polyoxyalkylene glycols, glycerol, monooleate of glycerol, pentaerythritol,
erythritol, sorbitol, and xylene glycol. Carbohydrates such as sugars, starches and so
forth likewise can be used.</p><p num="0099">Polyhydric alcohols having at least 3 hydroxyl groups, some, but not all of
which have been esterified with an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having from about
8 to about 30 carbon atoms are useful.</p><p num="0100">A preferred class of alcohols is that containing up to about 12 carbon atoms,
and especially those containing 3 to 10 carbon atoms. This class of alcohols
includes glycerol, erythritol, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, gluconic acid,
glyceraldehyde, glucose, arabinose, 1,7-heptanediol, 2,4-heptanediol, 1,2,3-hexanetriol,
1,2,4-hexanetriol, 1,2,5-hexanetriol, 2,3,4-hexanetriol, 1,2,3-butanetriol,
1,2,4-butanetriol, guinic acid, 2,2,6,6-tetrakis-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanol, 1,10-decanediol,
and the like. Aliphatic alcohols containing at least three hydroxyl
groups and up to 10 carbon atoms are particularly preferred, especially polyhydric
alkanols containing 3 to 10 carbon atoms and particularly, 3 to 6 carbon atoms and
having at least three hydroxyl groups. Such alcohols are exemplified by glycerol,
erythritol, pentaerythritol, mannitol, sorbitol, 2-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol(trimethylolethane),
2-hydroxymethyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol(trimethylpropane),
1,2,4-hexanetriol, and the like. </p><p num="0101">From what has been stated above, it is seen that the amine reactant may
contain alcoholic hydroxy substituents and the alcohol reactant can contain primary,
secondary, or tertiary amino substituents. Thus. amino alcohols can fall into both
classes provided they contain at least one primary or secondary amino group. If only
tertiary amino groups are present, the amino alcohol belongs only to the class of
alcohols.</p><p num="0102">The alcohols may be polyoxyalkylene alcohols and derivatives thereof such
as hydrocarbyl ethers thereof. Such polyoxyalkylene alcohols may be prepared by
reacting, for example, a hydroxy-substituted compound, R<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>q</sub> wherein q is 1 to 6,
preferably 2 to 3, and R<sub>4</sub> is a residue of a mono- or polyhydric alcohol or mono- or
polyhydroxy phenol, naphthol, etc., reacted with an alkylene oxide such as
<img id="img-00260001" orientation="unknown" wi="34" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00260001.tif" inline="no" he="15"/>
to form a hydrophobic base, R<sub>5</sub> being a lower alkyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms,
R<sub>6</sub> being hydrogen or the same as R<sub>5</sub> with the proviso that the alkylene oxide does
not contain in excess of 10 carbon atoms. This base is then reacted with ethylene
oxide to provide a hydrophilic portion resulting in a molecule having both
hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions. Compounds illustrative of R<sub>4</sub>-(OH)<sub>q</sub> include
aliphatic polyols such as alkylene glycols and alkane polyols such as ethylene
glycol, propylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, etc.,
and aromatic hydroxy compounds such as alkylated mono- and polyhydric phenols
and naphthols such as cresol, heptylphenols, dodecylphenols, resorcinols, etc. The
polyoxyalkylene alcohols and other alcohols useful in the process of the present
invention are described in more detail in U.S. Patent 4,234,435 (Meinhardt et al) in
Cols. 29-32 and that disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p num="0103">The carboxylic derivative compositions produced by reacting the carboxylic
acylating agents of this invention with alcohols are esters. Both acidic esters and
neutral esters are contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Acidic
esters are those in which some of the carboxylic acid functions in the acylating
agents are not esterified but are present as free carboxyl groups. Obviously, acid 
esters are easily prepared by using an amount of alcohol insufficient to esterify all of
the carboxyl groups in the carboxylic acylating agents of this invention.</p><p num="0104">The acylating agents of this invention are reacted with the alcohols according
to conventional esterification techniques. This normally involves heating the
acylating agent of this invention with the alcohol, optionally in the presence of a
normally liquid, substantially inert, organic liquid solvent/diluent and/or in the
presence of esterification catalyst. Temperatures of at least about 100°C up to the
decomposition point are used (the decomposition point having been defined
hereinbefore). This temperature is usually within the range of about 100°C up to
about 300°C with temperatures of about 140°C to 250°C often being employed.
Usually, at least about one-half equivalent of alcohol is used for each equivalent of
acylating agent. An equivalent of acylating agent is the same as discussed above
with respect to reaction with amines. An equivalent of alcohol is its molecular
weight divided by the total number of hydroxyl groups present in the molecule.
Thus, an equivalent weight of ethanol is its molecular weight while the equivalent
weight of ethylene glycol is one-half its molecular weight.</p><p num="0105">Many issued patents disclose procedures for reacting high molecular weight
carboxylic acid acylating agents with alcohols to produce acidic esters and neutral
esters. These same techniques are applicable to preparing esters from the acylating
agents of this invention and the alcohols described above. All that is required is that
the acylating agents of this invention is substituted for the high molecular weight
carboxylic acid acylating agents discussed in these patents, usually on an equivalent
weight basis. The following U.S. patents are expressly incorporated herein by
reference for their disclosure of suitable methods for reacting the acylating agents of
this invention with the alcohols described above: U.S. Patents 3,331,776; 3,381,022;

with the amines as described above by substituting, or on an equivalent basis, the

viscosity, including natural or synthetic lubricating oils and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0131">Natural oils include animal oils and vegetable oils (e.g. castor oil, lard oil) as
well as mineral lubricating oils such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent-treated or
acid treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic or mixed
paraffinic-naphthenic types. Oils of lubricating viscosity derived from coal or shale
are also useful. Synthetic lubricating oils include hydrocarbon oils and
halosubstituted hydrocarbon oils such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins,
etc. and mixtures thereof, alkylbenzenes, polyphenyl, (e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls,
alkylated polyphenyls, etc.), alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl
sulfides and the derivatives, analogs and homologues thereof and the like. </p><p num="0132">Alkylene oxide polymers and interpolymers and derivatives thereof where
their terminal hydroxyl groups have been modified by esterification, etherification,
etc., constitute another useful class of known synthetic lubricating oils.</p><p num="0133">Another suitable class of synthetic lubricating oils that can be used comprises
the esters of di- and polycarboxylic acids and those made from C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>20</sub>
monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyolethers.</p> <p num="0134">Other synthetic lubricating oils include liquid esters of phosphorus-containing
acids, polymeric tetrahydrofurans and the like, silicon-based oils such as
the polyalkyl-, polyaryl-, polyalkoxy-, or polyaryloxy-siloxane oils and silicate
oils.</p> <p num="0135">Unrefined, refined and rerefined oils, either natural or synthetic (as well as
mixtures of two or more of any of these) of the type disclosed hereinabove can be
used in the compositions of the present invention. Unrefined oils are those obtained
directly from natural or synthetic sources without further purification treatment.
Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in
one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Refined oils
include solvent refined oils, hydrorefined oils, hydrofinished oils, hydrotreated oils,
and oils obtained by hydrocracking and hydroisomerization techniques.</p> <p num="0136">Rerefined oils are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain
refined oils applied to refined oils which have been already used in service. Such
rerefined oils often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of
spent additives and oil breakdown products.</p><p num="0137">Specific examples of the above-described oils of lubricating viscosity are
given in Chamberlin, III, U.S. 4,326,972, European Patent Publication 107,282, and

Brock, "Lubrication Engineering", Volume 43, pages 184-5, March, 1987, which 
article is expressly incorporated by reference for relevant disclosures contained,
therein.</p><heading><u style="single">Other Additives</u></heading><p num="0139">As mentioned, lubricating oil compositions of this invention may contain
other components. The use of such additives is optional and the presence thereof in
the compositions of this invention will depend on the particular use and level of
performance required. Thus the other additive may be included or excluded. The
compositions may comprise a zinc salt of a dithiophosphoric acid. Zinc salts of
dithiophosphoric acids are often referred to as zinc dithiophosphates, zinc O,O'-dihydrocarbyl
dithiophosphates, and other commonly used names. They are
sometimes referred to by the abbreviation ZDP. One or more zinc salts of
dithiophosphoric acids may be present in a minor amount to provide additional
extreme pressure, anti-wear and anti-oxidancy performance.</p><p num="0140">In addition to zinc salts of dithiophosphoric acids discussed hereinabove,
other additives that may optionally be used in the lubricating oils of this invention
include, for example, detergents, dispersants, viscosity improvers, oxidation
inhibiting agents, pour point depressing agents, extreme pressure agents, anti-wear
agents, color stabilizers and anti-foam agents. The above-mentioned dispersants and
viscosity improvers may be used in addition to the compositions of this invention.</p><p num="0141">Auxiliary extreme pressure agents and corrosion and oxidation inhibiting
agents which may be included in the compositions of the invention are exemplified
by chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, organic sulfides and polysulfides, phosphorus
esters including dihydrocarbon and trihydrocarbon phosphites, molybdenum
compounds, and the like.</p><p num="0142">Auxiliary viscosity improvers (also sometimes referred to as viscosity index
improvers or viscosity modifiers) may be included in the compositions of this
invention. Viscosity improvers are usually polymers, including polyisobutenes,
polymethacrylic acid esters, diene polymers, polyalkyl styrenes, esterified styrenemaleic
anhydride copolymers, alkenylarene-conjugated diene copolymers and
polyolefins. Multifunctional viscosity improvers, other than those of the present 
invention, which also have dispersant and/or antioxidancy properties are known and
may optionally be used in addition to the products of this invention. Such products
are described in numerous publications including those mentioned in the
Background of the Invention. Each of these publications is hereby expressly
incorporated by reference.</p><p num="0143">Pour point depressants are often included in the lubricating oils described
herein. See for example, page 8 of "Lubricant Additives" by C.V. Smalheer and R.
Kennedy Smith (Lezius-Hiles Company Publisher, Cleveland, Ohio, 1967). Pour
point depressants, techniques for their preparation and their use are described in U.
S. Patent numbers 2,387,501; 2,015,748; 2,655,479; 1,815,022; 2,191,498;
2,666,748; 2,721,877; 2,721,878; and 3,250,715 which are expressly incorporated
by reference for their relevant disclosures.</p><p num="0144">Anti-foam agents used to reduce or prevent the formation of stable foam
include silicones or organic polymers. Examples of these and additional anti-foam
compositions are described in "Foam Control Agents", by Henry T. Kerner (Noyes
Data Corporation, 1976), pages 125-162.</p><p num="0145">Detergents and dispersants may be of the ash-producing or ashless type. The
ash-producing detergents are exemplified by oil soluble neutral and basic salts of
alkali or alkaline earth metals with sulfonic acids, carboxylic acids, phenols or
organic phosphorus acids characterized by a least one direct carbon-to-phosphorus
linkage.</p><p num="0146">The term "basic salt" is used to designate metal salts wherein the metal is
present in stoichiometrically larger amounts than the organic acid radical. Basic
salts and techniques for preparing and using them are well known to those skilled in
the art and need not be discussed in detail here.</p><p num="0147">Ashless detergents and dispersants are so-called despite the fact that,
depending on its constitution, the detergent or dispersant may upon combustion
yield a nonvolatile residue such as boric oxide or phosphorus pentoxide; however, it
does not ordinarily contain metal and therefore does not yield a metal-containing ash 
on combustion. Many types are known in the art, and are suitable for use in the
lubricants of this invention. The following are illustrative:
<sl><li>(1) Reaction products of carboxylic acids (or derivatives thereof) containing
at least about 34 and preferably at least about 54 carbon atoms with nitrogen

and alcohols, and/or basic inorganic materials. Examples of these "carboxylic
dispersants" are described in British Patent number 1,306,529 and in many U.S.

Table 2 with that in Comp Table 2, it is seen that compositions of this invention
provide superior 100°C kinematic viscosities to lubricating oils than do
compositions that do not include the acylated terpolymer component in the
composition.</p><p num="0164">The compositions of this invention permit the preparation of lubricants
meeting 100°C kinematic viscosity standards when corresponding compositions
derived solely from acylated polyolefin fail to meet minimum 100°C kinematic
viscosity requirements.</p><p num="0165">When lubricants are used under shearing conditions, the viscosity of the
lubricant often diminishes with time. The compositions of this invention permit the
formulator to formulate lubricants at the higher end of the viscosity specification,
without an adverse effect on low temperature performance, resulting in lubricants
that "stay in grade" for a longer period of time.</p><heading><u style="single">The Normally Liquid Fuels</u></heading><p num="0166">As indicated hereinabove, the products of this invention may also be used
as additives for normally liquid fuels.</p><p num="0167">The fuels used in the fuel compositions of this invention are well known to
those skilled in the art and usually contain a major portion of a normally liquid fuel
such as hydrocarbonaceous petroleum distillate fuel (e.g., motor gasoline as defined
by ASTM Specifications D-439-89 and D-4814-91 and diesel fuel or fuel oil as 
defined in ASTM Specifications D-396-90 and D-975-91). Fuels containing non-hydrocarbonaceous
materials such a alcohols, ether, organo-nitro compounds and the
like, are also within the scope of this invention as are liquid fuels derived from
vegetable or mineral sources. A range of alcohol and ether type compounds are
described as oxygenates. Oxygenate-containing fuels are described in ASTM
D-4814-91. Mixtures of any of the above-described fuels are useful.</p><p num="0168">Particularly preferred fuels are gasoline, that is, a mixture of hydrocarbons
having an ASTM boiling point of 60°C at the 10% distillation point to about 205°C
at the 90% distillation point, oxygenates, and gasoline-oxygenate blends, all as
defined in the aforementioned ASTM Specifications for automotive gasolines. Most
preferred is gasoline.</p><p num="0169">The fuel compositions typically contain from about 0.001% to about 2% by
weight, more often up to about 0.5%, even more often up to about 0.2% by weight of
the additives of this invention.</p><p num="0170">The fuel compositions of the present invention may contain other additives
which are well known to those skilled in the art. These can include anti-knock
agents such as tetra-alkyl lead compounds, lead scavengers such as halo-alkanes,
dyes, antioxidants such as hindered phenols, rust inhibitors such as alkylated
succinic acids and anhydrides and derivatives thereof, bacteriostatic agents, auxiliary
dispersants and detergents, gum inhibitors, fluidizers, metal deactivators,
demulsifiers, anti-icing agents and the like. The fuel compositions of this invention
may be lead-containing or lead-free fuels. Preferred are lead-free fuels.</p><p num="0171">While the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred
embodiments, it is to be understood that various modifications thereof will become
apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the specification.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>A carboxylic composition comprising hydrocarbon substituted carboxylic
