The first stage is carried out in a dynamic mixer. The second stage is conducted in at least one reactor. The third stage is conducted in at least one material separating apparatus. The pressure in the reactor of the second stage is greater than or equal to the pressure in the dynamic mixer, and the pressure in at least one material separating apparatus being less than the pressure in the reactor of the second stage.</p><p num="p0002">It is known to prepare isocyanates from amines and phosgene. Depending on the type of amines, the reaction is carried out either in the gas phase or in the liquid phase and either batchwise or continuously (<nplcit id="ncit0001" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>W. Siefken, Liebigs Ann. 562, 75 (1949</text></nplcit>)).</p><p num="p0003">The continuous preparation of organic isocyanates by the reaction of primary organic amines has been described many times and is carried out on the industrial scale. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0002" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Kunststoffhandbuch, volume 7 (Polyurethane), 3rd revised edition; and Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich-Vienna, p. 76 et seq. (1993</text></nplcit>). In particular, the aromatic isocyanates TDI (toluene diisocyanate); MDI (methylenediphenyl diisocyanate), PMDI (polymethylenepolyphenylene polyisocyanate) and mixtures of the last two; and the aliphatic isocyanates HDI (hexamethylene diisocyanate) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), are prepared worldwide on an industrial scale.</p><p num="p0004">Modem industrial syntheses of the aromatic diisocyanates MDI and TDI and the aliphatic diisocyanates HDI and IPDI are carried out almost exclusively by continuous processes. A continuous process for carrying out the reaction in several continuous-flow vessels can be found, e.g., in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE844896A" status="new"><text>DE-A-844 896</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p num="p0005">The continuous embodiment of the process normally takes place in two stages. In the first stage of the phosgenation, the amine is reacted with phosgene to give the corresponding carbamoyl chloride, hydrogen chloride and amine hydrochloride. The reaction between amine and phosgene is very rapid and strongly exothermic and proceeds even at very low temperatures. To minimize by-product and solid formation, the amine and phosgene, both optionally in organic solvent, must therefore be mixed rapidly, so the first phosgenation stage normally takes place in a mixer, which is frequently a nozzle. In the second stage of the phosgenation, the carbamoyl chloride decomposes to form the desired isocyanate and hydrogen chloride and the amine hydrochloride is phosgenated to form the carbamoyl chloride. The temperature of the second phosgenation stage is normally higher than that of the first.</p><p num="p0006">The reaction of amine and phosgene in the liquid phase is very rapid at all the industrially conventional temperatures and pressures, so a good mixing of the reactants is sought in order to suppress secondary reactions. The phosgenation of primary amines in a mixer-reactor as the first stage of the phosgenation has accordingly been described many times.</p><p num="p0007">Mixers can basically be divided into dynamic mixers (e.g. stirrers, turbines or rotor-stator systems) and static mixers (e.g., Kenics mixers, Schaschlik mixers or SMV mixers, as well as jet mixers such as nozzles or T mixers (<nplcit id="ncit0003" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Fortschr.

In this process, an amine/monochlorobenzene mixture and a phosgene/monochlorobenzene mixture, split into several partial streams, are introduced in parallel into a reactor. A part of the phosgene/monochlorobenzene mixture is introduced centrally and the amine/monochlorobenzene mixture is introduced around this central stream. The amine/monochlorobenzene mixture in turn is enclosed by a phosgene/monochlorobenzene mixture. By way of example, the polyamine/monochlorobenzene mixture is fed annularly into the phosgenation reactor at 150°C. Before entering the reactor, the mixture is set into a rotating motion by means of an appropriate swirling device. A phosgene/monochlorobenzene mixture heated to 150°C is introduced into the reactor as co-reactant, in and around the polyamine/monochlorobenzene mixture. The relative speed of the two co-reactants is approx. 15 m/s.</p><p num="p0010"><patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="EP0830894A" status="new"><text>EP-A-0 830 894</text></patcit> describes a mixer reactor for the phosgenation of primary amines in which the inlet for one material is formed in the axis of the mixing chamber and the inlet for the (at least one) other material takes the form of a large number of nozzles arranged with rotational symmetry relative to the axis of the mixing chamber. Each of the nozzles has a bolt displaceable in the direction of the nozzle axis. The bolt is capable of freeing the nozzle of adhering solids.</p><p num="p0011">Many apparatuses have also become established for the second phosgenation stage, which is optionally used simultaneously as a phase separation tank. The preparation of isocyanates from the corresponding amines by phosgenation takes place in stirred-tank reactors (e.g., <patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="DE1468445" status="new"><text>DE-OS 14 68 445</text></patcit>), series of stirred-tank reactors (<patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="DE844896" status="new"><text>DE-PS 844 896</text></patcit>), packed reaction columns (e.g., <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="WO9954289A" status="new"><text>WO-A-99/54289</text></patcit>) or non-packed columns (e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0005" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Ullmanns Encyklopädie der technischen Chemie, 4th edition (1977), volume 13, page 351</text></nplcit> et seq.). Loop reactors are also used to create<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a recirculation system so as to allow sufficient residence time for a complete conversion in the case of a limited reaction volume (or holdup).</p><p num="p0012">The isocyanate synthesis commonly takes place in the first stage at a very low temperature and in the second stage at a markedly higher temperature in a holding apparatus. This procedure is frequently termed cold-hot phosgenation and is described, e.g., in W. Siefken, Liebigs Annalen der Chemie 562 (1949), page 96. Firstly, a suspension of the carbamoyl chloride and amine hydrochloride intermediates is prepared at a low temperature, especially 0°C or room temperature, but not exceeding 60°C, and this suspension is then converted to the isocyanate at higher temperatures, especially in the range between 100 and 200°C, in a holding apparatus. Such two-stage processes are described in</p><p num="p0013"><nplcit id="ncit0006" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Kunststoffhandbuch, volume 7, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich-Vienna, p. 76 et seq. (1993</text></nplcit>), and, e.g., in patents <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="DE2058032A" status="new"><text>DE-A-20 58 032</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="DE2153268A" status="new"><text>DE-A-21 53 268</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="DE1233854A" status="new"><text>DE-A-1 233 854</text></patcit>.</p><p num="p0014">A disadvantage of the two-stage procedure with a low temperature in the first stage and a high temperature in the second stage (cold-hot phosgenation) is the low reaction rates and hence low space-time yields due to the low temperatures in the first reaction stage. The low temperatures (high solubility of phosgene) and long reaction times (large reactors) moreover imply a high phosgene holdup, which is undesirable for safety reasons. Low temperatures are also problematic because of the massive precipitation of the carbamoyl chloride formed as an intermediate, which decomposes rapidly at elevated temperatures. This involves the risk of blockage and caked deposits. Furthermore, cooling of the reactants and subsequent heating of the reaction mixture is disadvantageous in energy terms. To achieve economic space-time yields, it is necessary to work at elevated temperature in all stages of industrial processes for the preparation of organic isocyanates by the phosgenation of primary organic amines. However, at high temperatures, the solubility of phosgene in the reaction mixture decreases and with it the phosgene excess available for the reaction, since the reaction normally takes<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> place in the liquid phase, but a large phosgene excess is required in order to obtain high yields of isocyanate. <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="EP0716079A" status="new"><text>EP-A-0 716 079</text></patcit> describes the influence of pressure and temperature on the reaction and the phosgene excess. The lowering of phosgene excess at higher temperatures is generally countered by an increased reaction pressure.</p><p num="p0015"><patcit id="pcit0024"  dnum="DE1768439" status="new"><text>DE-OS 17 68 439</text></patcit> describes a process for the continuous preparation of organic isocyanates which is characterized by the combination of a high temperature above 180°C and a high pressure of 20 to 150 atm, together with a high phosgene concentration in the region of the reaction.

The first stage is carried out in a dynamic mixer. The second stage is carried out in at least one reactor. The third stage is carried out in at least one material separating apparatus. The pressure in the reactor of the second stage is greater than or equal to the pressure in the dynamic mixer. The pressure in the at least one material separating apparatus is less than the pressure in the reactor of the second stage.</p><p num="p0059">In the first stage of the process according to the invention, basically the amine is converted to carbamoyl chloride and amine hydrochloride. In the second stage, basically the amine hydrochloride formed in the first stage is converted to carbamoyl chloride. In the third stage, basically the carbamoyl chloride is separated into isocyanate and hydrogen chloride. In the process according to the invention, the reaction between organic amine and phosgene is carried out in three<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> or more stages in an inert solvent, preferably toluene or chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene or a mixture thereof, and with excess phosgene. An essential feature of the invention is that the mixing takes place in a dynamic mixer, the pressure in the second stage reactor being greater than or equal to the pressure in the dynamic mixer, and the pressure in the separating apparatus being less than the pressure in the reactor of the second stage.</p><p num="p0060">The first phosgenation stage takes place in a dynamic mixer, preferably in a mixer reactor such as that described, e.g., in <patcit id="pcit0080" dnum="EP0291819B1" status="new"><text>EP 0 291 819 B1</text></patcit> in column 1/line 44 to column 2/line 49 and whose detailed construction is described in connection with Figures 1 and 2 at column 4/line 34 to column 5/line 46, preferably in a mixer reactor such as that described in <patcit id="pcit0081" dnum="EP0830894B1" status="new"><text>EP 0 830 894 B1</text></patcit> in paragraphs 0005 to 0011/0012 to 0014 and whose detailed construction is described in connection with Figures 1 to 4 in paragraphs 0016 to 0022.</p><p num="p0061">Suitable mixer reactors are those which:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>(1) have a mixing chamber and an upstream partition chamber in their housings of essentially rotational symmetry;</li><li>(2) permit introduction of at least the first material in the axis of the mixing chamber, e.g. via a bent tube entering the side of the partition chamber wall;</li><li>(3) permit the at least second material stream to pass into the partition chamber and reach the mixing chamber via a large number of parallel perforations concentric to the axis of the mixer reactors;</li><li>(4) have a mixing chamber containing rotor elements driven via a shaft and stator elements connected to the housing;</li><li>(5) have a mixing chamber outlet which can form an impeller that conveys the reaction mixture into the outlet tube of the stirred-tank reactor; and<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></li><li>(6) make it possible to mix the components under optimal conditions, independently of the throughput, by means of the external mechanical drive.</li></ul></p><p num="p0062">The mixer reactors disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0082" dnum="EP0830894B1" status="new"><text>EP 0 830 894 B1</text></patcit> advantageously differ from the mixer reactors disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0083" dnum="EP0291819A" status="new"><text>EP 0 291 819</text></patcit> B 1 in that:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>a) bolts are allocated to each of their perforations arranged with rotational symmetry relative to the axis of the mixing chamber;</li><li>b) these bolts can be moved by means of a common carrier ring and a shaft inserted through the housing of the partition chamber;</li><li>c) if caked deposits and/or blockages form in the perforations, the latter can be cleared by axial displacement of the bolts, and</li><li>d) non-productive times for cleaning the perforations can thus be reduced to a few seconds.</li></ul></p><p num="p0063">However, basically any dynamic mixer that assures intimate mixing by means of mechanically driven parts, for example, rotary mixing devices and especially multistage centrifugal pumps, are suitable for use in the first stage of the process of the present invention.</p><p num="p0064">The pressure in the dynamic mixer of the first stage is preferably from 3 to 70 bar and particularly preferably from 3 to 35 bar. The temperature in the first stage is preferably from 80 to 220°C and particularly preferably from 90 to 180°C.</p><p num="p0065">The second stage is carried out in at least one reactor, i.e. a holding apparatus suitable for carrying out chemical reactions, which is hydraulically connected to the dynamic mixer of the first stage. If there are two or more reactors in operation, these can be connected to one another in parallel or in series. The pressure in the second stage is preferably from 3 to 70 bar and particularly preferably from 3 to 37<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> bar. The temperature in the second stage is preferably from 80 to 220°C and particularly preferably from 90 to 180°C.</p><p num="p0066">Suitable types of reactor for the second stage are tubular reactors, stirred-tank reactors and non-mixed holding apparatuses. The reactor can also be provided with a pumped circuit, which in turn can contain a heat exchanger for adjusting the reactor temperature. Tubular reactors are particularly preferred.</p><p num="p0067">In the material separating apparatus of the third stage, the carbamoyl chloride is converted to the isocyanate and the reaction mixture is separated into a gas phase and a liquid phase. The gas phase is essentially composed of hydrogen chloride and, depending on the pressure and temperature, optionally, part of the excess phosgene used and part of the solvent vapors. The material separating apparatus of the third stage of the process according to the invention is operated at a pressure of from 0.5 to 20 bar and preferably of from 0.5 to 16 bar. Downstream of the reactor of the second stage, the pressure is expanded to the pressure of the material separating apparatus of the third stage via a valve or other device suitable for the purpose. The temperature of the third stage is from 80 to 220°C. In addition to heat exchangers with separate gas discharge, stirred-tank reactors, series of stirred-tank reactors, perforated-tray columns or other apparatuses for separating materials, a particularly suitable type of reactor for the material separating apparatus of the third stage is a (reaction) tower, for example, a (reaction) tower such as that disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0084" dnum="DE3736988C1" status="new"><text>DE-37 36 988 C1</text></patcit> at column 3, lines 2-64. The material separating apparatus of the third stage can also be utilized for removing the excess phosgene from the reaction mixture. Like the reactor of the second stage, the material separating apparatus of the third stage can also be disadvantageously large. In this case it can alternatively take the form of two or more identical or different apparatuses, preferably, a combination of heat exchanger with separate gas discharge and (reaction) tower, or a combination of (reaction) tower/towers and (reaction) column, which are preferably connected in series in both cases.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><p num="p0068">The reaction mixture discharged from the third stage is then preferably worked up by conventional methods to remove any phosgene still present and to separate off the solvent. This can be followed by other work-up steps; for example, in the case of the preparation of TDI, the crude TDI is subjected to separation of the high boilers and to purification by distillation. Phosgene, hydrogen chloride and optionally solvent are separated in known manner from the vapors from the material separating apparatus of the third stage and, if appropriate, the reactor of the second stage, and optionally recycled.</p><p num="p0069">The solvents used are preferably chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene or mixtures thereof; aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene, benzene, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane or biphenyl; ketones, such as 2-butanone or methyl isobutyl ketone; esters, such as diethyl isophthalate, ethyl acetate or butyl acetate; or nitriles, such as acetonitrile; and sulfolane.</p><p num="p0070">The advantages of the process according to the invention is that, in contrast to the conventional processes according to the state of the art include:
<ol><li>1. the two reaction steps, phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride to carbamoyl chloride and decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride to isocyanate and hydrogen chloride, are partially or completely carried out in separate stages or reactors, making it possible for very high chemical yields, very high space-time yields and at the same time a very low phosgene holdup to be achieved by the mutually independent adjustment of the optimal pressure and optimal temperature for each particular reaction and by the choice of the most favorable reactor design in each case; and</li><li>2. the good mixing of the reactants in the first reaction stage, which is necessary for the rapid reaction between amine and phosgene to give carbamoyl chloride and hydrogen chloride with the production of very small amine hydrochloride particles, is always assured in this stage,<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> extensively independently of load, by the use of a dynamic mixer, because the mechanically driven mixing devices can be loaded within very wide limits without loss of the ability to create optimal mixing conditions for the reactants of the first stage.

The process of the present invention can be carried out adiabatically or isothermally. The differences in apparatus design are determined on the basis of the conditions of all the reactions, particularly those of the phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride to carbamoyl chloride and the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride to isocyanate and hydrogen chloride. While high pressures are required for the phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride, low pressures are advantageous for the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride. Shorter residence times can be chosen for the amine hydrochloride phosgenation reactor than for the carbamoyl chloride decomposition, markedly reducing the overall phosgene holdup. Removal of the hydrogen chloride formed is advantageous for the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride because the carbamoyl chloride/isocyanate equilibrium is thereby shifted in favor of the desired isocyanate. Special attention can be paid to this by choosing a heat exchanger with separate gas discharge or a combination of (reaction) tower/ towers and (reaction) column, connected in series, as apparatuses for the third stage. Excess phosgene can also be removed at the same time. However, removal of the excess phosgene in this stage is not compulsory and it can also be carried out in a subsequent stage.</li></ol></p><p num="p0071">In contrast, the removal of hydrogen chloride from the reactor of the second stage would be very disadvantageous because (1) the by-product formation of the isocyanate with amine hydrochloride is favored by shifting the carbamoyl chloride/isocyanate equilibrium towards the isocyanate; (2) the phosgene required for phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride would also be removed together with the hydrogen chloride; and (3) hydrogen chloride gas released from the reaction mixture, and particularly evaporating phosgene, cause cooling of the reaction<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> mixture, which could lead to the massive precipitation of solid carbamoyl chloride and amine hydrochloride.</p><p num="p0072">For good chemical yields afforded by low by-product formation, the reaction conditions of the first and second stages required for the rapid reactions between amine and phosgene to give carbamoyl chloride and hydrogen chloride and between hydrogen chloride and amine to give amine hydrochloride, as well as the reaction of the amine hydrochloride with phosgene to give carbamoyl chloride, are high pressures, which make it possible to achieve high phosgene concentrations in the liquid phase and hence large phosgene excesses. Also, good mixing of the reactants in the first stage is always necessary for the production of very small amine hydrochloride particles, which is why the process according to the invention uses a dynamic mixer to allow the introduction of large mixing energies extensively independently of load.</p><p num="p0073">As shown for the first time in <patcit id="pcit0085" dnum="WO2004056756A" status="new"><text>WO-A-2004/056756</text></patcit>, dissolved amine hydrochloride and very small amine hydrochloride particles react very rapidly with phosgene at high phosgene concentrations and elevated temperatures, in contradiction of the general teaching of the prior art. Surprisingly, however, contrary to <patcit id="pcit0086" dnum="WO2004056756A" status="new"><text>WO-A-2004/056756</text></patcit>, correspondingly reactive amine hydrochloride particles can be produced and reacted when the pressure in the reactor of the second stage is greater than or equal to the pressure in the dynamic mixer, and the pressure in the at least one material separating apparatus of the third stage is smaller than the pressure in the reactor of the second stage. Dissolved amine and the amine hydrochloride particles obtained therefrom react very rapidly with phosgene in the reactor of the second stage and therefore do not need a long residence time. High phosgene concentrations are advantageous here. Higher pressures do not have a disadvantageous effect on the phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride, so higher phosgene concentrations in the liquid phase can preferably be obtained by means of higher pressures. Heatable reactors for the<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> second stage are advantageous because they enable compensation for any drops in temperature due to the endothermic decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride.</p><p num="p0074">The main reaction in the third stage, i.e. the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride to isocyanate and hydrogen chloride, is a pressure-dependent equilibrium reaction. It is shifted by low pressures in favor of the desired isocyanate. As this reaction does not require phosgene, the low phosgene concentrations in the liquid phase that are characteristic of low pressures do not interfere. To the contrary, they result in a low phosgene holdup in the material separating apparatus of the third stage, which is favorable in terms of safety. The phosgene holdup in the overall process, but optionally also in individual apparatuses, can thus be markedly reduced in comparison with conventional processes in a series of stirred-tank reactors or a reaction tower.</p><p num="p0075">The phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride does not have to go to completion in the second stage. By the same token, the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride can start in the second stage. Preferably, however, the design of the reactor of the second stage with respect to residence time and other process engineering parameters is such that the phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride is as complete as possible and the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride has advanced as little as possible.</p><p num="p0076">If the phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride and the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride are carried out in one stage or in one reactor, according to the state of the art, the pressure required for the phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride causes a low conversion of the carbamoyl chloride to isocyanate and hence long residence times. A high phosgene concentration and long residence times (large reaction volumes) in turn mean a very large phosgene holdup. This also occurs at high pressures and temperatures, which give rise to safety concerns. Spatial separation of the two reactions - the phosgenation of the amine hydrochloride at high pressure in the second phosgenation stage and the decomposition of the carbamoyl chloride at low pressure in the third phosgenation<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> stage - affords high chemical yields, high space-time yields and especially a low phosgene holdup in the overall process and optionally also in the individual apparatuses.</p><p num="p0077">Spatial separation of the first and second stages is not absolutely necessary because a high pressure increases the phosgene concentration in the liquid phase, which benefits both the first reaction between amine and phosgene and the second reaction between amine hydrochloride and phosgene. In addition, the mixing of the reactants takes place very rapidly in a dynamic mixer, so, even if the first and second stages of the process take place in a common apparatus, firstly the mixing of the reactants takes place in the region of the dynamic mixer, and then the subsequent reaction takes place in the holding region of the common apparatus.</p><p num="p0078">Furthermore, the process can be carried out in all stages at elevated temperature and optionally also isothermally. In particular, compared with conventional cold-hot phosgenations, this achieves high space-time yields and hence low phosgene holdups and uses smaller apparatuses coupled with higher chemical yields. Also, an appreciable amount of energy is saved by avoiding the need to cool the reaction mixture in the first stage and then reheat it in the second and subsequent stages. By avoiding the precipitation of amine hydrochloride as a solid, it is possible to avoid long residence times, as can be achieved in some cases only by a recirculation system (loop reactors). Although the recirculation system also has a low phosgene holdup, for example as a series of stirred-tank reactors, it is characterized by an increased formation of by-products, especially ureas. To avoid urea formation, the amine or isocyanate concentration has to be kept low, resulting in very low space-time yields.</p><p num="p0079">The temperatures and pressures used depend to some extent on the amine used. Preferably, the phosgene excess should be at least 70% of the stoichiometric input in the case of diphenylmethane diisocyanates (MDI) and/or polyphenylenepolymethylene polyisocyanate (PMDI) or mixtures of the two, at least 150% of the stoichiometric input in the case of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and isophorone<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> diisocyanate (IPDI), and at least 250% of the stoichiometric input in the case of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI).</p><p num="p0080">The residence time in the first stage (dynamic mixer) is conventionally very short and defined by the apparatus design. It ranges from 0.1 to 60 seconds and preferably from 0.1 to 10 seconds. The mean residence time in the reactor of the second stage can preferably be between 1 second and 30 minutes. Mean residence times of 5 seconds to 10 minutes are particularly preferred and mean residence times of between 10 seconds and 5 minutes are very particularly preferred. The mean residence time of the reaction mixture in the material separating apparatus or in the corresponding combined apparatus of the third stage, for example the heat exchanger with separate gas discharge, the (reaction) tower or the combination of (reaction) tower and (reaction) column, connected in series, also depends on their design and loading.
