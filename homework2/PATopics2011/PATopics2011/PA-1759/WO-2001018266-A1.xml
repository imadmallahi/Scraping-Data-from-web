ZINC FROM ZINC BEARING SULPHIDE MINERALS BY BIOLEACHING AND ELECTROWTN- NING</p><p num="p0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0003">This invention relates to the recovery of zinc from zinc bearing sulphide minerals</p><p num="p0004">Commercial bioleach plants which are currently in operation treating sulphide minerals, typically operate within the temperature range of 40°C to 50°C and rely on sparging air to the bioleach reactors to provide the required oxygen Operation at this relatively low temperature and the use of air to supply oxygen, limit the rate of sulphide mineral oxidation that can be achieved</p><p num="p0005">The use of high temperatures between 50°C and 100°C greatly increases the rate of sulphide mineral leaching</p><p num="p0006">The solubility of oxygen is however limited at high temperatures and the rate of sulphide mineral leaching becomes limited In the case of using air for the supply of oxygen, the effect of limited oxygen solubility is such that the rate of sulphide mineral leaching becomes dependent on and is limited by the rate of oxygen transfer from the gas to the liquid phase <sup>(1 2&gt;</sup></p><p num="p0007">The bioleaching of zinc sulphide minerals is similarly problematic and to the applicant s knowledge no commercial zinc bioleaching plant is in operation</p><p num="p0008">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0009">The invention provides a method of recovering zinc from a zinc bearing sulphide mineral slurry which includes the steps of</p><p num="p0010">(a) subjecting the slurry to a bioleaching process</p><p num="p0011">(b) supplying a feed gas which contains in excess of 21% oxygen by volume to the slurry, and</p><p num="p0012">(c) recoveπng zinc from a bioleach residue of the bioleaching process 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
If the slurry contains copper then preferably copper is removed from the bioleach residue before recoveπng zinc from the slurry</p><p num="p0013">The method may include the step of removing iron from the bioleach residue before recoveπng zinc therefrom This may be done in any appropriate way and preferably the iron is precipitated from the bioleach residue by the addition of limestone to the slurry</p><p num="p0014">Zinc may be extracted from the residue in any appropπate way In one form of the invention the bioleach residue is subjected to a recovery process which includes solvent extraction and an electrowinning process to produce zinc metal cathodes</p><p num="p0015">Oxygen generated during the zinc electrowinning step may be fed to the feed gas of step (b) or directly to the slurry</p><p num="p0016">Raffinate produced during the solvent extraction step may be supplied to at least one of the following the bioleaching process of step (a), an external heap leach process, and a zinc oxide leach step</p><p num="p0017">As used herein "zinc oxide' includes ores or concentrates containing non-sulphide zinc minerals</p><p num="p0018">Acid in the raffinate may be neutralised to produce gypsum and carbon dioxide and to precipitate any co- leached iron</p><p num="p0019">The neutralisation may be effected by adding limestone or zinc oxide to the raffinate</p><p num="p0020">At least some of the carbon dioxide produced during the neutralisation step may be supplied to the bioleaching process of step (a)

As used herein the expression "oxygen enπched gas" is intended to include a gas, e.g. air, which contains in excess of 21% oxygen by volume This is an oxygen content greater than the oxygen content of air The expression "pure oxygen" is intended to include a gas which contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume. Preferably the feed gas which is supplied to the slurry contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume i.e. is substantially pure oxygen</p><p num="p0021">The method may include the step of maintaining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a desired range which may be determined by the operating conditions and the type of microorganisms used for leachmg The applicant has established that a lower limit for the dissolved oxygen concentration to sustain microorganism growth and mineral oxidation, is in the range of from 0.2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 4.0 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> On the other hand if the dissolved oxygen concentration is too high then microorganism growth is inhibited The upper threshold concentration also depends on the genus and strain of microorganism used in the leachmg process and typically is in the range of from 4 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0022">Thus, preferably, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry is maintained in the range of from 0 2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to l O x lO^ kg/m<sup>3</sup> </p><p num="p0023">The method may include the steps of determining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry and, in response thereto, of controlling at least one of the following the oxygen content of the feed gas, the rate of supply of the feed gas to the slurry, and the rate of feed of slurry to a reactor</p><p num="p0024">The dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry may be determined in any appropriate way, e g by one or more of the following by direct measurement of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, by measurement of the oxygen content in gas above the slurry, and indirectly by measurement of the oxygen content in off-gas from the slurry taking into account the rate of oxygen supply whether in gas enriched or pure form, to the slurry, and other relevant factors 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
The method may include the step of controlling the carbon content of the slurry. This may be achieved by one or more of the following: the addition of carbon dioxide gas to the slurry, and the addition of other carbonaceous material to the slurry.</p><p num="p0025">The method may extend to the step of controlling the carbon dioxide content of the feed gas to the slurry in the range of from 0.5% to 5% by volume. A suitable figure is of the order of 1% to 1.5% by volume. The level of the carbon dioxide is chosen to maintain high rates of microorganism growth and sulphide mineral oxidation.</p><p num="p0026">The bioleaching process is preferably carried out at an elevated temperature. As stated hereinbefore the bioleaching rate increases with an increase in operating temperature. Clearly the microorganisms which are used for bioleaching are determined by the operating temperature and vice versa. As the addition of oxygen enriched gas or substantially pure oxygen to the slurry has a cost factor it is desirable to operate at a temperature which increases the leaching rate by an amount which more than compensates for the increase in operating cost. Thus, preferably, the bioleaching is carried out at a temperature in excess of 40°C.</p> <p num="p0027">The bioleaching may be carried out at a temperature of up to 100°C or more and preferably is carried out at a temperature which lies in a range of from 60°C to 85°C.</p> <p num="p0028">In one form of the invention the method includes the step of bioleaching the slurry at a temperature of up to 45°C using mesophile microorganisms. These microorganisms may, for example, be selected from the following genus groups: Acidithiobacillus (formerly Thiobacillus); Leptosprillum; Ferromicrobium; and Acidiphilium.</p> <p num="p0029">In order to operate at this temperature the said microorganisms may, for example, be selected from the following species:</p><p num="p0030">Acidithiobacillus caldus (Thiobacillus caldus); Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (Thiobacillus thiooxidans); Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans); Acidithiobacillus acidophilus (Thiobacillus

microorganisms at a temperature in excess of 40°C, controlling the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a predetermined range, and recovering zinc from a bioleach residue.</p><p num="p0039">Preferably the bioleaching is carried out at a temperature in excess of 60°C.</p><p num="p0040">The dissolved oxygen concentration may be controlled by controlling the addition of gas which contains in excess of 21 % oxygen by volume to the slurry.</p><p num="p0041">Preferably the gas contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume.</p><p num="p0042">The bioleach residue may be subjected to a separation step to produce residue solids and solution, and the zinc may be recovered from the solution in any appropriate way.</p><p num="p0043">The invention also extends to a method of enhancing the oxygen mass transfer coefficient from a gas phase to a liquid phase in a zinc bearing sulphide slurry which includes the step of supplying a feed gas containing in excess of 21% oxygen by volume to the slurry.</p><p num="p0044">The invention further extends to a plant for recovering zinc from a zinc bearing sulphide mineral slurry which includes a reactor vessel, a source which feeds a zinc bearing sulphide mineral slurry to the vessel, an oxygen source, a device which measures the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry in the vessel, a control mechanism whereby, in response to the said measure of dissolved oxygen concentration, the supply of oxygen from the oxygen source to the slurry is controlled to achieve a dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a predetermined range, and a recovery system which recovers zinc from a bioleach residue from the reactor vessel.</p><p num="p0045">The said dissolved oxygen concentration may be controlled by controlling the supply of oxygen to the slurry.</p><p num="p0046">The oxygen may be supplied to the slurry in the form of oxygen enriched gas or substantially pure oxygen. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
The reactor vessel may be operated at a temperature in excess of 60°C and preferably in the range of 60°C to 85°C.</p><p num="p0047">The invention further extends to a method of bioleaching an aqueous slurry containing zinc sulphide minerals which includes the steps of bioleaching the slurry at a temperature above 60°C, and maintaining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry in the range of from 0.2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p num="p0048">Vanous techniques may be used for controlling the supply of oxygen to the slurry and hence for controlling the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry at a desired value Use may for example be made of valves which are operated manually For more accurate control use may be made of an automatic control system These techniques are known in the art and are not further descnbed herein</p><p num="p0049">As has been indicated oxygen and carbon dioxide may be added to the slurry in accordance with predetermined cπtena Although the addition of these materials may be based on expected demand and measurement of other performance parameters, such as ιron(ll) concentration, it is preferred to make use of suitable measurement probes to sample the actual values of the critical parameters.</p><p num="p0050">For example use may be made of a dissolved oxygen probe to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry directly To achieve this the probe is immersed in the slurry The dissolved oxygen concentration may be measured indirectly by using a probe in the reactor off-gas or by transmitting a sample of the off-gas, at regular intervals, to an oxygen gas analyser Again it is pointed out that measuring techniques of this type are known in the art and accordingly any appropriate technique can be used</p><p num="p0051">A preferred approach to the control aspect is to utilise one or more probes to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, whether directly or indirectly The probes produce one or more control signals which are used to control the operation of a suitable valve or valves, e g solenoid valves, automatically so that the supply of oxygen to an air stream which is being fed to the slurry is varied automatically in accordance with real time measurements of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
Although it is preferred to control the addition of oxygen to a gas stream which is fed to the slurry a reverse approach may be adopted in that the oxygen supply rate to the reactor vessel may be maintained substantially constant and the rate of supply of the sulphide mineral slurry to the reactor vessel may be vaπed to achieve a desired dissolved oxygen concentration</p><p num="p0052">The invention is not limited to the actual control technique employed and is intended to extend to vanations of the aforegoing approaches and to any equivalent process</p><p num="p0053">Sphalerite, a commonly occurπng zinc sulphide mineral is of particular benefit, because it has a high leachmg rate, even at typical mesophile operating temperatures, which is further increased at the higher temperatures used with moderate and extreme thermophiles Thus the benefits of the invention including a high specific reactor sulphide oxidation duty and reduced specific power requirement for oxidation, are obtained during the bioleaching of zinc beaπng sulphide concentrates, even at mesophile operating temperatures</p><p num="p0054">Bioleaching fixes the sulphur in the sulphide concentrate ultimately as gypsum, rather than as sulphuric acid in conventional processes Thus there always exists the need to fix sulphur as gypsum If oxide zinc beanng ore or concentrates are available they usually have a significant carbonate related gangue acid requirement The gangue acid requirement can therefore be used to fix sulphur as gypsum simultaneously solubilising the zinc content reducing or eliminating the need for additional sulphuric acid for the treatment of these zinc oxide matenals For example a zinc oxide ore with a gangue acid consumption of 200kg sulphuric acid per tonne of ore could be processed using the acid generated from a zinc sulphide bioleach If only 50% of the zinc oxide ore sulphuric acid requirement were to be met in this way, a 1 million tonnes per annum oxide leach would save US$5 million per annum at a sulphuric acid pπce of USS50 per tonne The dilute sulphuric acid used for leachmg of these zinc oxide matenals would come either from a solvent extraction raffinate or from spent electrolyte depending on the route chosen for zinc recovery 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
Zinc may be recovered from solution by any appropriate process, for example by direct electrowinning, (after purification of the solution by zinc dust precipitation), by solvent extraction or by resm-in-pulp (applied to the slurry), followed by electrowinning</p><p num="p0055">If electrowinning is selected as the production method for zinc, the oxygen generated at the anode in the electrowinning process may be used to supplement that used in the bioleach process, reducing the capital and operating costs required for oxygen production</p><p num="p0056">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p><p num="p0057">The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a portion of a plant in which the invention is earned out, Figures 2 to 4 show vaπous results and parameters obtained from operating a bioreactor in the manner described herein with reference to Figure 1 , Figure 5 is a flow chart of a zinc recovery process according to the invention, and Figure 6 illustrates a vaπation to the process shown in Figure 5.</p><p num="p0058">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</p><p num="p0059">General Principles</p><p num="p0060">The limitation of low oxygen solubility duπng bioleaching, using air, at high temperatures, which in turn limits the rate of reaction requires enrichment of the air with oxygen i e air with an oxygen content greater than 21 % by volume, or the use of pure oxygen (defined as being greater than 85% oxygen by volume) The use of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen overcomes the limited rate of reaction due to oxygen supply constraints, but has two major disadvantages a) the provision of oxygen enπched air or pure oxygen is expensive and requires a high utilisation (&gt;60%) of the oxygen to warrant the additional expense <sup>(3)</sup>, and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
