Campbell) found at http://www.c2p2online.com/documents/FinalNPEAlternativesPublicReport.pdf </text></nplcit>and the rate of growth between 2003 and 2008 is projected at about 3.4 percent.</p><p num="p0003">Worldwide, the majority of ethoxylates used in detergents are produced via semi-batch processes utilizing base catalysis, typically potassium hydroxide ("KOH"). As such ethoxylates are commodity materials, the production economics and capability to manufacture the precursors are important determinants of profitability. Currently, only a small fraction of such surfactants are produced with specialized catalysts which give a narrow molecular weight distribution. Processes employing such "peaked catalysts" are reported to have higher manufacturing costs, likely related to higher catalyst costs and the need for catalyst removal following the ethoxylation process. Although the narrow distribution products from such processes can give higher performance in most applications, the cost driven focus of the detergent industry dictates the use of the KOH-catalyzed, wide distribution products because the benefits of enhanced performance are not sufficient to offset the increased costs.</p><p num="p0004">The semi-batch process is the industry standard and although it is has been optimized and refined, there remain disadvantages to the use of this process. The semi-batch process operates with a headspace of ethylene oxide and an inerting gas and there are several nonproductive steps in the reactor sequence. Because pure ethylene oxide can present a hazard, the headspace must be inerted with nitrogen or low oxygen content gas and at the end of the cycle this inerting gas which may<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> contain traces of ethylene oxide must be wasted. In the sequence of nonproductive steps: the alcohol is charged followed by catalyst and then the base is converted to the potassium or sodium alkoxide by stripping to remove water after the mixture is heated to process temperature. After oxide addition and digestion, the product is pumped from the reactor. Overall, the nonproductive steps can account for 50% of the reactor cycle time.</p><p num="p0005">The use of double metal cyanide ("DMC") catalysts for the production of alkoxylates has been known since General Tire's development in the 1960's. In the 1970's, Herold in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US3829505A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 3,829,505</text></patcit>, described the preparation of high molecular weight diols, triols etc., using double metal cyanide catalysts. However, the catalyst activity, coupled with catalyst cost and the difficulty of removing catalyst residues from the polyol product, prevented commercialization of the products. There was limited utilization of the DMC technology until the 1990's when Le-Khac, in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5470813A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,470,813</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5482908A" status="new"><text>5,482,908</text></patcit>, demonstrated both improved catalysts and processes technologies that lowered the cost of production for polyols to be competitive with that for potassium hydroxide-based process for a wide range of polyols. However, even with these advancements, DMC catalyst technology has been applied mostly to the production of mixed oxide and all propylene oxide-based polyols.</p><p num="p0006">Because of its unique features, the DMC catalyst provides a poor distribution of ethylene oxide when the equivalent weight of the base polyol is greater than about 800. The production of ethylene oxide ("EO") capped polyols suitable for use in polyurethanes requires either a two-stage system of DMC and potassium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide alone as the catalyst. Thus, although DMC catalysts are very effective for the production of ethoxylates when the starter equivalent weight is less than about 800, these capped low molecular weight polyols are not widely used for the production of polyurethanes.</p><p num="p0007">The use of DMC as a catalyst for the production of semi-batch ethoxylates is disclosed in a number of patents and patent applications. For example, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6821308B" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 6,821,308</text></patcit>, issued Combs et al., teaches the alkoxylation of alcohols with DMC. Although they demonstrate the use of propylene oxide as the alkylene oxide, Combs et al. do not teach or suggest the use of pure ethylene oxide.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p num="p0008"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO0014045A" status="new"><text>WO 00/14045</text></patcit> in the name of Grosch et al., teaches the preparation of ethoxylates of fatty alcohols using supported DMC catalysts along with propoxylation. Grosch et al. limit the range of alcohols used to C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>24</sub>, thus eliminating the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> alcohols likely because the lower molecular weight alcohols would act as inhibitors for catalyst activation in the semi-batch process.</p><p num="p0009">Ruland et al., in Example 1 of <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US20050215452A" status="new"><text>U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2005/0215452</text></patcit>, ethoxylate a 2-propylheptanol with five moles of ethylene oxide in the presence of a DMC catalyst.

It is likely that the process disclosed by Eleveld et al. will be unable to provide the economics needed to supply the majority of commodity surfactants, because many of the current highly optimized KOH processes operate in a heat exchange-limited mode and the use of another catalyst will not offset this limitation and this process retains the nonproductive steps of the semibatch process. Eleveld et al. report that DMC catalyzed semi-batch processes give narrow polydispersities in comparison with potassium hydroxide catalyzed processes; however, they do not disclose a method for surfactants having equivalent polydispersities.</p><p num="p0011">Walker et al., in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="WO0104178A" status="new"><text>WO 01/04178</text></patcit>, give several examples of ethoxylation.

The inventive continuous processes produce an ethoxylate from a C<sub>1</sub> - C<sub>26</sub> non-phenolic alcohol in the presence of a double metal cyanide ("DMC") catalyst. The inventive multi-stage continuous process produces an ethoxylate product with a molecular weight distribution that is the same or narrower as that of the equivalent base-catalyzed ethoxylate. The inventive single-stage continuous process produces ethoxylate products having only a slightly broader molecular weight distribution than the multi-stage process. The essentially equivalent molecular weight distribution possible with the inventive multi-stage continuous process may provide advantages where the ethoxylate product is used in or as a surfactant.</p><p num="p0018">These and other advantages and benefits of the present invention will be apparent from the Detailed Description of the Invention herein below.</p><heading><b><u style="single">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</u></b></heading><p num="p0019">The present invention will now be described for purposes of illustration and not limitation in conjunction with the figures, wherein:

Except in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities, percentages, OH numbers, functionalities and so forth in the specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Equivalent weights and molecular weights given herein in Daltons (Da) are number average equivalent weights and number average molecular weights respectively, unless indicated otherwise.</p><p num="p0021">The present invention provides a multi-stage continuous process for the production of an ethoxylate involving preparing a mixture of a C<sub>1</sub> - C<sub>26</sub> non-phenolic alcohol and a double metal cyanide ("DMC") catalyst, establishing ethoxylation conditions in a first continuous stirred tank reactor ("CSTR"), continuously feeding ethylene oxide and the mixture of C<sub>1</sub> - C<sub>26</sub> non-phenolic alcohol and DMC catalyst to the first CSTR reactor under conditions suitable to produce an ethoxylate, continuously feeding the reaction mixture from the first CSTR reactor and further ethylene oxide to a second CSTR reactor or to a tubular reactor under conditions suitable to produce an ethoxylate product and continuously withdrawing the ethoxylate product from the second CSTR reactor or tubular reactor to a collection vessel, wherein the ethoxylate product has a molecular weight distribution that is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> essentially equivalent to that of the same ethoxylate product produced by basic catalysis.</p><p num="p0022">The present invention also provides a multi-stage continuous process for the production of an ethoxylate involving preparing a mixture of a C<sub>1</sub> - C<sub>26</sub> non-phenolic alcohol and a double metal cyanide ("DMC") catalyst, establishing ethoxylation conditions in a first portion of a partitioned continuous stirred tank reactor ("CSTR"), continuously feeding ethylene oxide and the mixture of C<sub>1</sub> - C<sub>26</sub> non-phenolic alcohol and DMC catalyst to the first portion of the CSTR reactor under conditions suitable to produce an ethoxylate, continuously forcing the reaction mixture from the first portion of the CSTR reactor into a second portion of the CSTR reactor and adding further ethylene oxide under conditions suitable to produce an ethoxylate product and continuously withdrawing the ethoxylate product from the second portion of the CSTR reactor to a collection vessel, wherein the ethoxylate product has a molecular weight distribution that is essentially equivalent to that of the same ethoxylate product produced by basic catalysis.</p><p num="p0023">The present invention further provides a single-stage continuous process for the production of an ethoxylate involving preparing a mixture of a C<sub>1</sub> - C<sub>26</sub> non-phenolic alcohol and a double metal cyanide ("DMC") catalyst, establishing ethoxylation conditions in a reactor, continuously feeding ethylene oxide and the mixture of C<sub>1</sub>- C<sub>26</sub> non-phenolic alcohol and DMC catalyst to the reactor under conditions suitable to produce an ethoxylate, continuously feeding further ethylene oxide to the reactor under conditions suitable to produce an ethoxylate product and continuously withdrawing the ethoxylate product from the reactor to a collection vessel, wherein the ethoxylate product has a molecular weight distribution that is substantially similar to that of the same ethoxylate product produced by basic catalysis.</p><p num="p0024">The present invention yet further provides an improved process for the production of a surfactant, the improvement involving including the ethoxylate product produced by either of the inventive multi-stage continuous processes or by the inventive single-stage process.</p><p num="p0025">The present inventors have found that the polydispersities of the ethoxylates prepared with a continuous process using DMC catalysis are similar to those obtained using a semi-batch potassium hydroxide-catalyzed process. It is surprising that the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> inventive multi-stage continuous process is able to produce an ethoxylate with the same or narrower molecular weight distribution as compared to the equivalent commercial base-catalyzed ethoxylate.</p><p num="p0026">Such similar polydispersities are unexpected based on the published art and on the knowledge of those skilled in the art, regarding polydispersities of the polypropylene oxide polyols and mixed polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide polyols. With such polymers, the polydispersities are typically wider for the continuous products (DMC) process than the polydispersities of the products produced in the semibatch (KOH) process. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> compares the polydispersity of a 3,200 MW KOH-catalyzed triol with an 11.5 percent ethylene oxide content and a 3,000 MW DMC-catalyzed triol with an ethylene oxide content of 7.4 percent. <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> compares the polydispersity of 1,000 MW all propylene oxide diols made by KOH catalysis and by DMC catalysis. In both cases, the DMC-catalyzed materials show a broader polydispersity.</p><p num="p0027">As those skilled in the art are aware in transitioning from one manufacturing process to another, one of the key requirements is that the products have similar properties. It is known in the art that the relative surfactancy of a given weight of ethoxylates is related to the product distribution of the ethoxylates and thus it is desirable to maintain consistent properties. The inventive continuous processes provide the desired product quality combined with increases in productivity.</p><p num="p0028">The inventive continuous processes eliminate the nonproductive sequences required for the semi-batch process. Once the startup is achieved, the reactor is fully utilized for alkoxylation. The catalyst, starter and ethylene oxide are continuously charged with no heat-up or water removal stages. The addition of the starter at ambient temperature is an advantage as the heat of reaction is used to bring it to process temperature. The catalyst in the reactor has on-going activity and new catalyst is continually activated as the process proceeds. The products flows from the reactor and the last traces of ethylene oxide are eliminated either in the piping system, in a short pipe reactor or in the product analysis tank. If the system is equipped with analytical instruments such as a near-infrared detector, product variability is low as incremental starter and ethylene oxide weight changes can be made to maintain product quality.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p num="p0029">At the end of each of these processes, the product may contain a low level of unreacted ethylene oxide. The oxide level continues to decrease as the product flows from the reactor by pipes to product analysis tanks. An alternative to the use of these lines would be a pipe or plug-flow reactor in which no oxide is added. In addition, any residual oxide would continue to be reduced while the ethoxylate was in the product tank.</p><p num="p0030">Preferred initiators or starters (the terms are used interchangeably herein) in the inventive single-stage and multi-stage processes are non-phenolic alcohols of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and more preferably from 9 to 13 carbon atoms. The non-phenolic alcohol may have a number of carbon atoms in the present invention in an amount ranging between any combination of these values, inclusive of the recited values. The non-phenolic alcohol may be a primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol.</p><p num="p0031">Other suitable initiators include alcohols derived from coconut oil, palm oil, soybean oil etc. and hydroxyl-containing materials such as castor oil, hydroxylated vegetable oils, hydroxymethyl stearate and esters such as methyl ricinoleate (derived from castor oil). Other starters include hydroxylated esters such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or hydroxypropyl acrylate.</p><p num="p0032">The processes of the present invention may employ any double metal cyanide ("DMC") catalyst. Double metal cyanide complex catalysts are non-stoichiometric complexes of a low molecular weight organic complexing agent and optionally other complexing agents with a double metal cyanide salt, e.g. zinc hexacyanocobaltate. Suitable DMC catalysts are known to those skilled in the art. Exemplary DMC catalysts include those suitable for preparation of low unsaturation polyoxyalkylene polyether polyols, such as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US3427256A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat.

The multi-stage process may also take place in a partitioned CSTR reactor allowing a single vessel to serve as a multi-stage CSTR by partitioning the reactor into separate compartments.</p> <p num="p0037"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3a</figref> is a diagram of such a partitioned CSTR reactor <b>10</b> useful in the present invention.

NEODOL 25, a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> blend of C<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>13</sub>, C<sub>14</sub> and C<sub>15</sub> high purity primary alcohols which is commercially available from Shell was used in the Examples.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Examples C1, C2, 3, 4 and 5</u></b></heading><p num="p0041">Example C1 was a product from a commercial process utilizing KOH/NaOH as catalyst. Example C2 was a product from a DMC-catalyzed semi-batch process with a NEODOL 25 starter.</p><p num="p0042">Example 3 was a product from a single stage DMC-catalyzed process with NEODOL 25 starter. A 35-hydroxyl number propoxylate of NEODOL 25 containing 30 ppm of DMC catalyst was charged to a one-gallon CSTR stainless steel reactor equipped with a mechanical agitator and slowly heated. Once the reactor temperature reached 130°C, an initial charge of ethylene oxide was charged to the reactor over several minutes. After 10 minutes, the pressure in the reactor decreased indicating that the DMC catalyst was active. The ethylene oxide feed was restarted and set at a rate of 19.4 g/min (equivalent to a two-hour residence time). After establishing the oxide feed, a feed containing NEODOL 25 and 131 ppm DMC catalyst was started at a rate of 10.2 g/min.</p><p num="p0043">The DMC catalyst was added to the NEODOL 25 as a dry powder and remained dispersed in the NEODOL 25 by constant agitation of the NEODOL 25/ DMC catalyst feed vessel. The DMC concentration in the NEODOL 25 was sufficient to provide 45 ppm in the final product. When the pressure in the reactor reached 50 psia, a valve at the top of the reactor was opened to a back pressure regulator and the contents of the liquid full reactor were allowed to flow out of the reactor. The polyether coming out of the reactor was passed through a steam-heated line before being collected in a heated and stirred jacketed vessel. The ethylene oxide and NEODOL 25 /catalyst feeds continued for approximately 22 hours at which point both the feeds were stopped.

The ethylene oxide feed to the one-gallon reactor was started and set at a rate of 16.7<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> g/min (equivalent to a 1.5 hr residence time in the one gallon reactor).

The ethylene oxide was then started to the two-gallon reactor at a rate of 16.7 g/min, equivalent to a 2.1 hr residence time in the two-gallon reactor. The polyether coming out of the liquid full two-gallon reactor was passed through a second back pressure regulator and onto a steam-heated line before being collected in a heated and stirred jacketed vessel. The ethylene oxide and NEODOL 25 /catalyst feeds continued for approximately 9 hours at which point the feeds to both reactors were stopped.

A short time later, the ethylene oxide feed (17.9 g/min) to the two-gallon reactor was restarted, equivalent to a 2.2 hr residence time in the two-gallon reactor. The polyether was continuously removed from the two-gallon reactor and collected in a manner similar to Example 4. The feeds were continued for 9 hours at which point the feeds to both reactors were stopped.
