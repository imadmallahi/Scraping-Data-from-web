of the metal oxide, to which a noble metal selected from among the group VIII
metals of the periodic table is added as the active component. In addition, the

hydrocarbons contained in hydrocarbon oils, and relates particularly to a
hydrogenation catalyst for aromatic hydrocarbons contained in hydrocarbon oils
which has a low hydrocracking ratio, high resistance to poisoning by sulfur
hydrocarbons and the like, and high hydrogenation activity.</p><heading><u style="single">Background of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0002">The light gas oil used for fuel in diesel engines is prepared as a blend of
mainly a light gas oil obtained by performing hydrodesulfurization and
denitrogentation processing on a straight run light gas oil fraction having a
specific boiling point range obtained by atmospheric distillation of crude oil, and
a light gas oil fraction obtained by vacuum distillation.</p><p num="0003">However, because the volume of the light gas oil fraction in the crude oil is 
limited, and crude oil becomes heavier over time, the straight run light gas oil
fraction obtained by atmospheric distillation tends to reduce in volume.
Furthermore, because the demand for light gas oil is increasing in accordance
with an increase in the production of diesel engines, a shortage in the supply of
light gas oil is anticipated in the near future.</p><p num="0004">As a result, measures such as adding a cracked or hydrogenated and
desulfurized heavy gas oil to the light gas oil fraction, or increasing the
production of blend oils which can be added to straight run light gas oil fractions
are being considered.</p><p num="0005">In the case of blend oils which can be added to a straight run light gas oil
fraction, light cycle oil having a specific boiling point range obtained from a
fluid catalytic cracker is drawing considerable attention as a new blend oil for
light gas oil.</p><p num="0006">However, because the light cycle oil contains a large amount of aromatic
hydrocarbons, adding the light cycle oil with these characteristics directly to the
straight run light gas oil fraction causes the cetane index of the thus obtained
light gas oil to be lowered substantially.</p><p num="0007">Furthermore, in terms of the standards for aromatic hydrocarbon content
within light gas oil fuel, it is anticipated that, in the future, a further reduction of 
the amount of aromatic hydrocarbons included in light cycle oil to below current
levels will be required by law. This is because air pollutants such as particulates
in the exhaust gas of diesel engines which contains aromatic hydrocarbons, and
specifically the particulate matter which occurs due to the incomplete
combustion of a portion of the aromatic hydrocarbons, cause environmental
problems. Strict regulations are already in place in Sweden and in California,
USA regarding the content of aromatic hydrocarbons in light gas oil.</p><p num="0008">In order to use the light cycle oil as a blend oil, it is desirable that the
aromatic hydrocarbon content be reduced by performing catalytic hydrogenation
on the light cycle oil. The sulfur compound content of light cycle oil is low
compared with straight run light gas oil fractions, but the hydrogen sulfide
produced during hydrogenation of the sulfur compound in there oils may cause a
deterioration in activity by inhibiting the hydrogenation of the aromatic
hydrocarbons and poisoning active sites of the hydroprocessing catalyst.
Consequently, a hydrogenation catalyst for light cycle oil must have high
hydrogenation activity and sulfur resistance with respect to aromatic
hydrocarbons, and also have desulfurization capabilities.</p><p num="0009">Among hydrogenation catalysts, catalysts wherein a Group VIII metal is
supported by a carrier such as alumina generally have high hydrogenation 
activity and are effective catalysts, but they suffer in that they deactivate early by
being poisoned by the sulfur compounds and the like in the hydrocarbon oils. In
order to overcome this problem, an attempt to perform hydrogenation using a
catalyst containing zeolite in the carrier is described in Japanese Patent
Publication No. Toku Kai Sho 64-66292, and Japanese Patent Publication No.
Toku Hyo Hei 8-509999. However, although zeolite is a catalyst with high
hydrocracking activity, in hydroprocessing, a hydrocracking occurs at the same
time. Because the liquid yield of the light gas oil fraction decreases if a
hydrocracking occurs during the hydroprocessing of light cycle oil, it is
necessary to suppress hydrocracking activity as much as possible. In addition,
the catalyst is poisoned by the high concentration of sulfur compounds and the
like contained in the crude oil, and the hydrogenation activity with respect to the
aromatic hydrocarbons remains unsatisfactory.</p><p num="0010">Furthermore, an attempt to perform hydroprocessing using a catalyst
comprising a crystalline clay mineral having silicon and magnesium as its main
components is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Toku Kai Hei 8-283746.
However, while this method did have the effect of suppressing
hydrocracking and raising the yield of the oil product, the hydrogenation activity 
with respect to the aromatic hydrocarbons remains unsatisfactory.</p><p num="0011">Generally, catalysts are formed with either comparatively large pores of
greater than several dozen nm, or conversely with small pores of less than several
dozen nm, and/or with a combination of comparatively large pores of greater
than several dozen nm and small pores of less than several dozen nm. The
balance of these pore capacities has a large influence on the targeted
hydrogenation activity.</p><p num="0012">The pore characteristics are measured using a mercury porosimetry method
for sizes ranging from 4 to 46800 nm, a nitrogen adsorption-DH method for sizes
ranging from 2 to 200 nm, and a nitrogen adsorption-t-plot method for sizes
ranging from 0.7 to 2 nm. The nitrogen adsorption-DH method and the nitrogen
adsorption-t-plot-method are analysis methods based on adsorption isotherms
obtained by nitrogen adsorption measurements, and the term "measurement" in
the present specification includes obtaining physical properties by means of this
type of analysis.</p><p num="0013">The pore characteristics of the catalyst, for example, the total volume of
pores sized from 0.7 to 2 nm contained in 1g of catalyst is referred to as "the 0.7
to 2 nm pore volume" and is expressed in units of ml/g. </p><heading><u style="single">Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0014">An object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst which resolves the
problems described above associated with conventional catalysts, which is
suitable for hydrogenation of hydrocarbon oils containing sulfur compounds and
the like, and particularly light gas oil fractions, to reduce the aromatic
hydrocarbon content, and which has high resistance to sulfur compounds, high
hydrogenation activity, and moreover produces an oil product with a high liquid
yield.</p><heading><u style="single">Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments</u></heading><p num="0015">A hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention is a hydrogenation
catalyst for hydrocarbon oils containing aromatic hydrocarbons, wherein the
catalyst comprises a carrier and an active metal, and the pore characteristics of
the catalyst are such that the volume of pores with a pore size of at least 4 nm as
measured by a mercury porosimetry method is within a range from 0.3 to 0.6
ml/g, the volume of pores with a pore size of at least 200 nm is no more than 0.05
ml/g, the volume of pores with a pore size from 0.7 to 2 nm as measured by a
nitrogen adsorption-t-plot method is within a range from 0.2 to 0.3 ml/g, and the
volume of pores with a pore size from 2 to 4 nm as measured by a nitrogen 
adsorption-DH method is within a range from 0.15 to 0.2 ml/g.</p><p num="0016">Preferably the hydrocarbon oil contains 80 weight percent or more of a
fraction with a boiling point of 170 to 390°C.</p><p num="0017">Preferably the hydrogenation catalyst for hydrocarbon oils containing
aromatic hydrocarbons comprises a carrier and an active metal, wherein the
carrier is composed of silica-magnesia, the active metal is a noble metal selected
from the group VIII of the periodic table, and the magnesia content of the silica-magnesia
is within a range from 25 to 50 weight percent, calculated in terms of
the metal oxide.</p><p num="0018">Preferably the proportion of the noble metal selected from the group VIII of
the periodic table is within a range from 0.1 to 2 weight percent, calculated in
terms of the metal.</p><p num="0019">In the hydrogenation catalyst for hydrocarbon oils containing aromatic
hydrocarbons, preferably the catalyst comprises a carrier and an active metal, and
the effective pore size distribution of the catalyst is composed of pore sizes
within a range from 4 to 200 nm, and pore sizes within a range from 0.7 to 4 nm,
wherein the volume of pores with a pore size in the range from 4 to 200 nm is 0.3
to 0.6 ml/g, and the volume of pores with a pore size in the range from 0.7 to 4
nm is 0.35 to 0.5 ml/g. </p><p num="0020">The inventors of the present invention, as a result of investigating inorganic
oxides which form the substrate of a catalyst, discovered a silica-magnesia
composition for use as a carrier material, and investigated the performance of a
catalyst formed by the conventional process of supporting a noble metal from the
group VIII of the periodic table by this silica-magnesia composition. In addition,
the inventors discovered that in terms of the composition ratio of the silica-magnesia
compound, a preferred specific range exists which is suitable for
lowering the amount of aromatic hydrocarbons in the light gas oil fraction by
hydrogenation and is satisfactorily resistant to sulfur hydrocarbons and the like,
and also discovered that a suitable range exists with regard to the amount of
active metal, and proposed these findings in Japanese Patent Application No.
Toku Gan Hei 10-356347. In addition, the inventors of the present invention
developed the present invention as a result of conducting intensive research into
lowering the amount of aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, the silica-magnesia
composition utilizes an amorphous material,</p><p num="0021">In other words, the present invention provides a hydrogenation catalyst for
the aromatic hydrocarbons included in hydrocarbon oils. The catalyst has a
silica-magnesia composition as the carrier, and comprises a silica-magnesia oxide 
carrier with a magnesia content within a range from 25 to 50 weight percent
calculated in terms of the metal oxide, to which a noble metal selected from
among the group VIII metals of the periodic table has been added as the active
component. In addition, the pore characteristics of the catalyst are such that the
volume of pores with a pore size of at least 4 nm as measured by a mercury
porosimetry method is within the range from 0.3 to 0.6 ml/g, the volume of pores
with a pore size of at least 200 nm is no more than 0.05 ml/g, the volume of pores
with a pore size from 0.7 to 2 nm as measured by nitrogen adsorption-t-plot
method is within the range from 0.2 to 0.3 ml/g, and the volume of pores with a
pore size from 2 to 4 nm as measured by nitrogen adsorption-DH method is
within the range from 0.15 to 0.2 ml/g.</p><p num="0022">It is preferable that the hydrocarbon oil contains a fraction with a boiling
point of 170 to 390°C by an amount of 80 weight percent or more.</p><p num="0023">It is preferable that the hydrogenation catalyst for hydrocarbon oils
containing aromatic hydrocarbons comprises a carrier and an active metal,
wherein the carrier is formed from silica-magnesia, the active metal is a noble
metal selected from the group VIII of the periodic table, and the magnesia
content of the silica-magnesia is within a range from 25 to 50 weight percent,
calculated in terms of the metal oxide. Moreover, the silica-magnesia oxide 
carrier is produced using a silica-magnesia hydrate gel as a basic raw material.</p><p num="0024">It is preferable that the proportion of the noble metal selected from the
group VIII of the periodic table is within a range from 0.1 to 2 weight percent,
calculated in terms of the metal.</p><p num="0025">A catalyst of the present invention is prepared by adding a salt solution of
the noble metal selected from the group VIII of the periodic table to the carrier
comprising a silica-magnesia hydrate gel and/or silica-magnesia oxide carrier,
using either a co-mixing method or an impregnation method, and then following
drying, performing a calcination. The silica-magnesia hydrate gel becomes
silica-magnesia oxide carrier through the calcination.</p><p num="0026">Specifically, the salt solution of the noble metal selected from the group
VIII of the periodic table is added to the silica-magnesia hydrate gel which has a
magnesia content, calculated in terms of the metal oxide, of between 25 and 50
weight percent, and the mixture is then kneaded and extruded, and after drying, is
calcined (co-mixing method). Alternatively, a silica-magnesia oxide carrier
obtained by kneading and extruding the silica-magnesia hydrate gel with a
magnesia content, calculated in terms of the metal oxide, of between 25 and 50
weight percent, drying and subsequent calcination is impregnated with a salt
solution of the noble metal selected from the group VIII of the periodic table, and 
then after drying, is subjected to calcination (impregnation method).</p><p num="0027">Common hydrolysis methods for manufacturing the silica-magnesia hydrate
gel with a magnesia content, calculated in terms of the metal oxide, of between
25 and 50 weight percent include a coprecipitation method, a deposition method,
and a sol-gel process, although the coprecipitation method is preferred. For
example, hydrolysis is performed using a method wherein a sodium silicate
aqueous solution, and a magnesium chloride aqueous solution with an amount of
magnesium, calculated in terms of the oxide MgO, within a range from 25 to 50
weight percent, are added dropwise concurrently or approximately concurrently
into a reaction vessel at a hydrolysis temperature within a range from 40°C to
60°C, and the thus produced silica-magnesia hydrate slurry is then filtered,
washed, and filtered again to obtain a silica-magnesia hydrate gel.</p><p num="0028">In the present invention, the reason the magnesia content in the silica-magnesia
oxide carrier, calculated in terms of the metal oxide, is limited to a
value within the range from 25 to 50 weight percent is that outside this range, the
hydrogenation catalyst does not function sufficiently well to fulfill the object of
the present invention, because the amount of solid acid in the silica-magnesia
reduces and/or the amount of solid base increases. </p><p num="0029">Furthermore, the reason the reaction temperature during hydrolysis is set to
a value within the range from 40°C to 60°C is that outside this temperature
range, the requirements for the pore characteristics for the hydrogenation catalyst
of the present invention cannot be satisfied.</p><p num="0030">Examples of the silica raw material which can be used in the manufacture of
the aforementioned silica-magnesia hydrate gel include water soluble salts such
as a No. 1 sodium silicate solution, a No. 2 sodium silicate solution and a No. 3
sodium silicate solution. Furthermore, water soluble salts such as magnesium
chloride, magnesium sulfate, magnesium nitrate and magnesium acetate can be
used as the magnesia raw material.</p><p num="0031">Next, a plastic substance obtained by adding the salt solution of the noble
metal selected from the group VIII of the periodic table to the silica-magnesia
hydrate gel so that the metal component, calculated in terms of the metal, is from
0.1 to 2 weight percent and subsequent kneading, or a plastic substance obtained
by kneading the aforementioned silica-magnesia hydrate gel, is extruded into the
desired shape, and after drying, is calcined.</p><p num="0032">The shape of the extruded product may be any desired shape such as
cylindrical, two leaf, four leaf, or spherical. </p><p num="0033">Provided the extruded object is dried evenly, drying should not present any
particular problems, and for reasons of efficiency and simplicity, the extruded
object should be dried at a temperature within a range from 80°C to 120°C.
Furthermore during calcination, because changes may occur such as an
agglomeration or a phase change of the active component, the calcination
temperature should normally be between 350°C and 600°C, and preferably
between 400°C and 500°C. If the calcination temperature is below 350°C an
oxide state is not attained, and if the calcination temperature exceeds 600°C, the
specific surface area decreases markedly.</p><p num="0034">In the present invention, the active component or the active metal is selected
from metals such as ruthenium, rhodium, palladium or platinum from the group
VIII of the periodic table, and a combination of palladium and platinum is
especially favorable.</p><p num="0035">The reason the amount of the active component added, or the amount of the
active metal supported is within the range, calculated in terms of the metal, from
0.1 to 2 weight percent relative to the weight of the catalyst is because an amount
of less than 0.1 weight percent is too low for the effects caused by the active
metal to manifest, whereas an amount exceeding 2 weight percent offers no 
further improvement in catalytic activity.</p><p num="0036">The metal salt of the noble metal used in the present invention may be any
salt provided that it is a water soluble salt, and suitable examples include a
nitrate, a chloride, an acetate or an ammine complex.</p><p num="0037">Examples of support methods include ion exchange methods, impregnation
methods, gas phase methods and co-mixing methods, although the impregnation
method and/or the co-mixing method, which are the most representative
conventional catalyst preparation methods, are the most convenient.
Furthermore, after being supported on the carrier, drying and calcination are then
performed to fix the active metal component to the metal oxide carrier.</p><p num="0038">The pore characteristics of the hydrogenation catalyst obtained in this
manner are preferably such that the volume of pores with a pore size of at least 4
nm as measured by the mercury porosimetry method is within a range from 0.3 to
0.6 ml/g, the volume of pores with a pore size of at least 200 nm is up to 0.05
ml/g, the volume of pores with a pore size from 0.7 to 2 nm as measured by the
nitrogen adsorption-t-plot method is within a range from 0.2 to 0.3 ml/g, and the
volume of pores with a pore size from 2 to 4 nm as measured by the nitrogen
adsorption-DH method is within a range from 0.15 to 0.2 ml/g. The nitrogen
adsorption-t-plot method is suitable for measuring the range between 0.7 to 2 nm. 
Furthermore, the nitrogen adsorption-DH method is capable of measuring pore
sizes from 2 to 200 nm, although in this application this is limited to pore sizes
from 2 to 4 nm. Furthermore, it is preferable that the specific surface area
measured using the nitrogen adsorption-BET method is within a range from 350
to 460 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p><p num="0039">The volume of pores with a pore size of at least 4 nm as measured by the
mercury porosimetry method is kept within the range from 0.3 to 0.6 ml/g,
because at less than 0.3 ml/g, the resistance to diffusion of the hydrocarbon oil
(reaction material) through the pores of the catalyst is large, and it becomes
difficult for the hydrocarbon oil (reaction material) to penetrate to the inside of
the pores, and consequently the dearomatizing rate, the desulfurization rate and
the denitrogentation rate deteriorate. Conversely, it is also preferable not to
exceed 0.6 ml/g, because in addition to the catalyst losing its usefulness as an
industrial catalyst due to a deterioration in the crushing strength of the catalyst,
the stability of the catalytic activity also deteriorates, and the catalyst deactivates
prematurely.</p><p num="0040">Furthermore, the volume of pores with a pore size of at least 200 nm as
measured by the mercury porosimetry method is restricted to no more than 0.05
ml/g because at volumes exceeding 0.05 ml/g, in addition to the catalyst losing 
its usefulness as an industrial catalyst due to a deterioration in the crushing
strength of the catalyst, the stability of the catalytic activity deteriorates, and the
catalyst deactivates prematurely, which is undesirable.</p><p num="0041">In addition, the volume of pores with a pore size in the range from 0.7 to 2
nm as measured by the nitrogen adsorption-t-plot method are kept within the
range from 0.2 to 0.3 ml/g for the following reasons. Namely, if the volume of
pores with a pore size in the range from 0.7 to 2 nm as measured by the nitrogen
adsorption-t-plot method is less than 0.2 ml/g, the supported active metal
agglomerates more easily, the dispersability of the active metal particles
deteriorates, and the dearomatizing rate, the desulfurization rate and the
denitrogentation rate fall. Conversely, if the volume of pores with a pore size
from 0.7 to 2 nm is larger than 0.3 ml/g, a hydrocracking is more likely to occur,
coke deposits form inside the pores, and the catalyst deactivates prematurely.</p><p num="0042">Furthermore, the volume of pores with a pore size in the range from 2 to 4
nm as measured by the nitrogen adsorption-DH method is kept within the range
from 0.15 to 0.2 ml/g in order to achieve a balance between the volume of pores
with a pore size in the range from 0.7 to 2 nm and the volume of pores with a
pore size in the range from 4 to 200 nm which is favorable for hydrogenation 
activity. In other words, it is clear from the volume of pores with a pore size
between 0.7 and 4 nm as measured by the nitrogen adsorption-t-plot method and
the nitrogen adsorption-DH method, and the volumes of pores with a pore size of
at least 4 nm and at least 200 nm as measured by the mercury porosimetry
method, that there is a depression in the pore distribution within the range from 2
to 4 nm.</p><p num="0043">It is preferable that the hydrocarbon oil contains 80 weight percent or more
of a fraction with a boiling point of 170 to 390°C. Light gas oil, kerosene, and
jet fuel are examples of hydrocarbon oils that fall within this range.</p><p num="0044">The crushing strength of an industrial catalyst carrier varies according to the
shape of the catalyst, but generally, a value of at least 1.0 kg/mm is required for a
1.5 mm cylindrical catalyst.</p><p num="0045">The specific surface area as measured by the nitrogen adsorption-BET
method is set within the range from 350 to 460 m<sup>2</sup>/g because if the specific
surface area is either too small or too large, the catalytic hydrogenation does not
proceed efficiently.</p><p num="0046">It is thought that the catalyst of the present invention has high
hydrogenation activity for aromatic hydrocarbons contained in hydrocarbon oils
and yet is highly resistant to poisoning by sulfur hydrocarbons and the like 
because the targeted reaction proceeds very efficiently due to the specific pore
structure and high specific surface area of the catalyst.</p><p num="0047">In the pore characteristics of the present invention, the volume of pores with
a pore size from 0.7 to 2 nm is calculated by the nitrogen adsorption-t-plot
method (Coloid Interface Sci., 21, 405 (1996)), the volume of pores with a pore
size from 2 to 4 nm is calculated by the nitrogen adsorption-DH method (Kelvin
Equation), and the specific surface area is calculated by the nitrogen adsorption-BET
method. In addition, the aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil processed to
evaluate the performance of the catalyst is determined using a High Performance
Liquid Chromatograph (manufactured by Shimazu Corporation), the sulfur
content is determined using a Total Sulfur Analyzer (made by Mitsubishi
Chemical Corporation (Ltd.)), and the nitrogen content is determined using a
Total Nitrogen Analyzer (made by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (Ltd.)).</p><p num="0048">As follows, the present invention is described in greater detail with

the present invention is in no way limited to the examples presented.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 1</u></heading><heading>(1) Hydrolysis and preparation of the catalyst</heading><p num="0049">1 liter of water was placed in a 100 liter capacity stainless steel reaction
