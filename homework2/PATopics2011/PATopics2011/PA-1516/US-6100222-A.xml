Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relates generally to the exploitation of subterranean formations. More specifically, it relates to the exploitation of subterranean petroliferous formations using high density mixed-brine-based fluids such as drilling, drill-in, completion, hydraulic fracturing, work-over, packer, well treating, testing, spacer, or hole abandonment fluids. Yet more specifically, the field of this invention is fluid rheology, thickeners, viscosifiers, viscoelastic fluids, and the physical hydration of polymer additives into high density mixed-brine-based drilling, drill-in, completion, hydraulic fracturing, work-over, packer, well treating, testing, spacer, or hole abandonment fluids.</p><p>2. Discussion of Related Art</p><p>A wide variety of methods for exploiting subterranean petroliferous formations are known in the art, and the problems associated therewith are also well known. Brines are commonly used in drilling, drill-in, work-over, hydraulic fracturing, completion, packer, well treating, testing, spacer, or hole abandonment fluids because of their wide density range and their character of being free of suspended solids and essentially non-damaging to subterranean petroliferous formations. During the process of drilling and completing an oil well, it is often desirable to add polymer and possibly bridging agents, to viscosify the drilling or completion fluid and thereby to control fluid loss to the formation. As fluids are lost into the formation, these materials filter out and build up a filter cake at the rock face which limits further flow of fluids into the formation. Some fluids nevertheless invariably flow into the formation and can interact with formation matrix in such a way as to reduce the permeability of the formation to the subsequent in-flow or out-flow of fluid, especially oil, gas, condensate or other fluid targeted for withdraw and use. This reduction in the rock permeability is termed "formation damage".</p><p>Xanthan gum is commonly used as a viscosifying polymer in brine-based drilling fluids whereas the cheaper hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is commonly used in a work-over fluid. Xanthan gum has superior tolerance to high pH and temperature and has superior thixotropic properties compared to other viscosifying polymers. The viscosifying polymer is usually added to the brine to thicken it so that it will have, for example, high carrying capacity for the cuttings produced while drilling and high viscosity for a work-over fluid to control fluid loss and minimize formation damage. Xanthan gum also has the ability to impart gel character to a brine so that it will have high carrying capacity for drill cuttings even when the drilling process is interrupted and the fluid becomes quiescent.</p><p>HEC is a typical viscosifier and fluid loss control agent which is known to cause relatively little damage to the formation. Guar gum and starch derivatives can also be used. However, HEC and other polymers are very slow to viscosify brines having densities above about 12.0 ppg and HEC does not viscosify formate brines. Heating can be required to reach a desired viscosity for some brines.</p><p>For many applications of brine-based drilling fluids, HEC lacks sufficient thermal stability and carrying capacity for the drill cuttings. In these cases, therefore, xanthan gum is typically used instead. While such agents as HEC and xanthan gum impart both viscosity and fluid loss control to the drilling, drill in, completion, hydraulic fracturing, work over, well treating, spacer, or hole abandonment fluids, starches are often added to augment the fluid loss properties. Standard brine based drilling fluid may also include a bridging agent, such as, for example, sized particles of calcium carbonate or sodium chloride. In addition, a representative brine based drilling fluid can also include, for example, corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, pH control additives, surfactants, solvents, and/or weighting agents.</p><p>Conventional techniques for viscosifying a brine are limited by the fact that so much of the water in the brine is devoted to solubilization of the salt that there is not enough water left over for the solubilization of the viscosifying agent. In effect, the viscosifying agent is "salted out". Additionally, mixed-salt brines are often limited by salt solubilities to relatively low densities. For example, when a dense brine based on NaBr is added to a dense brine based on Ca(NO.sub.3).sub.2, the precipitation of solid NaNO.sub.3 depletes the solution so much that the remaining brine is only of relatively moderate density. As another example, the same sort of interaction and precipitation occurs when a dense brine based on CaCl.sub.2 or CaBr.sub.2 is added to a dense brine based on K.sub.2 CO.sub.3. The present invention teaches a group of mixed salts which are preferred because they can be formulated up to relatively high densities and yet the availability of "free" water is sufficient to allow viscosifying polymers to hydrate acceptably up to relatively high concentrations. Hence, inventive mixed-salt compositions are capable of exhibiting relatively high viscosities.</p><p>Problems occur when attempting to use xanthan gum to viscosify high concentrations of divalent-cation-based brines where most of the water is associated with salt. These problems include the need for extended mixing times, high shear, and/or heat in order to viscosify the brine. Similar problems occur with other viscosifiers. These problems are relatively minor in the brine concentration range extending most of the way from fresh water to almost saturated brine, then suddenly the problems get much more serious when just a relatively small amount of extra salt is added to a near-saturated brine.</p><p>One example is viscosifying xanthan gum in brines having high concentrations of CaBr.sub.2, where most of the water is occupied by the salt. This system requires extended mixing times, high shear, and/or heat in order to viscosity the brine. (See Table 1A).</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 1A__________________________________________________________________________        Base Brine               Steps Neededwt. %  %     Density               to ViscosifyCaBr.sub.2  saturation        (ppg)  the Brine Uniformly @ 1-5 ppb__________________________________________________________________________0 to 47.9  0.0 to 83.5        8.3 to 13.5               Stirring xanthan gum into the brine at room               temperature; no extra shear needed; no extra               heating needed.48.5 to 51.3  84.5 to        13.6 to 14.1               Stirring xanthan gum into the brine at room  89.4         temperature followed by moderate shearing               or mild warming.51.9   90.4  14.2   Stirring xanthan gum into the brine followed               by extensive shearing at room temperature or               mild shearing combined with moderate               heating.52.4 to 57.4  91.3 to        14.3 to 15.35               Stirring xanthan gum into the brine at room  100.0        temperature followed by extensive mixing               and shearing while heating steadily until               polymer hydrates sufficiently.__________________________________________________________________________</pre></p><p>The data clearly show the need for extended mixing times, high shear, and/or heat in order to viscosify CaBr.sub.2 brines above about 85% saturation.</p><p>When 3 pounds per barrel (ppb) of xanthan gum is added to a 14.2 pounds per gallon (ppg) substantially pure CaBr.sub.2 solution, stirred vigorously for an hour at room temperature, 70 on a Silverson mixer Model L4RT at 4000 rpm, it does not viscosity by indication of a yield point (YP) of 0 measured on a variable speed rheometer. It was noticed that by stirring the solution energetically for one hour at 125 a viscosity at the 3 rpm reading of 2700 cp as shown in Table 1B.

The solutions were slowly heated to 150 remain at that temperature until maximum viscosity was achieved. Two separate tests were performed at shear rates of 511 sec.sup.-1 (300 rpm) and 170 sec.sup.-1 (100 rpm). The temperatures at which 25% of maximum viscosity was obtained were found to be 122 respectively. FIG. 1 illustrates these results and shows that 2.5 additional hours are needed to viscosify the solution at 170 sec.sup.-1 (100 rpm) than at 511 sec.sup.-1 (300 rpm).

A transition temperature is the temperature at which the polymer undergoes an order-disorder conformation change. This conformation change is accompanied by a massive loss of viscosity and increase in the rate of hydrolytic degradation by two orders of magnitude. It has also been shown that CaBr.sub.2 solutions above 10.4 ppg have a T.sub.m of less than 80 been used as a guide for predicting thermal stability of the polymers in brine solutions.</p><p>A variety of well servicing fluids and associated systems have been proposed in the prior art. There has remained a need for improved systems having advantageous characteristics for viscosification and fluid loss control, dispersability and hydration. Accordingly, the present invention is directed toward enhancing the thermal stability, viscosity and gel structure of dense brine-based drilling, drill-in, completion, hydraulic fracturing, work-over, packer, well treating, testing, spacer, or hole abandonment fluids and toward increasing the thermal stability of the water-soluble or water-dispersable polymer used to viscosity and gel the brines.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>According to the present invention, there are provided mixed salt compositions that are viscosified easily and have superior stability compared to a corresponding single salt composition having a similar density. For example, the present inventors have discovered that a 14.2 ppg CaBr.sub.2 and CaCl.sub.2 mixture is extremely difficult or impossible to fully viscosify with xanthan gum or other viscosifiers without introducing significant heat and shear; however, if a 13.6 ppg CaBr.sub.2 solution is weighted with dry NaBr to 14.2 ppg it is relatively easier to viscosity without the introduction of significant shear or heat. The present inventors have also discovered, for example, that the stability of biopolymers in a calcium-based brine is dramatically improved when the formulation of the base brine is optimized with respect to the calcium chloride and calcium bromide content.</p><p>According to the present invention there are provided high-density, viscosified, aqueous compositions having superior stability under stress factors such as aging, heat, mechanical agitation and shear.

Preferably, the aqueous solution is prepared by dissolving into water at least two salts, as described herein, to provide a salt solution having a density of greater than about 9.5 pounds per gallon (ppg). Additionally provided are methods for using inventive high-density, viscosified, aqueous compositions including using the compositions as drilling, drill-in, completion, hydraulic fracturing, work-over, packer, well treating, testing, spacer, or hole abandonment fluids.</p><p>It is an object of the present invention to provide mixed salt systems that are viscosified easily compared to a single salt system having similar density.</p><p>Additionally, it is an object of the present invention to provide a viscosified mixed salt system that displays greater stability under such stressing factors as aging, heat, mechanical agitation, and shear, compared to the single salt system of similar density.</p><p>Another object of the present invention is to provide high density mixed-salt brines having more stable rheological properties, especially at elevated temperatures and over extended periods of time, and which rheological properties are more resistant to heat- and shear-degradation.</p><p>It is also an object of the invention to provide viscosified high density mixed-salt brines having low crystallization temperatures and broad ranging compatibility with, for example, fluid-loss agents, sea water, formation water and spacers.</p><p>Additional objects, features and advantages will be apparent from the following description.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 is a plot of viscosity and temperature versus time and displays the temperature at a specific shear needed to viscosify 14.2 ppg CaBr.sub.2 solutions.</p><p>FIG. 2 is a plot of percent viscosity versus temperature for two single salt systems and one mixed salt system.</p><p>FIG. 3 is a plot of T.sub.50 ( 10.5 ppg CaCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2 solution.</p><p>FIG. 4 is a plot of percent viscosity versus temperature, showing viscosity data and the T.sub.m for 12.5 ppg NaBr and mixtures of 13.0 ppg CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr and showing viscosity data for pure CaBr.sub.2.</p><p>FIG. 5 is a plot of T.sub.50 ( for a 13 ppg CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr solution.</p><p>FIG. 6 is a plot of percent viscosity versus temperature for a test of thermal stability of pre-gelatinized starch as described more fully in Example 5.</p><p>FIG. 7 is a plot of T.sub.50 ( for a 12.5 ppg NaBr/LiBr solution.</p><p>FIG. 8 is a plot of T.sub.50 ( for a 13 ppg CaBr.sub.2 /LiBr solution.</p><p>FIG. 9 is a plot of T.sub.m ( NaNO.sub.3 brine in 11.0 ppg NaHCO.sub.2 /NaNO.sub.3 brine mixtures.</p><p>FIG. 10 is a plot of Yield Point (YP) versus pounds MgCl.sub.2 in a 10.5 ppg CaCl.sub.2 /MgCl.sub.2 solution.</p><p>FIG. 11 is a plot of pH versus the log of the molar ratio of total halides to zinc, and is described in greater detail in Example 16.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to preferred embodiments thereof and specific language will be used to describe the same.

It should be noted that in inventive compositions, the salts are substantially dissolved into water. As such, a statement that a particular inventive composition includes two salts is intended to mean that the composition includes the cations and anions of the salt, although these cations and anions may be, for example, in the ionic state or complexed with other ions or materials.</p><p>It is also contemplated by the present invention that preferred compositions may be prepared using as starting materials three or more different salts. In this regard, in one preferred aspect, inventive compositions comprise three different cations, a first cation having a +2 charge, a second cation having a +2 charge, or a second cation in which the cation is held as a complex having cationic, neutral, or anionic form, and a third cation having a +1 charge.</p><p>Another starting material for the practice of the invention is a water-soluble or water-dispersable polymer. Preferably the polymer used in accordance with the present invention is a biopolymer, and is more preferably selected from the group consisting of algin; anionic cellulose; anionic polysaccharide; cationic polysaccharide; carboxymethyl cellulose; carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose; gellan gum; guar gum; gum ghatti; gum karaya; gum tragacanth; gum arabic; gum acacia; locust bean gum; methacrylic acid polymer; polyamine; polyanionic cellulose; iota, lambda or kappa sulfated polysaccharides; polysaccharides modified by i) cross-linking, ii) hydroxyethylation, iii) hydroxypropylation, iv) carboxymethyl-hydroxyethylation, v) carboxymethylhydroxypropylation, vi)carboxymethylation, or vii) carboxylation; rhamsan gum; vinyl compound polymer; wellan gum or glycol-compatible wellan gum; xanthan or xanthan gum; or mixtures of said polymers.

It is readily understood that additional polymers having thixotropic properties or gel structure properties similar to those specifically mentioned may also be advantageously used in accordance with the present invention. Polymers useful according to the present invention are readily available commercially.</p><p>Inventive compositions are, generally, dense salt solutions viscosified with a polymer. Inventive compositions comprise water; a water-soluble or water-dispersable polymer; one or more cation selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, or mixtures thereof; and one or more anion selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide, iodide, formate, nitrate, acetate, cyanate, thiocyanate, a zinc complex anion or mixtures thereof; wherein there are present either at least two cations or at least two anions in effective amounts to impart to the composition advantageous stability under stressing factors such as heat, shear and pH.</p><p>Inventive compositions are preferably prepared from the following starting materials in the proportions given: from about 10.0 to about 90.0 weight percent water; from about 0.01 to about 45.0 weight percent polymer; from about 0.05 to about 85.0 weight percent of a first salt; and from about 0.05 to about 85.0 weight percent of a second salt. In an alternate preferred embodiment, also added is from about 0.05 to about 85.0 weight percent of a third salt. More preferably, inventive compositions are prepared using the following proportions of starting materials: from about 0.5 to about 10 weight percent polymer; from about 2 to about 80 weight percent of a first salt; and from about 2 to about 40 weight percent of a second salt and optionally from about 2 to about 80 percent of a third salt. Additionally, the relative amounts of each salt may advantageously be optimized with minimal experimentation to accomplish the desired results described herein.</p><p>It is readily understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that additional materials may also be included in preferred compositions. Examples of such additives include starch, bridging agents (such as, for example, sized particles of calcium carbonate or sodium chloride), corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, pH control additives, surfactants and/or weighting agents.</p><p>In another aspect of the invention, high-density, viscous compositions are made by first providing an aqueous solution having dissolved therein at least one cation selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, or mixtures thereof, and at least one anion selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide, iodide, formate, nitrate, acetate, cyanate, thiocyanate, a zinc complex anion, or mixtures thereof, wherein there is present either at least two cations or at least two anions in amounts effective to achieve the desired stability; and then mixing a water-soluble or water-dispersable polymer into the brine. The aqueous solution may be provided, for example, by dissolving into water a first salt and a second salt, each comprising a cation selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, or mixtures thereof; and an anion selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide, iodide, formate, nitrate, acetate, cyanate, thiocyanate, a zinc complex anion, or mixtures thereof. Preferably the resulting salt solution has a density of greater than about 9.5 pounds per gallon (ppg), more preferably greater than about 10 ppg, and yet more preferably greater than about 11.5 ppg.</p><p>Alternatively, the polymer is added to a brine, having dissolved therein one salt, before adding the second salt either in the form of a brine or a solid salt. The resulting composition in either instance preferably includes at least about 0.1 pounds per barrel (ppb) of the polymer, at least about 1% cations by weight, and at least about 1% anions by weight; more preferably at least about 0.2 ppb polymer, at least about 5% cations by weight, and at least about 5% anions by weight; and most preferably at least about 0.4 ppb polymer, at least about 10% cations by weight, and at least about 10% anions by weight.</p><p>Depending upon the specific salt composition of a given system, the addition of the polymer may be facilitated by heating the mixture while stirring. An advantageous feature of the invention, however, is the relative ease with which polymers may be hydrated by relatively dense salt solutions. This feature is described in greater detail below in the Examples with regard to various selected inventive compositions. In one preferred aspect of the invention, the polymer is mixed into the brine by first hydrating, solvating or swelling the polymer at least partially in a fluid medium, and then mixing the fluid medium with the brine.</p><p>Compositions of the present invention exhibit superior stability under such stressing factors as aging, heat, mechanical agitation and shear, this feature being very important in fluids utilized in the field of subterranean drilling. The term "stability" as used herein is intended to refer to the ability of an inventive composition to withstand various stress conditions before the viscosifying polymer's capability to viscosifying the fluid composition is substantially diminished. By "substantially diminished" it is meant diminished to an extent where the composition may no longer be advantageously used for its intended purpose. Diminished viscosity is commonly referred to in the relevant trade as fluid degradation.</p><p>A technique used to measure relative heat stability involves a determination of τ.sub.50 of a mixed salt/polymer composition. To determine τ.sub.50 of an inventive composition, T.sub.50 of a mixed salt composition is determined and related to the T.sub.50 of one or more of the related single salt systems according to the following equation: ##EQU1## wherein (A/B) indicates that the preceding value is a property of the two salt system; (A) represents a corresponding single salt system; and (B) represents the other corresponding single salt system. The term "corresponding single salt system" as used herein is intended to designate a composition consisting essentially of only cations and anions derived from one salt, this salt being one of the salts dissolved in the preparation of the particular inventive two or three salt composition. T.sub.50 of a composition is determined by heating the composition at a given rate and recording the temperature at which the viscosity of the composition is half of its viscosity at room temperature. In one aspect of the invention, inventive two salt systems exhibit a τ.sub.50 of greater than about 1. This means that the T.sub.50 of the inventive two salt system is greater than expected based upon the linear relationship between T.sub.50 values for the two corresponding single salt systems. As such, there are two corresponding single salt systems for each inventive two salt system.

The term "shear" is intended to refer to the ratio between a stress (force per unit area) applied laterally to a material and the strain resulting from this force. Determination of this ratio is one method of measuring the viscosity of a liquid or semisolid. One manner of measuring shear stability involves a determination of ζ.sub.50. To determine ζ.sub.50 of an inventive composition, ξ.sub.50 of a mixed salt composition is determined and related to the ξ.sub.50 of one or more of the related single salt systems according to the following equation: ##EQU2## ξ.sub.50 represents the time, in an experiment conducted at no greater than T.sub.50, at which sustained shear degradation at a shear stress rate of at least 1021 sec.sup.-1 causes the mixture viscosity to drop to 50% of its initial value at that same temperature (T.sub.50). The viscosity is measured at both initial and final conditions at a shear stress rate of 170 sec.sup.-1. In one aspect of the invention, inventive two salt systems exhibit a ζ.sub.50 of greater than about 1. This means that the ξ.sub.50 of the inventive two salt system is greater than expected based upon the linear relationship between the ξ.sub.50 values for the two corresponding single salt systems. As before, there are two corresponding single salt systems for each inventive two salt system.</p><p>Another manner of measuring shear stability involves a determination of ω.sub.50. To determine ω.sub.50 of an inventive composition, σ.sub.50 of a mixed salt composition is determined and related to the σ.sub.50 of one or more of the related single salt systems according to the following equation: ##EQU3## σ.sub.50 represents the shear rate, in an experiment conducted at a temperature no greater than T.sub.50, at which sustained shear degradation for at least 30 minutes causes the mixture viscosity to drop to 50% of its initial value at that same temperature (T.sub.50). The viscosity is measured at both initial and final conditions at a shear stress rate of 170 sec.sup.-1. In one aspect of the invention, inventive two salt systems exhibit a ω.sub.50 of greater than about 1. This means that the σ.sub.50 of the inventive two salt system is greater than expected based upon the linear relationship between the σ.sub.50 values for the two corresponding single salt systems.</p><p>Another important feature of fluids utilized in the subterranean drilling industry is fluid loss control. The term "fluid loss" is intended to refer to the leak-off of fluid into the rock matrix. One manner of measuring fluid loss control involves a determination of ψ.sub.50. To determine ψ.sub.50 of an inventive composition, ρ.sub.50 of a mixed salt composition is determined and related to the ρ.sub.50 of one or more of the related single salt systems according to the following equation: ##EQU4## ρ.sub.50 represents the ratio of the API standard fluid loss volume, in an experiment conducted at a temperature no greater than T.sub.50 after 16 hours of rolling heat aging at a temperature no greater than T.sub.50. In one aspect of the invention, inventive two salt systems exhibit a ψ.sub.50 of less than about 1. This means that the ρ.sub.50 of the inventive two salt system is less than expected based upon the linear relationship between the ρ.sub.50 values for the two corresponding single salt systems. As before, there are two corresponding single salt systems for each inventive two salt system.</p><p>Another important feature of fluids utilized in the subterranean drilling industry is pH stability. It is widely known to those skilled in the art that such processes as acid- or base- catalyzed hydrolytic degradation can lead to loss of viscosifying capability on the part of the polymer. Accordingly, the process of formulating a viscosified fluid involves searching for a pH range wherein these chemical degradation processes are held to acceptable rates and then maintaining the fluid pH within that range throughout subsequent use of the viscosified fluid. The term "pH stability" is intended to refer to the resistance of the fluid to change in pH over time. One manner of measuring pH stability involves a determination of Φ. To determine Φ of an inventive composition, φ of a mixed salt composition is determined and related to the φ of one or more of the related single salt systems according to the following equation: ##EQU5## φ represents a ratio of viscosities and pH changes determined as follows: The fluid is formulated and its initial properties, pH and viscosity at 170 sec.sup.-1, are measured. Then the fluid is subjected to 16 hours of rolling heat aging at a temperature no greater than T.sub.50 ; and the final properties, including pH and viscosity at 170 sec.sup.-1, are measured. The parameter φ is then determined from the following equation: ##EQU6## The φ values for the single salt and multiple salt systems are measured similarly and used to measure Φ according to the above equation. In one aspect of the invention, inventive two salt systems exhibit a Φ of greater than about 1. This means that the φ.sub.50 of the inventive two salt system is greater than expected based upon the linear relationship between the φ values for the two corresponding single salt systems.</p><p>In use, inventive compositions are preferably utilized in exploiting subterranean petroliferous formations as drilling, drill-in, completion, hydraulic fracturing, work-over, packer, well treating, testing, spacer or hole abandonment fluids. For instance, in a preferred use as a hydraulic fracturing fluid, a viscosified mixed salt brine fluid is introduced into a formation at a rate and pressure sufficient to fracture the formation. At first, the fluid leaks off into the rock matrix, building up a filter cake on the rock face. The filter cake then prevents fluid injected thereafter from leaking off significantly. The full force of the applied hydraulic pressure eventually comes to bear upon the rock face, causing the rock to part at the weakest point. As the fracture grows, additional fracturing fluid containing a solid proppant material is introduced. Following this treatment, as much as possible of the introduced fluid is recovered from the formation, but the proppant remains to prevent the complete closure of the fracture. The propped fracture creates a highly conductive channel extending from the well bore into the formation, making the reservoir more productive.</p><p>High viscosity fracturing fluids undergo high shear stress during the introduction of such fluids into a formation. The viscosity of the fluid must be high enough to carry proppant but low enough that excessive friction losses and high well head pumping pressures are not encountered. Polymer degradation is a natural result of shear stresses imposed by pumping, the presence of abrasive materials, and high flow rates through small flow channels. This mechanical degradation accompanies thermal degradation and chemical degradation produced by acid catalyzed hydrolysis of the acetal bonds which are the weakest links along the polymer backbone.</p><p>The invention will be further described with reference to the following specific Examples. It will be understood that these Examples are illustrative and not restrictive in nature.</p><heading>EXAMPLE ONE</heading><heading>PREPARING INVENTIVE DENSE, VISCOSIFIED AQUEOUS COMPOSITIONS</heading><p>Two salts are selected and prepared by dissolving the salts into water.

Amounts of each salt in relation to one another are determined such that the resulting viscosified fluid has a τ.sub.50 of at least about 1; a ζ.sub.50 of at least about 1; a ω.sub.50 of at least about 1; a ψ.sub.50 of at most about 1; or a Φ of at least about 1.

After hydration of the polymer, the second salt in the two salt composition is added either in the form of a dry salt or in a salt solution.</p><heading>EXAMPLE THREE</heading><heading>TESTING PROPERTIES OF INVENTIVE DENSE, VISCOSIFIED AQUEOUS COMPOSITIONS</heading><p>Viscosity Measurements</p><p>A fluid is prepared as in Example 1 or Example 2 and Theological properties are measured and recorded at 120 such as the Fann 35 at the following rpms: 600, 300, 200, 100, 6 and 3. Also measured and recorded are the pH of the fluid at 120 the 10 second and 10 minute gels.</p><p>Determining Heat Stability</p><p>One "barrel equivalent" (BEQ) of the fluid is hot rolled at a predetermined temperature for 16 hours; and one BEQ of the fluid is hot rolled at the predetermined temperature for 72 hours (or 48/96 hours if time is available for longer testing). A normal 42 gallon barrel has a weight in pounds equal to (42 in pounds per gallon. The BEQ is obtained by simply replacing the weight of the barrel in pounds by the weight of the barrel equivalent in grams. This replacement scales the convenient field unit, the barrel, into a workable laboratory size unit, BEQ. After the rheological properties are recorded from the Fann 35 or equivalent for the 16/72 hour or 48/96 hour samples, as indicated above, the samples are examined for evidence of sag, break, or settling and the visual observations are logged. The gels of hot rolled samples of inventive compositions are preferably within the range of from about 6 to about 19.</p><p>Fluid Loss Testing</p><p>The fluid loss properties of the fluid are determined as follows. A fluid loss test of duration ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours is performed in the API standard high pressure high temperature (HP-HT) apparatus. If additional time for testing is available, a 48 hour test duration may be preferable. The testing temperature is predetermined, such as, for example, in accordance with the bottom-hole temperature at which the fluid will be used in the field. The HP-HT apparatus is employed using 250 to 600 psig differential pressure, using, for example, a 50-2000 millidarcy Aloxite disc of diameter of 2.50 inches and thickness of 0.25 inches.</p><p>The cell in the heating jacket and the fluid in the static oven are preheated until the cell and sample reach the test temperature. While the cell is being heated, the disc is covered with a thin layer of de-ionized water. The cover (lid) for the cell should also be put in place to prevent evaporation.</p><p>The fluid being tested is preheated and then poured into the preheated cell. The loaded cell is then prepared for the application of pressure. The cell is pressurized and the temperature adjusted to the target temperature. The discharge valve is then opened, and the filtrate volume is recorded at time intervals such as 1, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 4, 16, 24, and/or 48 hours. The fluid loss volume may then be plotted versus (time).sup.1/2. This plot is, in most cases, substantially linear. If the plot is linear, the fluid loss behavior is considered normal. Whether or not this is the case is noted in the laboratory notebook.</p><p>At 24 or 48 hours, the test is stopped and the cell is cooled and depressurized. It is then noted whether any sag, settling or break has occurred in the fluid in the cell during the pressurized phase of testing. The fluid is then decanted and the filter cake thickness is measured.</p><heading>EXAMPLE FOUR</heading><heading>CaCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2</heading><p>The present inventors have discovered that the stability of biopolymers in a calcium-based brine is dramatically improved when the formation of the base brine is optimized with respect to the calcium chloride and calcium bromide content. At equivalent densities, brine fluids containing calcium chloride and calcium bromide exhibit more stable rheological and gel structure properties with biopolymers than do the corresponding pure calcium chloride brines or pure calcium bromide brines. When the pH of the viscosified fluid is buffered with magnesium oxide in the traditional manner, the rheology of calcium chloride/calcium bromide brines is considerably more stable than the equivalent pure calcium chloride system. For brine densities up to 13.0 ppg or more, the stability of calcium chloride/calcium bromide systems is greater than for the corresponding pure calcium bromide systems.</p><p>Rheological and gel structure data for 9.0 pounds per gallon (ppg), 10.5 ppg and 13.0 ppg calcium-based brines are reported in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. For each brine, the concentration of calcium chloride and calcium bromide are reported as a percent of the total brine salt present (%TS), which is varied from 100% calcium chloride to 100% calcium bromide for the 9.0 and 10.5 ppg brines and from 45% calcium chloride for the 13 ppg fluid. The enhanced thermal stability, rheology and gel structure properties for the calcium chloride/calcium bromide brines are clearly depicted when compared with the corresponding pure salt brines--a result which is totally unexpected based on conventional wisdom in the relevant field.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 2______________________________________9.0 ppg Viscosified Brine2 ppg Bio-Polymer &amp; 2 ppb MgOHeat Aged 16 &amp; 72 Hours @ 180CaCl.sub.2, % TS    100       60        31      0CaBr.sub.2, % TS    0         40        69      100______________________________________Aging Hours    16     72     16   72   16   72   16   72PV/YP    5/19   5/15   5/15 5/15 5/21 5/17 6/17 5/16Gels     7/9    4/4    3/3  4/4  10/13                                 8/11 9/13 6/7pH       8.8    8.9    8.7  8.8  9.0  8.5  9.0  8.6Settling No     No     No   No   No   No   No   No______________________________________ % TS  Specified salt as a percent of total soluble salt content.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 3__________________________________________________________________________10.5 ppg Viscosified Brine2 ppg Bio-Polymer &amp; 2 ppb MgOHeat Aged 16 &amp; 72 Hours @ 180CaCl.sub.2, % TS  100   86    60    31 0CaBr.sub.2, % TS  0     14    40    69 100__________________________________________________________________________Aging Hours  16 72 16 72 16 72 16 72 16 72PV/YP  9/7     7/2        9/18           8/12              9/18                 8/16                    7/21                       7/18                          7/16                             6/12Gels   0/0     0/0        3/3           1/1              5/7                 5/5                    6/8                       6/7                          4/4                             2/2pH     7.4     7.6        7.7           7.8              8.3                 8.3                    8.6                       8.4                          8.1                             8.5Settling  Yes     Yes        No Yes              No No No No No Yes__________________________________________________________________________ % TS  Specified salt as a percent of total soluble salt content.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 4__________________________________________________________________________13.0 ppg Viscosified Brine2 ppg Bio-Polymer &amp; 2 ppb MgOHeat Aged 16 &amp; 72 Hours @ 180CaCl.sub.2, % TS 45     22    16     0CaBr.sub.2, % TS 55     78    84     100__________________________________________________________________________Aging Hours 16 72  16 72 16  72 16 72PV/YP 21/28    24/33        17/21           19/18              16/15                  15/15                     14/15                        -Gels  9/10    9/10        5/6           3/5              1/1 1/1                     1/1                        -pH    6.7    6.8 7.1           7.1              7.5 7.1                     7.2                        -Settling No No  Yes           Yes              Yes Yes                     Yes                        -__________________________________________________________________________ % TS  Specified salt as a percent of total soluble salt content.</pre></p><p>These surprising results were again verified when a Fann Model 50 evaluation was performed on the 10.5 ppg CaCl.sub.2, 10.5 ppg CaBr.sub.2, and 10.5 ppg mixed CaCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2 solutions, this type of test being well known in the art. Results shown in FIG. 2 for the two pure halide systems display a continuous rapid decline in brine viscosity with increasing temperature. Unexpectedly, the mixed halide system shows higher viscosity than either pure halide at a given temperature for a broad range from room temperature to well over 220 initially prepared by adding the biopolymer to the brines and then hydrating each system with the same shearing treatment using a Silverson mixer. When the biopolymer is not completely hydrated, its viscosity increases with heating as the biopolymer fully hydrates. In these experiments the Fann 50 supplies the heat. In the single-salt CaCl.sub.2 and single-salt CaBr.sub.2 experiments the viscosity did not increase when the fluids were heated, indicating that the biopolymer had been fully hydrated. However, with the mixed salt CaCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2 system, the viscosity did increase early in the experiment. In order to establish whether this observation was the result of biopolymer hydration, the experiment was repeated; but this time the CaCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2 mixture was blended from samples of viscosified CaCl.sub.2 which had already been proven to be fully hydrated and of viscosified CaBr.sub.2 which had already been proven to be fully hydrated. This new mixture was undeniably fully hydrated, and yet the results of the repeat experiment were almost exactly as before. This shows that the increase in viscosity seen with the two-salt mixture is not a hydration effect but a true indication of increased stability in the two-salt mixture in comparison with the corresponding single-salt systems of equal density.</p><p>As was mentioned above, T.sub.50 is defined as the temperature at which a fluid's viscosity reaches 50% of its original value measured at about room temperature. The surprising relationship between T.sub.50 and percent CaBr.sub.2 in the 10.5 ppg system is clearly demonstrated in FIG. 3.</p><p>Application of this invention to optimization of calcium-based brines can result in viscosified brines having unexpected and greatly improved stability. This substantial increase in stability permits the practical use of these brines for things such as drilling brines, drill-in fluids, fluid loss control pills and hydraulic fracturing fluids.</p><heading>EXAMPLE FIVE</heading><heading>NaBr/CaBr.sub.2</heading><p>The present inventors have discovered that by taking a CaBr.sub.2 solution which can be viscosified with xanthan gum and weighting the solution to a higher density with dry NaBr, instead of CaBr.sub.2 or CaCl.sub.2, the time required to reach maximum viscosity is reduced substantially. Results of adding 3 pounds per barrel (ppb) of xanthan gum to 14.2 ppg solutions, one a pure CaBr.sub.2 solution and the other a mixed CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr solution, are shown in Table 5. Surprisingly, the two salt mixture began to viscosity after only 10 minutes of shearing, while the CaBr.sub.2 solution required significantly more time and shear. The yield point (YP) for a solution is a good measure for the degree of polymer activation. The YP for the mixed CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr salt system reached 12% of its final value in the first 10 minutes while the pure CaBr.sub.2 system had none of its ultimate value. The two salt mixture fully viscosified within 22 hours of stirring after shearing while the CaBr.sub.2 solution did not do so even after 42 hours of stirring.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 5__________________________________________________________________________14.2 ppg Solutions + 3 ppb of Xanthan GumCaBr.sub.2    CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr          CaBr.sub.2                CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr                      CaBr.sub.2                          CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr                                CaBr.sub.2                                     CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr__________________________________________________________________________600 22   44    30    71    83  144   104  148300 11   26    16    47    56  106   72   1086   0    2     0     6     7   24    13   253   0    1     0     4     5   19    9    20Gels    0/0  1/1   0/0   4/5   5/8 20/48 10/21                                     24/56PV  11   18    14    24    27  38    32   40YP  0    8     2     23    29  68    40   68Method    Sheared-    10 Min.

The 13.0 ppg pure CaBr.sub.2 solution shows no T.sub.m, but with the introduction of NaBr, the T.sub.m increases with increasing concentrations of NaBr. In FIG. 5, T.sub.50 is plotted versus the pounds of NaBr per barrel (ppb) of fluid. Unexpectedly, NaBr was found to substantially increase the T.sub.50 of the mixed CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr brine fluids. This shows that the mixed salt system provides higher thermal stability than the pure CaBr.sub.2 solution.</p><p>To determine whether the mixed CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr salt system also increases the thermal stability of other polysaccharides, such as pre-gelatinized starch, which show no transition temperature, a heating and cooling cycle was conducted on 12 ppb of a pre-gelatinized starch added to a 13.0 ppg pure CaBr.sub.2 solution and compared with 12 ppb of pre-gelatinized starch added to a 13.0 ppg mixed CaBr.sub.2 /NaBr salt system. The mixed salt system was prepared by taking 11.0 ppg CaBr.sub.2 and weighting it up with dry NaBr until a 13.0 ppg solution was obtained. Each solution was heated at 2.56.degree. F./minute in 20 rate of 170 sec.sup.-1 beginning at 120 to 70 the pre-gelatinized starch was determined and is shown in FIG. 6.

Two different ratios of LiBr to NaBr were tested and in both cases the data show improved stability for the xanthan-viscosified LiBr/NaBr mixed salt system in comparison with viscosified pure LiBr and viscosified pure NaBr. For example, if one interpolates linearly between the T.sub.50 for 12.5 ppg LiBr, 114 F. to predict the T.sub.50 of the mixture, the actually observed T.sub.50 values for the LiBr/NaBr mixtures are greater than those predicted. This comparison is illustrated graphically in FIG. 7 in which the T.sub.50 values are plotted versus the pounds of LiBr added per barrel of fluid.

First, the Table 9 data showed little or no difference at 16 hours, and only at 72 hours did a significant difference appear; the data in Table 10 are from tests which span less than two hours. If differences only appear after an extended duration they cannot be seen in data such as those of Table 10. Second, the Table 10 T.sub.m and T.sub.50 data are all relatively high temperatures and the densities of the brines involved are all relatively low, 9.0 ppg. For other mixed brine systems, we have such data for generally higher brine densities, and often observe T.sub.m and T.sub.50 values for the viscosified pure salts which are much lower than those of Table 10. In mixed salt brines having higher densities and lower T.sub.m and T.sub.50 values for the viscosified pure salts, it is apparently easier to observe the benefit of improved stability due to the presence of the mixed brines when observing over the course of short experiments such as those of Table 10.

Even the 65% MgCl.sub.2 /35% CaBr.sub.2 heat aged sample yielded improved properties compared to the pure CaBr.sub.2 system.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 15______________________________________11.0 ppg MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2 -based Drilling BrinesInitial Rheological Properties      100%    65/35%     35/65%   100%System     MgCl.sub.2              MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2                         MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2                                  CaBr.sub.2______________________________________Rheological      Room    Room       Room     RoomProperties Temp    Temp       Temp     Temp6/3 RPM    20/18   15/14      12/11    6/8Gels       21/24   14/19      11/16    12/13PV         31      25         16       11YP         38      35         29       22Sample Temp,       120     120        120      120______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 16______________________________________11.0 ppg MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2 -based Drilling BrinesHeat-aged Rheological Properties    100%     65/35%     35/65%   100%System   MgCl.sub.2             MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2                        MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2                                 CaBr.sub.2______________________________________Rheological    16 Hours 16 Hours   16 Hours 16 HoursProperties    180             180                        180                                 1806/3 RPM  17/14    15/12      39/36    6/4Gels     18/21    14/17      39/44    5/6PV       22       23         61       12YP       32       37         43       20Sample Temp,    120      120        120      120______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 17______________________________________11.0 ppg MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2 -based Drilling BrinesHeat-aged Rheological Properties    100%     65/35%     35/65%   100%System   MgCl.sub.2             MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2                        MgCl.sub.2 /CaBr.sub.2                                 CaBr.sub.2______________________________________Rheological    62 Hours 62 Hours   62 Hours 62 HoursProperties    180             180                        180                                 1806/3 RPM  19/16    19/16      33/29    6/4Gels     18/20    16/19      27/29    6/6PV       20       28         60       11YP       36       42         30       21Sample Temp,    120      120        120      120______________________________________</pre></p><heading>EXAMPLE FIFTEEN</heading><heading>CaBr.sub.2 /Ca(NO.sub.3).sub.2</heading><p>Table 18 presents T.sub.m data for the 13.0 ppg CaBr.sub.2 /Ca(NO.sub.3).sub.2 mixed salt system.

Smith, Critical Stability Constants, Volume 4, p. 115, Volume 5, p. 421, and Volume 6, page 459, (New York: Plenum Press, 1989). The above list can obviously be augmented with non-ionic zinc complexing agents such as NH.sub.3, H.sub.2 S, CH.sub.3 I, and various other organics, such as, for example, primary amines like isopropanolamine, secondary amines such as methyl ethanolamine, and tertiary amines, including triethanolamine. Additionally, two or more of the complexing agents, Y.sup.- and Z.sup.-, may be supplied by different parts of a single moiety. For example, both the citrate and oxalate anion molecules comprise more than one carboxylate group, two of which can be attached as ligands to a given zinc ion just as easily as can each carboxylate group serve as a ligand for separate zinc ions.</p><p>Possible variants of Reaction 1 include the following:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn.sup.2+ +V.sup.- +W.sup.- +X.sup.- +Y.sup.- +Z.sup.- ⃡ZnVWXYZ.sup.3-                               (1a)</pre></p><p>and</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn.sup.2+ +W.sup.- +X.sup.- +Y.sup.- +Z.sup.- ⃡ZnWXYZ.sup.2-(1b)</pre></p><p>In the Table 19 systems, U.sup.-, V.sup.-, W.sup.-, X.sup.-, Y.sup.-, and Z.sup.- are all embodied in Reaction 1 as the bromide anion and therefore ZnUVWXYZ.sup.4- as the ZnBr.sub.6.sup.4- anion, ZnVWXYZ.sup.3- as the ZnBr.sub.5.sup.3- anion, ZnWXYZ.sup.2- as the ZnBr.sub.4.sup.2- anion, etc. The reason for the need to get the bromide anion concentration high is seen in another variant of Reaction 1, given below as Reaction 2, and its further variants:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn.sup.2+ +H.sub.2 O+V.sup.- +W.sup.- +X.sup.- +Y.sup.- +Z.sup.- ⃡Zn(OH)VWXYZ.sup.4- +H.sup.+                  (2)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn.sup.2+ +H.sub.2 O+W.sup.- +X.sup.- +Y.sup.- +Z.sup.- ⃡Zn(OH)WXYZ.sup.3- +H.sup.+                   (2a)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->and Zn.sup.2+ +H.sub.2 O+X.sup.- +Y.sup.- +Z.sup.- ⃡Zn(OH)XYZ.sup.2- +H.sup.+                    (2b)</pre></p><p>Since the Table 19 systems are water-based, there is therefore a tendency for the zinc to hydrolyze in accordance with Reaction 2, releasing H.sup.+ and reducing the pH. At low pH, the thermal decomposition of biopolymers and common fluid loss control materials is accelerated. To avoid this undesirable consequence, consider the combination of Reactions 1 and 2, which is Reaction 3 and its variants, below:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)VWXYZ.sup.4- +H.sup.+ +U.sup.- ⃡ZnUVWXYZ.sup.4- +H.sub.2 O(3)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)WXYZ.sup.3- +H.sup.+ +V.sup.- ⃡ZnVWXYZ.sup.3- +H.sub.2 O(3a)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->and Zn(OH)XYZ.sup.2- +H.sup.+ +W.sup.- ⃡ZnWXYZ.sup.2- +H.sub.2 O(3b)</pre></p><p>In water-based zinc brines, accordingly, having an excess of bromide anion or any other strongly zinc-complexing agent will, through the action of LeChatelier's principle upon Reaction 3, shift the equilibrium to the right and diminish the concentration of H.sup.+. Notice in Table 19 that the highest pH values are seen in the last column, where the highest level of added salt and lowest rate of thermal decomposition of biopolymers and common fluid loss control materials are also to be found.

However, having an excess of bromide anion or any other strongly zinc-complexing agent to serve in the roles of V.sup.-, W.sup.-, and X.sup.-, in these reactions will, through the action, again, of LeChatelier's principle shift the equilibria to the left and diminish the concentration of H.sup.+.</p><p>Considering the center two columns in Table 19, it is apparent that adding about 20 ppb of calcium bromide is somewhat more effective in increasing the pH and extending the durability of the formulation than adding about the same weight of NaBr.</p><p>It should be noted that while the added soluble salts were acting in the role of a pH buffer, conventional pH buffering agent was added to each drill-in fluid given in Table 19. The amount added would have been, for most other base brine systems, sufficient to keep the pH well above 5. Instead, none of the fluids in Table 19 had such a relatively high pH. This fact is a reflection of the strong pH control resulting from the base brine chemistry (Reactions 1-3 and variants) and negligible pH control induced by the presence of the 10 ppb of pH buffering agent. The point is underscored that obtaining a desirably low rate of thermal decomposition is possible especially by proper control of the pH through control of brine chemistry (especially Reactions 3 and variants), rather than through the addition of conventional pH buffering agents.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 19__________________________________________________________________________17.5 ppg Viscosified ZnBr.sub.2 -based Brine2 ppb Bio-Polymer, 4 ppb Fluid Loss Control Material, &amp; 10 ppb pH BufferHeat Aged 16, 40, &amp; 96 Hours @ 180__________________________________________________________________________NaBr added, ppb    20.25       0           0CaBr.sub.2 added, ppb    0           19.5        83.9Base Brine System    17.5 ppg CaZnBr.sub.4 /                17.5 ppg CaZnBr.sub.4 /                            17.5 ppg CaZnBr.sub.4 /    Ca.sub.3 (ZnBr.sub.5).sub.2 /                Ca.sub.3 (ZnBr.sub.5).sub.2 /                            Ca.sub.3 (ZnBr.sub.5).sub.2 /    Ca.sub.2 ZnBr.sub.6 /NaBr                Ca.sub.2 ZnBr.sub.6 /CaBr.sub.2                            Ca.sub.2 ZnBr.sub.6 /CaBr.sub.2Heat Aging Hours    16   40 96  16   40 96  16  40  96PV/YP    53/75         49/34            --/--.sup.a                60/82                     60/78                        34/9.sup.b                            104/80                                118/84                                    15/82.sup.cGels     23/17         7/5            --/--.sup.a                23/17                     7/5                        1/1.sup.b                            19/19                                16/17                                    11/12.sup.cpH       2.76 2.57            --.sup.a                3.10 2.82                        2.74.sup.b                            3.77                                3.83                                    3.75.sup.cSettling No   No Yes No   No Yes No  No  NoReference    BW3-62      BW3-58      RH2-6__________________________________________________________________________ Note .sup.a : The pH and rheology were not measured because the biopolyme and fluid loss control material bad very severely degraded at this point in the rolling heataging.

FIG. 11 presents the data from the last two columns in Table 21: pH is plotted versus the logarithm of the molar ratio of total halides to zinc. The logical justification of the form of the plot in FIG. 11 can be seen from considering Equation 4, which defines the function pZn-pX: ##EQU7## Since pH is -log[H.sup.+ ], a function of similar form to pZn-pX, it makes sense to plot pH as the vertical axis in FIG. 11. The horizontal axis in FIG. 11, log {(Total Moles X.sup.-)/(Moles Zn)}, is actually pZn-pX. Surprisingly, over three quarters of the data cluster about the straight line shown in FIG. 11 in the vicinity ranging from pH 2 to about pH 4.5. Then the pH breaks over and appears to level off around pH 5.1 to 5.5. The transition occurs around log{X.sup.- /Zn.sup.2+ }=pZn-pX=log{6}, i. e., around X.sup.- /Zn.sup.2+ =6. This ratio is consistent with an interpretation that a stable zinc complex anion stoichiometry, ZnX.sub.6.sup.4-, has been reached in this vicinity; and low pH forms like Zn(OH)X.sub.5.sup.4- have been minimized or even largely eliminated, as indicated in Reaction 5, and its variants, below:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.5.sup.4- +H.sup.+ +Br.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.6.sup.4- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.5.sup.4- +H.sup.+ +Cl.sup.- ⃡ZnClBr.sub.5.sup.4- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5a)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.5.sup.4- +H.sup.+ +I.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.5 I.sup.4- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5b)</pre></p><p>  . .</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)ClBr.sub.4.sup.4- +H.sup.+ +Cl.sup.- ⃡ZnCl.sub.2 Br.sub.4.sup.4- +H.sub.2 O                                (5c)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.4 I.sup.4- +H.sup.+ +I.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.4 I.sub.2.sup.4- +H.sub.2 O                                 (5d)</pre></p><p>  . . .</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.4.sup.3- +H.sup.+ +Br.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.5.sup.3- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5e)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.4.sup.3- +H.sup.+ +Cl.sup.- ⃡ZnClBr.sub.4.sup.3- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5f)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.4.sup.3- +H.sup.+ +I.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.4 I.sup.3- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5g)</pre></p><p>  . .</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)ClBr.sub.3.sup.3- +H.sup.+ +Cl.sup.- ⃡ZnCl.sub.2 Br.sub.3.sup.3- +H.sub.2 O                                (5h)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.3.sup.3- +H.sup.+ +I.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.3 I.sub.2.sup.3- +H.sub.2 O                                 (5i)</pre></p><p>  . . .</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.3.sup.2- +H.sup.+ +Br.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.4.sup.2- +H.sub.2                                                  (5j)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.3.sup.2- +H.sup.+ +Cl.sup.- ⃡ZnClBr.sub.3.sup.2- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5k)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)Br.sub.3.sup.2- +H.sup.+ +I.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.3 I.sup.2- +H.sub.2 O                                                (5l)</pre></p><p>  . .</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Zn(OH)ClBr.sub.2.sup.2- +H.sup.+ +Cl.sup.- ⃡ZnCl.sub.2 Br.sub.2.sup.2- +H.sub.2 O                                (5m)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->and Zn(OH)Br.sub.2 I.sup.2- +H.sup.+ +I.sup.- ⃡ZnBr.sub.2 I.sub.2.sup.2- +H.sub.2 O                                 (5n)</pre></p><p>  . . .</p><heading>EXAMPLE SEVENTEEN</heading><heading>USES OF INVENTIVE DENSE, VISCOSIFIED AQUEOUS COMPOSITIONS</heading><p>Inventive compositions find advantageous use as replacements for conventional drilling, drill-in, completion, hydraulic fracturing, work-over, packer, well treating, testing, spacer, or hole abandonment fluids, these uses being well known in the art to which the invention pertains.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What is claimed is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
