particularly, to acrylic/epoxy adhesives that are heat and impact resistant and have
increased adhesive bonding capabilities.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0002">Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in
connection with characteristics of various adhesives.</p><p num="0003">Acrylic-based adhesives have been used in applications that require
compositions exhibiting fast curing and flexible adhesive qualities. While acrylic-based
adhesives are generally good for causing adhesion to difficult substrates such as plastics,
they often have undesirable heat resistance. Curable epoxy resins have also been used as
adhesive compositions. Epoxy adhesives form a tight polymer network and generally
exhibit desirable thermal properties. Epoxy adhesives, however, tend not to bond to
plastics well and tend to be brittle and exhibit poor impact strength. Generally, epoxies
are slow curing which renders them inappropriate for many industrial applications.</p><p num="0004">Many adhesives exhibit poor physical properties such as decreased impact
strength, poor adhesive bonding capabilities, and setting times, depending on the
application. Adding impact modifiers and other copolymers to the adhesive may
improve these physical characteristics. Unfortunately, while impact modifiers tend to
improve some physical properties, they typically exhibit poor heat resistance. With the
use of more and more plastics in industrial applications such as for example, automobile
assembly, there is a continuing need for adhesives that can be used on plastics as well as 
metals to form adhesive bonds that will hold up under a wide variety of adverse
conditions.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0005">There is a need for a novel, quick setting, room temperature curable
adhesive which combines the room temperature curing and quick setting features of
acrylic-based adhesives with the heat resistant qualities of epoxy resin-based adhesives.
Also, an adhesive is needed which is heat and impact resistant and can bond difficult
substrates:</p><p num="0006">One embodiment of the present invention is a heat and impact resistant
adhesive. The adhesive includes at least one acrylic-based monomer, at least one epoxy
based monomer/resin, at least one bifunctional monomer chemically reactive with the
acrylic-based monomer and the epoxy based monomer/resin, at least one impact
modifier, and a catalyst system. Adhesives of the present invention also may contain at
least one elastomer.</p><p num="0007">Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for making an
adhesive. The method includes the steps of contacting a mixture with an activator,
wherein the mixture contains at least one acrylic-based monomer, at least one epoxy
based monomer/resin, at least one bifunctional molecule reactable with the acrylic-based
monomer and the epoxy based monomer/resin, at least one impact modifier, and a
catalyst system.</p><p num="0008">Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for bonding two
surfaces. The method includes the steps of mixing at least one acrylic-based monomer, at
least one epoxy based monomer/resin, at least one bifunctional molecule reactable with 
the acrylic-based monomer and the epoxy based monomer/resin, at least one impact
modifier, and a catalyst system to form a mixture; applying the mixture to a first surface;
applying an activator to a second surface; and contacting the first surface with the second
surface.</p><p num="0009">Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for bonding two
surfaces. The method includes the steps of mixing at least one acrylic-based monomer, at
least one epoxy based monomer/resin, at least one bifunctional molecule reactable with
the acrylic-based monomer and the epoxy based monomer/resin, at least one impact
modifier, a catalyst system and an activator; applying the mixture to a first surface or a
second surface; and contacting the first surface with the second surface.</p><heading><u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0010">While the making and using of various embodiments of the present
invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention
provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of
specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of
specific ways to make and use the invention, and are not meant to limit the scope of the
invention.</p><p num="0011">Adhesives of the present invention have improved adhesive bonding
capabilities as well as improved impact resistance and heat resistance. Adhesives of the
present invention contain acrylic-based monomers and epoxy based monomer/resins that
are polymerized using an acrylic/epoxy polymerization curing system. The present
inventors have discovered that using a polymerization system that utilizes both an
acrylic-based curing system and an epoxy-based curing system results in an improved 
adhesive. Adhesives of the present invention also include impact modifiers that improve
impact strength, adhesion, and handling properties, and also include elastomers that
improve flexibility and adhesion.</p><heading><b>Monomers</b></heading><p num="0012">As used herein, the term acrylic-based monomer or acrylic-based adhesive
component is used generically and generally refers to compounds exhibiting the chemical
structure:
<img id="img-00040001" orientation="unknown"  wi="62" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00040001.tif" inline="no"  he="34"/></p><p num="0013">Where R<sub>1</sub>, for example, can be hydrogen, a methyl group or an ethyl
group. "Acrylic-based" is defined to encompass both acids and salts of acids. For
example, acrylic-based compounds may include acrylic acid and acrylates. Acrylic-based
compounds may include acrylate-based, and methacrylate based compounds. The terms
acrylic-, acrylate-, and methacryate-based, are simply a convenient means for labeling
where functional groups are located on an adhesive component and are used
interchangeably. Using the structure above as an example, when R and R<sub>1</sub> are both
hydrogen, the acrylic-based adhesive component is known as acrylic acid (an organic
acid). When R is hydrogen, and when R<sub>1</sub> is a methyl group, the acrylic-based adhesive
component is known as methacrylic acid. When R is a methyl group, and R<sub>1</sub> is hydrogen,
the acrylic-based adhesive component is known as methyl acrylate, and the acrylic-based
adhesive component is said to be acrylate-based. Acrylate-based components generally
exhibit the chemical structure (H<sub>2</sub>C=CH-COO--). When R and R<sub>1</sub> are both methyl 
groups, the acrylic-based adhesive component is known as methyl methacrylate (MMA),
and is said to be methacrylate-based. Methacrylate-based components generally exhibit
the chemical structure (H<sub>2</sub>C=CCH<sub>3</sub>COO--).</p><p num="0014">Acrylic-based monomers useful in the present invention include, but are
not limited to, acrylate-based, and methacrylate-based monomers. Acrylate-based
monomers include acrylate esters wherein the alcohol portion of the ester contains from
about one to about twenty carbon atoms. Examples of which include, but are not limited
to, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, and the like and
mixtures thereof. Methacrylate-based monomers include methacrylate ester monomers
wherein the alcohol portion of the ester group contains from about one to about twenty
carbon atoms. Examples of such ester monomers include, but are not limited to, methyl
methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate,
ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate, and the like and mixtures thereof. Butyl
methacrylate and tetra hydrofurfuryl methacrylate can also be used. Other useful
monomers include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, styrene, vinyl toluene, and the like. In
one embodiment of the present invention, the acrylic-based monomer is MMA or methyl
methacrylate.</p><p num="0015">Adhesives of the present invention contain acrylic-based monomers
present in an amount sufficient to form adhesives that are impact and heat resistant and
have increased adhesive bonding capabilities. In one embodiment of the present
invention, acrylic-based monomers are present in an amount in the range of from about
30 to about 60 weight percent, based on the weight of the adhesive. In another
embodiment of the present invention, acrylic-based monomers are present in an amount 
in the range of from about 40 to about 55 weight percent, based on the weight of the
adhesive. In another embodiment of the present invention, acrylic-based monomers are
present in an amount in the range of from about 45 to about 55 weight percent of the
adhesive.</p><p num="0016">As used herein, "epoxide based monomer" or "epoxide" or "epoxide
resin" or "epoxy" or "epoxy based monomer/resin" are used interchangeably and refer to
compounds containing a three-member "epoxide" group or ring, as shown below, as an
integral part of the chemical structure.
<img id="img-00060001"  orientation="unknown"  wi="40" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060001.tif" inline="no" he="25"/></p><p num="0017">Epoxy based monomer/resins useful in the present invention include, but
are not limited to, diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and F, and aliphatic and cycloaliphatic
epoxies. Other examples include, but are not limited to, 3,4-epoxy cyclohexyl methyl-3,4-epoxy
cyclohexyl carboxylate (ERL-4221 from Union Carbide), and sorbitol glycidyl
ether (Erisys GE-60 from CVC Specialty Chemicals).</p><p num="0018">Adhesives of the present invention contain epoxy based monomer/resins
present in an amount sufficient to form adhesives that are impact and heat resistant and
have increased adhesive bonding capabilities. Generally, the epoxy based monomer/resin
level may depend, in part, on post cure conditions (e.g., excess heat). In one embodiment
of the present invention, epoxy based monomer/resins are present in an amount greater
than about 40 weight percent based on the weight of the adhesive. In another
embodiment of the present invention, epoxy based monomer/resins are present in an
amount in the range of from about 2 to about 40 weight percent based on the weight of 
the adhesive. In another embodiment of the present invention, epoxy based
monomer/resins are present in an amount in the range of from about 3 to about 16 weight
percent based on the weight of the adhesive.</p><heading><b>Polymerization Systems</b></heading><p num="0019">It is generally known in the art that polymerization of acrylic-based
monomers proceeds by a free radical addition polymerization mechanism. Useful
examples of acrylic-based curing systems include, but are not limited to systems using
sulfonyl chloride compounds. These systems generally combine sulfonyl chloride
compounds with reducing agents, such as dihydropyridine (also known as an amine-aldehyde
condensation product) to generate radicals that polymerize the acrylic-based
monomer. Curing systems based on sulfonyl chlorides are generally described in U.S.
Patents 3,890,407; 4,112,013; 4,182,644; 4,536,546; 4,714,730; 4,773,957; and
4,959,405, the entirety of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="0020">Other examples of acrylic-based curing systems include systems that use
peroxides and toludine reducing agents. These systems generally combine a peroxide, for
example, benzoyl peroxide, with a toluidine reducing agent to generate radicals which
polymerize the acrylic-based monomer. Curing systems based on peroxide/toluidine
systems are described in U.S. Patents 4,942,201; 5,112,691; and 5,206,288, the entireties
of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="0021">Epoxy polymerization generally is the result of various chemicals opening
and bonding to the epoxy ring. Typical organic chemicals that may react with epoxies
include, but are not limited to, acids, mercaptans, amines and amides. Epoxy rings are
usually part of a much larger molecule. For example, the backbone may be an aliphatic 
organic molecule, a cyclic organic molecule, an aromatic organic molecule, or any
combination thereof. When there are two epoxies on one molecule and two reactive
groups on the compound being added to the epoxy, the molecular weight grows as the
ends react together and a polymer is formed.</p><p num="0022">Adhesives of the present invention are formed using an acrylic/epoxy
polymerization system that utilizes both an acrylic-based curing system and an epoxy-based
curing system. The present inventors have found that such an acrylic/epoxy
polymerization system may be accomplished by driving the reaction using a "bi-functional"
molecule, which has epoxy-based reactive groups and acrylic-based reactive
groups on the same molecule. As used herein, a "bi-functional" molecule or monomer
refers to a molecule that contains two different chemically reactive functional groups.
For example, methacrylic acid contains an acrylic-based functional group and an epoxide
reactive group. For purposes of illustrating the present invention, bi-functional molecules
include molecules having two functional groups where one functional group is capable of
reacting with epoxide groups and another functional group is capable of reacting with
acrylic-based functional groups. Examples of bi-functional molecules are included in
U.S. Patent No. 4,426,243, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="0023">In contrast, a "di-functional" molecule refers to a molecule that contains
two identical chemically reactive groups. For example, an ethoxylated bisphenol A
dimethacrylate molecule has two methacrylate functional groups. Another example is a
bisphenol A diepoxide molecule that has two epoxide functional groups. In the same
sense, trimethylolpropane [2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol] trimethacrylate 
is an example of a "tri-functional" molecule because it contains three methacrylate
functional groups.</p><p num="0024">A variety of suitable chemical species may be used as the backbone of a
bi-functional molecule. For example, bisphenol A, also known as 4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol
may be used. The chemical structure of bisphenol A is shown
below:
<img id="img-00090001" orientation="unknown" wi="69" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00090001.tif" inline="no" he="23"/></p><p num="0025">Typical diepoxide-based molecules that may be used in the present
invention include diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A, and a typical diacrylic-based molecule
includes ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate. As is known by those skilled in the art,
these two examples of difunctional molecules are structurally similar, but chemically
distinct.</p><p num="0026">Examples of bi-functional molecules useful in the present invention
include, but are not limited to, MAA (methacrylic acid), AMPS 2404 (2-acrylamido-2-methyl
propanesulfonic acid available from the Lubrizol Corp), P2M (2-Hydroxyethylmethacrylate
phosphoric acid partial ester available from Kyoeisha
Chemical Co.), and the like and mixtures thereof. Adhesives of the present invention
contain bi-functional molecules in an amount sufficient to produce adhesives that are heat
and impact resistant and have increased adhesive bonding capabilities. The amount of
bifunctional molecule present in adhesives of the present invention generally may vary,
depending on various conditions. In one embodiment of the present invention, bi-functional
molecules are present in an amount up to about 20 weight percent, based on 
the weight of the adhesive. In another embodiment of the present invention, bi-functional
molecules are present in an amount in the range of from about 2 to about 15 weight
percent based on the weight of the adhesive. In another embodiment, bi-functional
molecules are present in an amount in the range of from about 2 to about 10 weight
percent based on the weight of the adhesive.</p><p num="0027">The amount of bifunctional molecule present in adhesives of the present
invention may affect the concentration of epoxy based monomer/resins present in the
adhesive. In one embodiment of the present invention, the bifunctional monomer is
present in an amount in the range of from up to about 2 weight percent, based on the
weight of the adhesive, and the adhesive has a bifunctional monomer to epoxy based
monomer/resin mole ratio in the range of from about 1:1 or greater epoxy based
monomer/resin. In another embodiment of the present invention, the bifunctional
monomer is present in an amount greater than about 2 weight percent, based on the
weight of the adhesive, and the adhesive has a bifunctional monomer to epoxy based
monomer/resin mole ratio of about 1:0.3 or greater epoxy.</p><p num="0028">Bi-functional molecules of the present invention may be used with
different combinations of curing systems to produce adhesives of the present invention.
For example, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a bi-functional
molecule may be used in connection with an acrylic/epoxy cure system based on sulfonyl
chloride (acrylic-based monomers) and epoxy polymerization (epoxy based
monomer/resins). In another embodiment of the present invention, a bi-functional
molecule may be used in connection with an acrylic/epoxy cure system based on
peroxide/toluidine (acrylic-based monomers) and epoxy polymerization (epoxy based 
monomer/resins). In one embodiment of the present invention, adhesives of the present
invention contain at least one acrylic-based monomer, at least one epoxy based
monomer/resin, at least one bi-functional molecule, at least one impact modifier, at least

one impact modifier. In one embodiment of the present invention, the impact modifier
contains a core-shell graft co-polymer. Core-shell graft copolymer resins useful in the
present invention generally have a rubbery core and a hard outer shell, and swell in the
adhesive mixture but do not dissolve therein. The adhesives, so formulated, exhibit
improved spreading and flow properties that are highly desirable in many adhesive
applications. For example, when an adhesive is applied to an article by means of a 
syringe-type application, many adhesives string out between the point where the
applicator was applied and the next position of the applicator. With the present
invention, a small drop of adhesive may be applied to the article to be bonded with no
adhesive string-out formed. The core or backbone polymer of the graft copolymer has a
glass transition temperature substantially below ambient temperature. The shell polymer
that is grafted onto the backbone polymer has a glass transition temperature substantially
above ambient temperatures.</p><p num="0039">Examples of useful core-shell graft copolymers are those where hard
containing compounds, such as styrene, acrylonitrile or methyl methacrylate, are grafted
onto a rubbery core made from polymers of soft or elastomeric containing compounds
such as butadiene or ethyl acrylate. U.S. Patent No. 3,985,703, which is herein
incorporated by reference, describes useful core-shell polymers, the cores of which are
made from butyl acrylate but can be based on ethyl isobutyl, 2-ethylhexel or other alkyl
acrylates or mixtures thereof. The core polymer, may optionally contain up to 20 weight
percent of other copolymerizable containing compounds, such as styrene, vinyl acetate,
methyl methacrylate, butadiene, isoprene, and the like. The core polymer may optionally
contain up to 5 weight percent of a cross linking monomer having two or more
nonconjugated double bonds of approximately equal reactivity such as ethylene glycol
diacrylate, butylene glycol dimethacrylate, and the like. It also optionally may contain up
to 5 weight percent of a graft linking monomer having two or more nonconjugated double
bonds of unequal reactivity such as, for example, diallyl maleate and allyl methacrylate.</p><p num="0040">The shell portion may be polymerized from methyl methacrylate and
optionally other lower alkyl methacrylates, such as ethyl, butyl, or mixtures thereof. Up 
to 40 percent by weight of the shell monomers may be styrene, vinyl acetate, vinyl
chloride, and the like. Additional core-shell graft copolymers useful in embodiments of
the present invention are described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,984,497; 4,096,202; 4,034,013;

herein incorporated by reference. Examples of core-shell graft copolymers include, but
are not limited to, "MBS" (methacrylate-butadiene-styrene) polymers, which are made by
polymerizing methyl methacrylate in the presence of polybutadiene or a polybutadiene
copolymer rubber. The MBS graft copolymer resin generally has a styrene butadiene
rubber core and a shell of acrylic polymer or copolymer. Examples of other useful core-shell
graft copolymer resins include, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene), MABS
(methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene), ASA (acrylate-styrene-acrylonitrile), all
acrylics, SA EPDM (styrene-acrylonitrile grafted onto elastomeric backbones of

like and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0041">Examples of useful impact modifiers include, but are not limited to,
Paraloid BTA 753, commercially available from Rohm &amp; Haas Co. and Blendex B983,
commercially available from GE Specialty Chemicals. Adhesives of the present
invention contain impact modifiers present in an amount sufficient to form adhesives that
are impact and heat resistant and have increased adhesive bonding capabilities. In one
embodiment of the present invention, impact modifiers are present in an amount in the
range of from about 5 to about 35 weight percent, based on the weight of the adhesive. In
another embodiment of the present invention, impact modifiers are present in an amount
in the range of from about 10 to about 30 weight percent, based on the weight of the 
adhesive. In another embodiment of the present invention, impact modifiers are present
in an amount in the range of from about 15 to about 25 weight percent, based on the
weight of the adhesive.</p><heading><b>Elastomers</b></heading><p num="0042">In one embodiment of the present invention, the adhesive contains at least
one elastomer. Elastomers useful in this invention are described in detail in the
"Handbook of Plastics and Elastomers" pages 1-106-119, (1975) McGraw-Hill, Inc.,
which is hereby incorporated by reference. Elastomers useful in the present invention

wherein the copolymer contains at least 30 weight percent acrylate ester.</p><p num="0045">In one embodiment of the present invention, elastomers are soluble in the
monomers used in the adhesives of this invention. For example, the elastomers may form
solutions of from about 10 to about 50 weight percent elastomer in the acrylic-based
monomer, such as for example, methyl methacrylate. In another embodiment of the
present invention, the elastomer is present in an amount in the range of from about 15 to
about 40 weight percent elastomer in the acrylic-based monomer. As used herein the
term "solution" is intended to include colloidal dispersion that exhibit normal or
substantially Newtonian rheology characteristics.</p><p num="0046">Adhesives of the present invention may be prepared in two parts wherein
one part contains the free radical catalyst(s) and the other part contains an initiator (and a
promoter if one is used). Just prior to use, the two parts may be mixed together and
applied to at least one of the surfaces to be bonded. Alternatively, the part containing the
catalyst may be applied to one surface and the part containing the activator may be
applied to the other surface. When contacted, the two parts mix together and
polymerization with resultant adhesive bonding takes place. </p><p num="0047">The following examples are presented to further illustrate the present
invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 1 - TABLE I</b></heading><p num="0048">Adhesives of the present invention were formulated using techniques
known to one skilled in the art as exemplified in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,959,288 and 5,206, 288,
the entireties of which are incorporated by reference. As shown in Table I, adhesives of
the present invention were formed using a peroxide/toluidine polymerization system.
The adhesive side of the adhesive was prepared by mixing together an elastomer, bi-functional
molecule, monomer, monomer cross-linker, reducing agent, an additive (wax),
and an impact modifier. The elastomer used in the present example was a 52.65 weight
percent sample of either 25% Kraton D1116/MMA (SBS block co-polymer) or 25%
Neoprene AD-10/MMA (polychloroprene). The bi-functional molecule used, P2M (2-Hydroxyethylmethacrylate
phosphoric acid partial ester), contained methacrylate and
phosphoric acid functionality on the molecule. The monomer used was MMA (methyl
methacrylate). 10 weight percent of a monomer cross-linker, EGDMA (ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate) was mixed with the other components. In addition, 1.35 weight percent
of reducing agent HET (hydroxyethyltolune), 3 weight percent wax IGI 1230 wax/MMA
and 18 weight percent IM B564 (impact modifier) was added to the mixture.</p><p num="0049">The activator side of the adhesive was prepared by combining an epoxy-based
monomer/resin with an oxidizing agent (benzoyl peroxide), an impact modifier,
and a plasticizer. The activator portion was then added to the adhesive portion and
allowed to cure. Nine adhesives (samples A-I) were prepared and are illustrated in Table
I. Each sample was labeled for illustrative purposes with two numbers (numeral + prime 
(') for the adhesive side and numeral + double prime (") for the activator side). The
purpose of this labeling system was to facilitate comparisons of the reactant
concentrations in the adhesive and activator sides of the adhesive. For example, Samples
A-D, and I all correspond to adhesive 1' and thus have the same concentrations of
reactants in the adhesive side of the mixture.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 1 - TABLE II</b></heading><p num="0050">Example 1 also illustrates properties of adhesives of the present invention,
including but not limited to, room temperature curing, improved impact strength, heat
resistance and adhesive bonding capabilities. Samples A-I were analyzed for various
physical properties, the results of which are contained in Table II. Four different tests
were conducted. The first test conducted was a shear adhesion test based on ASTM
method D1002. The bond specimens were prepared by mixing the adhesive and activator
and placing the mixture on grit blasted, solvent cleaned steel strips along with a few .030
inch diameter beads to control the bond thickness. A 1-inch overlap was used. The
specimens were cured overnight at room temperature. The results are shown in Table II.</p><p num="0051">After the bond strengths were tested, each sample was identified according
to the "failure mode" it exhibited. Cohesive Failure (CF) represented that a thin layer of
adhesive stayed on one surface of the sample and the other surface of the sample had the
rest of the cured adhesive. Adhesive Failure (AF) represented that the cured adhesive
released from the surface when the bond strength was tested. As shown in Table II,
Sample H (no bi-functional molecule) exhibited adhesive failure and much lower bond
strength than sample B, which is the same except for the bifunctional monomer. Samples
A-G and I exhibited thin layer cohesive failure. </p><p num="0052">The second test conducted was a cure exothermic test on a 10g mass of
adhesive and activator mixed at the indicated ratio. The adhesive was allowed to cure
and the curing was timed in order to determine the time it took for the mixture to reach
the maximum exothermic temperature.</p><p num="0053">The third test conducted was a side impact test (GM9751P). Samples A-G
and I exhibited impact strengths in the range of from about 30 to about 60 in-lbs.
Combination H with no bi-functional molecule exhibited a low impact strength of
approximately 4 in-lbs.</p><p num="0054">The fourth test conducted was a cleavage test (ASTM3807). Substrates
that were difficult to bond were used in this test, namely Budd SMC #971N5 and
Cambridge SMC 252. Adhesives of the present invention exhibited strong adhesive
bonds when applied to these substrates. The test used the following terms: Maximum
Load (Ibf) represents the force needed to cause the adhesive bond to start failing.
Toughness (psi) is a measure of how much energy is needed to break the entire bond, and
generally is the integrated area under the bond strength curve. Propogation (pli) is the
amount of force needed to continue pulling the bond apart after the bond begins to break
apart. Failure Mode can be Adhesive Failure (AF), Cohesive Failure (CF) or Deep Fiber
Tear (DFT), a condition in which the adhesive is stronger than the substrate in which the
adhesive was applied.</p><p num="0055">As shown in Table II, adhesive sample H without the bifunctional
molecule exhibited poor results when compared to the adhesives containing the
bifunctional molecule (Samples A-G and I). </p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 2 - TABLE III</b></heading><p num="0056">As shown in Table III, adhesives of the present invention were formed using a sulfonyl chloride
polymerization system. The adhesive side of the adhesive was prepared by mixing together a
sulfonyl chloride containing compound, an elastomer, bi-functional molecule, monomer,
monomer cross-linker, oxidizing agent, additives (such as a wax and stabilizer), and an impact
modifier. The elastomer used in the present example was a 20 weight percent sample of
Neoprene AD-10, a polychloroprene (25% AD-10/MMA). Hypalon 30 (H30) was used as the
sulfonyl chloride-containing compound (commercially available from DuPont). The bi-functional
molecule used was AMPS 2404 (2-acrylamido-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid). BHT
(2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol) was used as a stabilizer. The monomer used was MMA (methyl
methacrylate). 10 weight percent of a monomer cross-linker, EGDMA (ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate) was mixed with the other components. In addition, 1 weight percent oxidizing
agent CHP (cumene hydroperoxide), 3 weight percent Boler 1977 paraffin wax (30%
1977/MMA), and 15-20 weight percent Paraloid BTA753 (impact modifier) was added to the
mixture.</p><p num="0057">The activator side of the adhesive was prepared by combining an epoxy-based
resin (ERL 4221 from Union Carbide Corp.) with a reducing agent (Reillcat™
ASY-2), which is an aldehyde amine condensation product. In addition, the activator
side contained a monomer, an impact modifier, and an additive (wax). The activator
portion was then mixed with the adhesive portion and allowed to cure. Two samples
(Control J and Sample K) were prepared, as illustrated in Table III. </p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 2 - TABLE IV</b></heading><p num="0058">The samples of Table III were analyzed for various physical properties,
the results of which are contained in Table IV. Control J contained no bifunctional
molecule and Sample K contained bifunctional molecule AMPS 2404. Similar tests were
conducted as described in Example 1. Sample K exhibited improved adhesive and
improved failure mode compared to Sample J on grit blasted steel. As shown in Table
IV, Sample K (with AMPS 2404 bifunctional molecule), when tested had higher impact
strength than Sample J with no bifunctional molecule.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 3 - TABLE V</b></heading><p num="0059">This example illustrates the effectiveness of adhesives of the present
invention at varying concentrations of bifunctional molecule and epoxy based
monomer/resins. As shown in Table V, adhesive samples L-T exhibited good heat
resistance and were effective at varying bi-functional molecule and epoxy based
monomer/resin concentrations. A GBS bond test was performed on these samples (16
hour @ RT, 2 hour at 150°C, 1"x1"x.03") and the results are contained in Table V.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 4 - TABLE VI</b></heading><p num="0060">This example illustrates the use of impact modifiers in adhesives of the
present invention. Adhesives containing an impact modifier and an elastomer (Samples
U-W) were prepared in a similar manner as the adhesive samples of Example I. Control
Sample X was based on previous technology (U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,243) containing no
impact modifier or elastomer. As shown in Table VI, Sample U-W exhibited improved
heat and impact resistance over Control X. <img id="img-00250001" orientation="unknown" wi="140" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00250001.tif" inline="no" he="217"/><img id="img-00260001" orientation="unknown" wi="142" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00260001.tif" inline="no" he="230"/><tables><table><tgroup cols="4"><tbody><row><entry nameend="4" namest="1"><b>Example 2 Table III -- Adhesives based on 1:1 sulfonyl chloride curing system</b></entry></row><row><entry nameend="2" align="center" namest="1"><b><u style="single">ADHESIVE</u></b></entry><entry align="center" namest="3"><b><u style="single">J CONTROL</u></b></entry><entry align="center" namest="4"><b><u style="single">K ― 15.96% 2404</u></b></entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b><u style="single">ADHESIVE SIDE</u></b></entry><entry align="center"><b><u style="single">CHEMICAL CLASS</u></b></entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>25% Neopene AD-10/MMA</b></entry><entry align="center">Elastomer</entry><entry align="center">20</entry><entry align="center">20</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>40% Hapalon H30/MMA</b></entry><entry align="center">Sulfonyl chloride</entry><entry align="center">25</entry><entry align="center">25</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>AMPS 2404</b> 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid</entry><entry align="center">Bifunctional molecule</entry><entry align="center">0</entry><entry align="center">15.96</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>BHT</b> 2, 6-Di-t-Butyl-p- Cresol Stabilizer</entry><entry align="right"/><entry align="center">1</entry><entry align="center">1</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>CHP</b> Cumene Hydroperoxide</entry><entry align="center">Oxidizing Agent</entry><entry align="center">1</entry><entry align="center">1</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>Paraloid BTA 753</b></entry><entry align="center">Impact modifier</entry><entry align="center">20</entry><entry align="center">20</entry></row> <row><entry align="center"><b>MMA</b> (Methyl methacrylate)</entry><entry align="center">Monomer</entry><entry align="center">20</entry><entry align="center">9.04</entry></row> <row><entry align="center"><b>30% Boler 1977/MMA</b> </entry> <entry align="center">Wax</entry><entry align="center">3</entry><entry align="center">3</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>EGDMA</b> Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate</entry><entry align="center">Monomer Cross Linker</entry><entry align="center">10</entry><entry align="center">10</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>ACTIVATOR SIDE</b></entry><entry align="center"><b>CHEMICAL CLASS</b></entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>25% Neopene AD-10/MMA</b></entry><entry align="center">Elastomer</entry><entry align="center">20</entry><entry align="center">20</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>Paraloid BTA 753</b></entry><entry align="center">Impact Modifier</entry><entry align="center">22</entry><entry align="center">22</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>Reillcat Asy2</b></entry><entry align="center">Di Hydropyridine</entry><entry align="center">2</entry><entry align="center">2</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>ERL 4221</b></entry><entry align="center">Epoxy</entry><entry align="center">16.03</entry><entry align="center">16.03</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>MMA</b> (Methyl methacrylate)</entry><entry align="center">Monomer</entry><entry align="center">36.97</entry><entry align="center">36.97</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>30% 1977/MMA</b></entry><entry align="center">Wax</entry><entry align="center">3</entry><entry align="center">3</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>Acid:Epoxy group mole ratio</b></entry><entry align="right"/><entry align="right"/><entry align="center">1:2</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><tables><table><tgroup cols="3"><tbody><row><entry nameend="3" namest="1"><b>Example 2 Table IV - Properties of Control J, Sample K of Table III</b></entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>ADHESIVE</b></entry><entry align="center">CONTROL J</entry><entry align="center">SAMPLE K</entry></row><row><entry align="center"><b>CURE EXOTHERM</b></entry></row><row><entry align="center">TIME TO MAX.
