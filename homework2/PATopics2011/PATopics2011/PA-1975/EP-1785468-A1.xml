load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="pa01">A process derived hydrogen donor solvent is used to increase the maximum resid conversion and conversion rate in a resid hydrocracker typically of the ebullated bed kind. The hydrogen donor solvent precursor is produced by hydroreforming reactions within the resid hydrocracker, recovered as the resin fraction from a solvent deasphalting unit, regenerated in a separate hydrotreater reactor, and recycled to the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker. The major advantage of this invention relative to earlier processes is that hydrogen is more efficiently transferred to the resin residual oil in the separate hydrotreater and the hydrogen donor solvent effectively retards the formation of coke precursors at higher ebullated bed resid hydrocracker operating temperatures and resid cracking rates.

The hydrogen donor solvent is produced by hydroreforming and cracking reactions within typically an ebullated bed resid hydrocracker, recovered as the resin fraction using a solvent deasphalting unit, regenerated in a separate hydrotreater reactor, and fed to the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker.</p><p num="p0009">According to the present invention there is provided a method for increasing the maximum resid conversion and resid conversion rate in a resid hydrocracker upgrader comprising the steps:
<ol><li>a) producing a hydrogen donor solvent precursor (i.e. a partially dehydrogenated solvent) in the resid hydrocracker, wherein the hydrogen donor solvent precursor is produced by hydroreforming reactions of a hydrogen donor solvent (feed);<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></li><li>b) directing the hydrogen donor solvent precursor to a solvent deasphalting unit, wherein a resin stream containing the hydrogen donor solvent precursor is formed;</li><li>c) directing the resin stream to a (separate) resid hydrotreater unit, wherein hydrogen donor solvent is (re)generated; and</li><li>d) directing the hydrogen donor solvent to the resid hydrocracker upgrader.</li></ol></p><p num="p0010">The invention also provides a method as claimed in claim 11.</p><p num="p0011">Hydrogen donor solvent precursor is typically also produced by the hydrocracking of the resid feed in the resid hydrocracker upgrader.</p><p num="p0012">A simplified reaction system may be useful to illustrate the hydrogen donor process concept and differentiate this invention from the prior art. For simplicity, this reaction system uses a phenanthrene hydrogen donor diluent precursor to illustrate the hydrogen donor process. However, this invention advantageously uses a much higher molecular weight, more complex, and higher boiling point resin hydrogen donor solvent. The hydrogen donor process typically starts by hydrogenating a hydrogen donor precursor solvent or diluent at moderate temperature and high pressure in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel-molybdate, to partially saturate the conjugated aromatic ring structure, which is represented by dihydrophenanthrene. The hydrogen donor solvent or diluent is mixed with the residual oil and fed to a resid hydrocracker upgrader. Hydrogen radicals (H) are produced by the hydrogen donor solvent or diluent to decrease the polymerization rate of the cracked products. Then, the spent hydrogen donor solvent is recovered<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><chemistry id="chem0001" num="0001"><img id="ib0001" orientation="unknown" wi="150" img-format="tif" img-content="chem" file="imgb0001.tif" inline="no" he="98"/></chemistry>
by distillation and deasphalting and is recycled to the hydrotreating step. The prior art exclusively uses distillation or the combination of reaction and distillation to produce a distillate process derived hydrogen donor diluent precursor. This invention uses solvent deasphalting to produce a non-distillable resin hydrogen donor solvent precursor.</p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p num="p0013">The method according to he invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying Figure, which is a schematic flow diagram of a plant for performing the method according to the invention.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="p0014">With reference to the Figure, a resid feed stream 1 is sent to a resid hydrocracker upgrader 2. The preferred operating conditions are highly dependent on the properties of the resid feed 1.

Distillates are preferably removed from the hydrocarbon resid source by conventional vacuum distillation. Preferably 95% of the components in the resid feed by weight have normal boiling points greater than 450°C, more preferably greater than 480°C, and more preferably about 520°C. Typically, an appropriate resid feed has a Conradson Carbon content greater than 10 weight %, a sulfur content in the order of or greater than 1 weight % sulfur, a vanadium and nickel content greater than 100 ppm, a heptane insoluble fraction greater than about 5 weight %, and a hydrogen to carbon atomic ratio of less than about 1.2 1, and a density greater than about 1.0 gm/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p num="p0015">The resid hydrocracker upgrader 2 converts the resid feed 1, recycle donor solvent feed 3 from a resid hydrotreater 14, and optional oil product feed 5 from a deasphalter 6 to a petroleum distillates product which is taken through line 7 and a cracked resid stream which flows into line 8. The resid hydrocracker upgrader 2 typically consists of a conventional ebullated bed hydrocracker (see <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="US4686028A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 4,686,028</text></patcit> for process details), an atmospheric distillation column, and a vacuum distillation column.</p><p num="p0016">The ebullated bed hydrocracker (resid hydrocracker upgrader 2) typically operates in a hydrogen partial pressure range between 50 and 210 bar and typically about 140 bar, a temperature range of 410 to 530°C and typically about 470°C, and a hydrogen donor solvent to resid feed weight ratio range of 0.1:1 to 1:1. The liquid reactant residence time is adjusted to provide a resid-to-distillate conversion between 30% and 90% and typically about 70%. The ebullated bed hydrocracker typically uses a conventional cobalt-molybdenum, nickel-molybdenum or nickel-cobalt-molybdenum on alumina catalyst in a spherical or extrudate form with a means to periodically replace a portion of the catalyst inventory with fresh catalyst during normal operations. In addition, a conventional colloidal molybdenum sulfide catalyst may be advantageously used. The preferred ebullated bed hydrocracker operating conditions are highly dependent on the source of the resid feed 1 and are best determined based on pilot plant tests. An ebullated bed hydrocracker typically operates with a temperature between 415 and 450°C, a hydrogen partial pressure 140 and 210 bar,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> a ratio of the hourly resid volumetric feed rate to reactor volume between 0.25:1 and 5:1, and a cobalt-molybdate or nickel-molybdate catalyst bed at between 5 and 30% volume expansion. The cracked resid product in line 8 is typically produced by first removing gas and distillate components in a distillation column operating at a pressure slightly greater than atmospheric pressure and then removing a majority of the remaining distillate components in a vacuum distillation to produce the upgraded distillate oil product stream that flows to line 7 and the cracked resid feed that flows via line 8 to deasphalter 6.</p><p num="p0017">The methods for the production of asphaltene, resin, and deasphalted oil products in a deasphalter are well established (<patcit id="pcit0024" dnum="US4686028A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patents 4,686,028</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0025" dnum="US4715946A" status="new"><text>4,715,946</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="US4810367A" status="new"><text>4,810,367</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0027" dnum="US5228978A" status="new"><text>5,228,978</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0028" dnum="US5914010A" status="new"><text>5,914,010</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0029" dnum="US5919355A" status="new"><text>5,919,355</text></patcit>; and <patcit id="pcit0030" dnum="US6106701A" status="new"><text>6,106,701</text></patcit>). The deasphalting process separates species in residual oil based on their solubility in paraffinic solvents. The effectiveness of the solvent in line 9 can be adjusted by either selecting the number of carbon atoms in the paraffinic solvent (usually between 3 and 5 carbons) or adjusting the solvent's temperature in relation to its critical temperature, or both.

Any number of deasphalter products can theoretically be produced by progressively decreasing the solvent's effectiveness and removing the separated phase. Both the deasphalter unit operation and laboratory heavy oil analytical methods use the sequential elution fractionation to separate heavy oil into fractions for analysis and products. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0001" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Klaus H. Altgelt and Mieczyslaw M. Boduszynski, "Composition and analysis of heavy petroleum fractions," Marcel Dekker, 1994, ISBN 0-8247-84946-6, page 63</text></nplcit>. A typical deasphalter unit is generally designed to produce two or three products. A two product deasphalter produces an asphaltene stream and deasphalted oil stream with the asphaltene stream having the lower solubility in the solvent. A three product deasphalter additionally produces a resin product with intermediate solubility between the oil and asphaltene products.</p><p num="p0018">The deasphalter operating conditions are adjusted to provide the desired asphaltene, resin, and oil properties. In the present invention, the asphaltene product yield should be minimized with the constraint that the asphaltene product passing through line 10 can be handled by the downstream processing unit, e.g., an asphaltene<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> gasifier 12 in the Figure. Oxygen is fed to the asphaltene gasifier 12 through line 15. Once the minimum practical asphaltene yield has been determined, a reasonable resin yield can be estimated based on the resin hydrogen to carbon ratio as a function of the resin yield. Analysis of laboratory scale sequential elution fractionations can be used to determine the effect of oil, resin, and asphaltene weight fraction yield on the oil, resin, and asphaltene product stream properties. The hydrogen donor solvent precursor should have a hydrogen to carbon atomic ratio that is preferably less than 1.5:1, more preferably less than 1.3:1, and most preferably less than 1.2:1. The deasphalter oil product in line 5 contains essentially the components in deasphalter feed 8 that do not enter either the asphaltene or resin products, which are fed to the asphaltene gasifier 12 and resid hydrotreater 11, respectively. The deasphalter oil product in line 5 may be recycled to the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker 2.</p><p num="p0019">However, this deasphalter oil product is a poor ebullated bed resid hydrocracker feedstock because it has a lower cracking rate than either resin or asphaltenes and is also is a relatively poor solvent for coke precursors. This material is therefore preferably fed to a fluid catalytic cracker or coker (not shown).</p><p num="p0020">The resin product of the solvent deasphalter that is sent to line 11 and a flow of hydrogen in line 13 are fed to a resid hydrotreater 14. The resid hydrotreater 14 may be a conventional trickle-bed, down-flow, ebullated bed, or entrained flow resid hydrotreating reactor. The trickle-bed and ebullated bed reactors would typically use a nickel-molybdenum on alumina catalyst with sufficient pore diameter to allow ready access of the resin feedstock. The entrained flow reactor would typically use a colloidal molybdenum sulfide catalyst. The ebullated bed reactor could also use a colloidal molybdenum sulfide catalyst in addition to the supported catalyst. The molecular hydrogen feed is generally between 250 and 500 Nm<sup>3</sup> H<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>3</sup> resin, and is fed to resid hydrotreater 14 via line 13. The resid hydrotreater 14 operating pressure is preferably greater than the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker upgrader 2 operating pressure to allow the hydrogen donor solvent and unreacted hydrogen to flow to the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker via line 3. The resid hydrotreater 14 generally<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> operates in the range of about 370° to 430°C, significantly lower than the 410° to 530° C typical operating temperature range for the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker. The resid hydrotreater 14 has a catalyst bed volume that is adjusted such that the hydrogen consumption is between 100 and 200 Nm<sup>3</sup> H<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>3</sup> resin.</p><p num="p0021">The method according to the invention offers a number of advantages relative to earlier processes. First, the resid hydrotreater is much more efficient than the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker because the catalyst deactivation rate due to metals and carbon deposition is much lower. The resid hydrotreater can operate at the optimum temperature for hydrogenation.</p><p num="p0022">Second, the hydrogen donor solvent significantly improves the performance of the ebullated bed resid hydrocracker. The maximum operable resid conversion in an ebullated bed resid hydrocracker tends to decrease with increasing reactor operating temperature, e.g., see <patcit id="pcit0031" dnum="US4427535A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 4,427,535</text></patcit>. Therefore, there is a decrease in reactor operability associated with an increase in the resid cracking rate. With hydrogen donor solvents and diluents, the hydrogen use efficiency and maximum operable resid conversion increases with increasing temperature e.g. see U.S Patents 4,698,147 and 4,002,556. The major advantage of a process derived resin hydrogen donor solvent relative to distillate hydrogen donor diluent is that a process derived resin hydrogen donor solvent provides the opportunity to significantly increase resid hydrocracker operability at high temperature without diluting the resid reactant with a distillate hydrogen donor diluent.</p><p num="p0023">Since asphaltenes in line 10 are not stable, it is desirable to promptly and usefully dispose of this troublesome material. Conventional pitch gasification for hydrogen production (see <patcit id="pcit0032" dnum="US4115246A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patents 4,115,246</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0033" dnum="US5958365A" status="new"><text>5,958,365</text></patcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0002" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Gasification by Christopher Higman and Maarten van der Bugrt-SBN 0-7506-7707-4</text></nplcit>) is the preferred asphaltene disposal method. The raw gas leaves the asphaltene gasifier through line 16 and enters the hydrogen production and purification unit 17. Hydrogen from the hydrogen production and purification unit leaves through line 18 where it may optionally connected with a supplemental hydrogen source 20 and is<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> available for use in the resid hydrotreater 14 through line 13 and the resid hydrocracker 2 through line 4. Waste gas from the hydrogen production and purification unit 17 leaves through line 19 where it can be disposed of or employed in an appropriate manner.</p><p num="p0024">While this invention has been described with respect to particular embodiments thereof, it is apparent that numerous other forms and modifications of the invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art.
