polynorbornene, and particularly to a ring-opened
polynorbornene low in birefringence, high in wavelength
dependency about birefringence and excellent in
transparency and heat resistance.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND ART</u></heading><p num="0002">Transparent resins have heretofore been used as
ordinary materials for automobile parts, lighting
equipments, electric parts, etc., of which transparency is
required, and have recently been being applied to,
particularly, optical materials that optical properties are
of great importance. Polycarbonate resins and acrylic
resins are known as transparent resins suitably used for
such application fields.</p><p num="0003">However, the acrylic resins involve problems in
points of heat resistance and water resistance (low water
absorption property) and the like though they are excellent
in transparency. On the other hand, the polycarbonate
resins involve such problems that birefringence is high
though they are superb in heat resistance and water
resistance to the acrylic resins. Therefore, as 
transparent resins for optical materials, attention has
been recently attracted to cycloolefin resins that have
good transparency, water resistance, low birefringence,
heat resistance and the like in combination and is supplied
to actual use.</p><p num="0004">As such cycloolefin reins, various resins have been
known and described in, for example, Patent Literature 1 to
Patent Literature 6.</p><p num="0005">With the high advancement of function and use of
optical instrument, however, these cycloolefin resins may
not sufficiently satisfy properties required of optical
materials in some cases. In optical materials used in
optical instrument having highly advanced functions in
particular, sufficiently low birefringence is extremely
important property. There is thus a demand for development
of a transparent resin having far excellent low
birefringence compared with the conventional transparent
resins.</p><p num="0006">On the other hand, attention is attracted to
cycloolefin resins as resin materials used in optical films.
Films formed of such a cycloolefin resin have been proposed
as various optical films.</p><p num="0007">Specifically, phase difference plates formed of a
film of a cycloolefin resin are described in Patent
Literature 7 to Patent Literature 10.</p><p num="0008">In Patent Literature 11 to Patent Literature 13, it
is described that a film of a cycloolefin resin is used as 
a protective film for a polarizing plate.</p><p num="0009">A substrate for a liquid crystal display device,
which is composed of a film of a cycloolefin resin, is
described in Patent Literature 14.</p><p num="0010">Since the optical films formed respectively of these
cycloolefin reins have property that the absolute value of
phase difference (birefringence) of transmitted light
becomes lower as the wavelength of the transmitted light
becomes longer, however, it is extremely difficult to give
a specific phase difference of, for example, a 1/4
wavelength to the transmitted light of all rays in a
visible region (400 to 800 nm). The same circumstances
apply to optical films formed respectively of other resins
in addition to the conventional cycloolefin resins.</p><p num="0011">As described above, in resins used in application
fields of which highly-advanced optical properties are
required, other than a fact that they have general optical
properties, the control of specific wavelength dependency
about birefringence that the birefringence of transmitted
light becomes higher as the wavelength of the transmitted
light becomes longer when a film is formed, and degree of
the birefringence become great problems.

Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg, B, Al, Si, Sn, Pb and the like, which

used in the ring-opening (co)polymerization reaction.</p><heading>[Ring-opening polymerization solvent]</heading><p num="0074">As specific examples of a solvent (solvent for
dissolving the monomers, metathesis catalyst and molecular

reaction, may be mentioned alkanes such as pentane, hexane,
heptane, octane, nonane and decane; cycloalkanes such as
cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane, decalin and
norbornane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene,
xylene, ethylbenzene and cumene; halogenated alkanes such
as chlorobutane, bromohexane, methylene chloride,
dichloroethane, hexamethylene dibromdie, chlorobenzene,
chloroform and tetrachloroethylene; aryl compounds;
saturated carboxylic acid esters such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl
acetate, isobutyl acetate, methyl propionate and
dimethoxyethane; and ethers such as dibutyl ether,
tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane. These solvents may be
used either singly or in any combination thereof. Among
these, the aromatic hydrocarbons are preferred.</p><p num="0075">The amount of the solvent used is such that a weight

ring-opening polymerization has the structural
unit (I) and structural unit (II), in which both X<sup>1</sup> in the
general formula (I) and X<sup>2</sup> in the general formula (II) are
vinylene groups. Such a polynorbornene may be used in
various application fields as it is. From the viewpoint of
heat stability, however, a part or the whole of the
vinylene groups in the ring-opened polymer are preferably
hydrogenated into ethylene groups to provide a hydrogenated
product. In such a hydrogenated product, the aromatic 
rings located at side chains based on Specific Monomers (I)
and (II) are preferably substantially not hydrogenated.</p><p num="0077">The hydrogenation rate of the vinylene groups is
preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%,
still more preferably at least 98%. Coloration or
deterioration by heat is more inhibited as the
hydrogenation rate is higher. It is hence preferable that
the hydrogenation rate be higher.</p><p num="0078">It is necessary to conduct the hydrogenation reaction
under conditions that the aromatic rings located at side
chains based on Specific Monomers (I) and (II) are
substantially not hydrogenated. In general, the
hydrogenation reaction is conducted by adding a
hydrogenation catalyst to a solution of the ring-opened
polymer and causing hydrogen gas of normal pressure to 300
atm, preferably 3 to 200 atm to act on the solution at 0 to
200°C, preferably 20 to 180°C.</p><p num="0079">As the hydrogenation catalyst, may be used that used
in an ordinary hydrogenation reaction of an olefinic
compound. As such a hydrogenation catalyst, may be used
either a heterogeneous catalyst or a homogenous catalyst.
As specific examples of the heterogeneous catalyst, may be
mentioned solid catalysts with a noble metal catalytic
substance such as palladium, platinum, nickel, rhodium or
ruthenium carried on a carrier such as carbon, silica,
alumina or titania. As specific examples of the homogenous
catalyst, may be mentioned nickel naphthenate/triethylaluminum, 
nickel acetylacetonate/triethylaluminum,
cobalt octanoate/n-butyllithium, titanocene dichloride/diethylaluminum
monochloride, rhodium acetate,
chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium, dichlorotris-(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium,
chlorohydrocarbonyltris-(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium
and dichlorocarbonyltris-(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium.
The form of the catalyst
may be either powder or particles.</p><p num="0080">In order to substantially prevent the aromatic rings
located at the side chains based on Specific Monomers (I)
and (II) from being hydrogenated, it is necessary to
control the amount of these hydrogenation catalysts.
However, the catalyst is generally used in a proportion
that a weight ratio of "the ring-opened polymer to "the
hydrogenation catalyst" amounts to 1:(1 x 10<sup>-6</sup>) to 1:2.</p><p num="0081">Since the ring-opened polynorbornenes according to
the present invention exhibit specific wavelength
