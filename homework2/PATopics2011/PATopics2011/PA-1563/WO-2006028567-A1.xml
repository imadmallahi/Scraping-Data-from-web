Field of the Invention</p> <p num="p0003">This invention relates to the protection of organic materials, such as rubber, plastic, lubricating oils, petroleum fuels, waxes, organic liquids, and the like, from oxidation by the use of antioxidants that are hydrazides and derivatives thereof.</p> <p num="p0004">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to lubricants, especially lubricating oils. More particularly, the invention relates to a class of dispersant additives having antioxidant and viscosity index improving credit that are preferably derived from an ethylene-propylene diene modified terpolymer (EPDM) or an ethylene-propylene copolymer and a hydrazide or hydrazide derivative. 2. Description of Related Art Organic materials such as rubber, plastic, lubricating oils, petroleum fuels, waxes, and organic liquids are well known to need protection from oxidation.</p><p num="p0005">Currently, many of these organic materials are being exposed to higher operating temperatures and mechanical shear. New stabilizers that can protect organic materials from premature oxidation and degradation under these advanced operating conditions are being sought.</p><p num="p0006">Further, in developing lubricating oils, there have been many attempts to provide additives that provide a lubricating oil with dispersancy of sludge and soot as well as high temperature deposit control In addition, the formulation of an oil to meet high and low temperature viscosity requirements is critical and, in most cases, a viscosity index improver 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
is employed to achieve this goal. Most multifunctional additives of the prior art provide one or two of these features.</p><p num="p0007">It is well-known that internal combustion engines operate under a wide range of temperatures, including low temperature stop-and-go driving service, as well as high- temperature conditions produced by continuous high speed driving. Stop-and-go driving, particularly under cold, damp weather conditions, leads to the formation of sludge in the crankcase and in the oil passages of a gasoline or a diesel engine. This sludge seriously limits the ability of the crankcase engine oil to lubricate the engine effectively. In addition, the sludge, with its entrapped water, tends to contribute to rust formation in the engine. These problems can be aggravated by engine manufacturers' lubrication service recommendations, which typically specify extended oil drain intervals.</p><p num="p0008">The polymers utilized in this invention can be obtained by a variety of methods known in the art. Such art can be represented by, but is not limited to, the following.</p><p num="p0009">U.S. Patent No. 3,928,497 discloses a process for preparing a graft-modified ethylene polymer or copolymer with a dicarboxylic acid graft-copolymerizable therewith or its graft- copolymerizable derivative in an alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of a radical initiator, characterized in that the reaction is performed while adding the dicarboxylic acid or its derivative gradually to the solvent in which the starting ethylene polymer or copolymer is present. U.S. Patent No. 4,517, 104 discloses oil soluble viscosity index improving ethylene copolymers, such as copolymers of ethylene and propylene; and ethylene, propylene and diolefin; etc., that are reacted or grafted with ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid moieties, preferably maleic anhydride moieties, and reacted with polyamines having two or 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
more primary amine groups and a carboxylic acid component, preferably alkylene polyamine and alkenyl succinic anhydride, such as polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride. Or the grafted ethylene copolymer can be reacted with already formed salts, amides, imides, etc. of the polyamine and acid component, preferably imides of alkylene polyamine and alkenyl succinic anhydride. It is said that these reactions can permit the incorporation of varnish inhibition and dispersancy into the ethylene copolymer while inhibiting cross-linking with resulting viscosity increase, haze or gelling. The grafting reaction may be carried out thermally, or more preferably with a free radical initiator, such as a peroxide in a mineral lubricating oil, in which case the acid component, preferably also acts to solubilize insoluble compounds formed by side reactions, such as maleic anhydride grafted oil molecules reacted with amine, to thereby inhibit haze formation, particularly when preparing oil concentrates of the V.I.-dispersant additive for later addition to lubricating oils Preferred methods of grafting maleic anhydride onto the ethylene copolymer by periodic or continuous addition of maleic anhydride and initiator charge, so as to maintain the maleic anhydride in solution during the grafting reaction are also disclosed</p><p num="p0010">U.S. Patent No 4,693,838 discloses the reaction of hydrocarbon polymers, such as ethylene copolymers, with unsaturated nitrogen-containing monomers or unsaturated carboxylic acids in a synthetic hydrocarbon lubricating oil in the presence of a free radical initiator, such as a peroxide The copolymer grafted directly with the nitrogen-containing monomers may be utilized as an additive for oil compositions, particularly lubricating oil compositions as a V.I.-dispersant additive. The polymer reacted with carboxylic acid may be further reacted with amines or amino-alcohols to also form a multifunctional V.I.-dispersant additive.

 U.S. Patent No. 4,340,689 discloses a process for grafting functional organic groups onto EPM and EPDM polymers wherein the grafting reaction is carried out in the cement in which the polymer is originally formed by solution polymerization.</p><p num="p0011">U.S. Patent No. 6, 162,768 discloses dispersants and dispersant viscosity index improvers which include polymers of conjugated dienes which have been hydrogenated, functionalized, optionally modified and post treated. The dispersant substances include a copolymer of two different conjugated dienes. The polymers are selectively hydrogenated to produce polymers which have highly controlled amounts of unsaturation, permitting highly selective functionalization. The polymers may be functionalized by grafting of heteroatom- containing olefins. Also provided are lubricant fluids, such as mineral and synthetic oils, which have been modified in their dispersancy and/or viscometric properties by means of the dispersant substances. Also provided are methods of modifying the dispersancy and/or viscometric properties of lubricating fluids such as mineral and synthetic lubricating oils. The dispersant substances may also include a carrier fluid to provide dispersant concentrates. U.S. Patent No. 6,677,282 discloses hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic compositions and derivatives thereof that are said to be useful as dispersant/viscosity improvers for lubricating oil and fuel compositions. Carboxylic compositions are derived from (A) a hydrocarbon polymer having M<sub>n</sub> ranging from about 20,000 to about 500,000, and (B) an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic compound prepared by reacting (1) an active methylene compound of a formula (I), and (2) a carbonyl compound of a general formula (II), and lower alkyl acetals, ketals, hemiacetals and hemiketals of the carbonyl compound (2). Carboxylic derivative compositions are obtained by reacting the carboxylic compositions with a reactant selected from the group consisting of (a) amines characterized by the presence within their

structure of at least one condensable H-- N&lt; group, (b) alcohols, (c) reactive metal or reactive metal compounds, and (d) a combination of two or more of any of (a) through (c), the components of (d) being reacted with the carboxylic composition simultaneously or sequentially, in any order. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0030033 discloses a composition comprising an N-aromatic substituted acid amide compound selected from the group consisting of compounds of a specified formula (I) These compositions may be used as such or they may be bound to a polymer backbone via a linking moiety In either case, they are useful as antioxidants, particularly in lubricating oil compositions WO 03/025034 discloses a process that comprises solution grafting a hydrocarbon polymer prepared from at least one C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>28</sub> polymerizable hydrocarbon, said polymer having a number average molecular weight in the range of from about 5,000 to about 500,000 with an ethylenically unsaturated C-, to C<sub>10</sub> carboxylic acid material, using a free radical initiator in the presence of a structurally defined ester oil Metal deactivators for polyolefins based on hydrazides are also known in the art, e.g.,</p><p num="p0012">Copper Deactivators For Polvolefw Insulation, Chan, M.

Next, an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid material is grafted onto the prescribed polymer backbone to form an acylated ethylene copolymer Those materials suitable for grafting onto the backbone contain at least one ethylenic bond and at least one, preferably two, carboxylic acid or its anhydride groups, or a polar group that is convertible into a carboxyl group by oxidation or hydrolysis. Preferably, the carboxylic acid reactants are selected from the group consisting of acrylic, methacrylic, cinnamic, crotonic, maleic, fumaric, and itaconic reactants More preferably, the carboxylic reactants are selected from the group consisting of maleic acid, fumaric acid, maleic anhydride, and mixtures thereof. Maleic anhydride or a derivative thereof is generally most preferred owing to its commercial availability and ease of reaction. Tn the case of unsaturated ethylene copolymers or terpolymers, itaconic acid or its anhydride is preferred owing to its reduced tendency to form a cross-linked structure during the free-radical grafting process. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="20"/>-->
 The ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid materials typically can provide one or two carboxylic groups per mole of reactant to the grafted polymer. For example, methyl methacrylate can provide one carboxylic group per molecule to the grafted polymer, while maleic anhydride can provide two.

 In the bulk process for forming the acylated olefin copolymers, one feeds the olefin copolymer to rubber or plastic processing equipment, such as an extruder or an intensive mixer or masticator, heats to a temperature of about 150° to about 400° C, and co-feeds the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid reagent and free-radical initiator to the molten polymer to effect grafting. Optionally, the reaction can be carried out using mixing conditions to effect shearing and grafting of the ethylene copolymers as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,075,383, incorporated herein by reference. The processing equipment is generally purged with nitrogen to prevent oxidation of the polymer and to aid in venting , unreacted reagents and byproducts of the grafting reaction The residence time in the processing equipment is sufficient to provide for the desired degree of acylation and to allow for purification of the acylated copolymer via venting.

 Other methods known in the art for effecting reaction of ethylene-olefin copolymers with ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic reagents, such as halogenation reactions, thermal, or "ene" reactions, or mixtures thereof, can be used instead of the free-radical grafting process. Such reactions are conveniently carried out in mineral oil or bulk by heating the reactants at temperatures of from about 250° to about 400° C under an inert atmosphere to avoid the generation of free radicals and oxidation byproducts. "Ene" reactions are a preferred method of grafting when the ethylene-olefin copolymer contains unsaturation. To achieve graft levels of from about 0.05 to about 0.4 carboxylic groups per 1000 M<sub>n</sub>, it may be necessary to follow or precede the "ene" or thermal graft reaction with a free radical graft reaction.</p><p num="p0060">The reaction between the carboxylic acid material bound to a substantially linear polymer, copolymer, or terpolymer and the compounds of the present invention is conducted by heating a solution of the polymer substrate under inert conditions and then adding the hydrazide compound to the heated solution, generally with mixing to effect the reaction. It is convenient to employ an oil solution of the polymer substrate heated to 100° to 175° C, while maintaining the solution under an inert atmosphere or a nitrogen blanket. The hydrazide compound is added to this solution and the reaction is effected under the noted conditions. The hydrazide compound can be added in one of two ways - neat or in a solution of suitable carrier solvent capable of delivering said compound into the reaction vessel, such as oil, toluene, or dinonyl phenol.

 As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,990,274, it is possible to reduce the bulk viscosity of a mixture of graft and derivatized polymer in mineral oil with the addition of a minor amount of co-solvent such as an ethoxylated alcohol, polypropylene glycol, or adipate diester. It has now been discovered that the addition of an alkyl phenol also has the benefit of reducing the bulk viscosity of the finished product. The co-solvent may be added prior to, with, or following the addition of the acid amide compound. In addition, this effect is evident regardless of what the derivatizing agent is. Examples of other derivatizing agents are polyamines, hydroxyamines, or polyols. Particularly useful polyamines are those having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and 2 to 5 nitrogen atoms in the molecule where only one nitrogen atom is a primary nitrogen atom and all the rest are tertiary nitrogen atoms or highly hindered secondary nitrogen atoms. The class of suitable polyamines includes: hydrocarbyl polyamines including alkyl, aryl and mixed alkaryl polyamines, which may contain additional groups, such as hydroxy, oxyamide and imidazoline groups, N-phenyl- phenylenediamine, N-amino alkyl imidazole, or N-amino alkyl morpholine. Useful hydroxyamines are those hydroxyamines having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, 1 to 4 hydroxy groups and 1 to 5 nitrogen atoms. Typical hydroxyamines include: diethanolamine, di- propanolamine, tris-hydroxymethyl amino-methane and 2-amino-2-ethyl- l ,3-propanediol.
