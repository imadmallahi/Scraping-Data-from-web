To test the melt strength and draw ratio at break, compounds were extruded in a Gottfert single screw laboratory extrusiometer (Diameter = 20 mm, UD = 20) equipped with a capillary die (L = 30 mm, D = 3 mm and an entrance angle of 90°). The throughput was kept at 10 g/min +/- 0.5 g/min for all the tests and was precisely measured for each experiment. Several measured materials were dry mixes of TPE pellets with some additional PP pellets. The extruded strands were always homogeneous, showing rapid mixing and good homogeneity and compatibility of the measured systems.</p><p num="p0058">The extruded polymer strand was drawn in uniaxial extension by a take-up device (Rheotens 71.97 apparatus). The distance between the die and the pulling system corresponded to a strand of Ls = 180 mm. The tensile force necessary for stretching the polymer was recorded as a function of the speed of the wheels of the Rheotens apparatus. The wheel velocity at zero pulling force (Vs) was recorded at the start of the measurement. The acceleration of the wheels of the Rheotens apparatus was kept constant at 2.4 mm/s<sup>2</sup>. The Melt Strength is the maximum tensile force reached, usually just before strand breakage. Melt strength curves were all measured at 180°C.

Experiments 11-13, compiled in Table 3, demonstrate the efficiency of the HMSL PP, used as component (i) to modify the Melt strength of various TPE systems significantly, even at low levels. As TPE in experiment 11 a blend was used of a 100 pbw KRATON MD-6933ES, 35 pbw Adstif HA722J and 150 pbw PRIMOL 352. The TPE component in experiment 12 was a mixture of 80 wt% the TPE blend from experiment 11 plus 20 wt% of HYTREL 4056. The TPE component in experiments 13 and 14* was a blend of 100 pbw KRATON G-1651 with 200 pbw of PRIMOL 352.</p><p num="p0075">The compositions 11-13 contained a very small amount of HMSL PP as component (i).

In this Example again blends have been used as TPE component. The blend used in Experiments 15* and 17 was made of 30 pbw KRATON MD-6933ES, 5 pbw KRATON G-1657, 17 pbw MOPLEN HP-1078 and 47 pbw PRIMOL 352. The TPE blend of Experiment 15* was used as such, to that in Experiment 17 1.5 wt% of HMSL PP was added. The composition of the blend used in experiment 16* contained 18 pbw MOPLEN and only 47 pbw PRIMOL. Using a slightly higher thermoplastic polyolefin component in the TPE blend, the overall content of thermoplastic polyolefin in Experiment 16* was therefore the same as that in Experiment 17. These compositions were then used for a foaming experiment.</p><p num="p0078">The foaming process was the following: the TPE was dry mixed with 2% of BIH40 and fed to the single screw extruder. The extruder temperature profile was: hopper/220°C/200°C/168°C/150°C/die. The extruder screw speed was set at either 50 rpm or at 80 rpm.</p><p num="p0079">It is clear from Table 4 that the addition of 1.3 wt% of HMSL PP (experiment 17) did not adversely affect the hardness or compression set values of the total composition, but did allow for a significant reduction in the density of a foamed article made thereof (at 50 rpm) and/or a significantly reduced water absorption (at 80 rpm) while keeping a foamed density below 600<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Low water absorption means most of the cells remained closed during the foaming stage due to the higher melt strength of TPE according to the invention.</p><p num="p0080">The composition of experiment 17 with its combination of low hardness, low compression set, and intrinsic properties upon foaming of low water absorption and low foam density, is clearly very suitable for applications like foamed sealing profiles used in the automotive industries.</p><p num="p0081"><tables id="tabl0004" num="0004"><table frame="all"><title><b>Table 4</b></title><tgroup cols="5" rowsep="1" colsep="1"><colspec
