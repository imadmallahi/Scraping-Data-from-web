In particular, this invention relates to compounds, particularly oligonucleotide compounds, which, in preferred embodiments, hybridize with nucleic acid molecules encoding HIFlo. and HIF2 . Such compounds are shown herein to modulate the expression of HIFl and HIF2α.</p><p num="p0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0005">Oxygen homeostasis is an essential cellular and systemic function; hypoxia leads to metabolic demise, but this must be balanced by the risk of oxidative damage to cellular lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins resulting from hyperoxia. As a result, cellular and systemic oxygen concentrations are tightly regulated via response pathways that affect the activity and expression of a multitude of cellular proteins. This balance is disrupted in heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Semenza, Genes Dev. , 2000, 14, 1983-1991) (Semenza, G., 2001, Trends Mol . Med. , 7, 345-350. Cells are typically cultured in the laboratory at an ambient oxygen concentration of 21%, but cells in the human body are exposed to much lower oxygen concentrations ranging from 16% in the lungs to less 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
than 6% in most other organs of the body- often significantly less in tumors. Semenza G., 2001, Trends Mol . Med. , 7, 345- 350.</p><p num="p0006">Solid tumor growth depends on a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients through neovascularization (angiogenesis) . Tumors often become &gt;hypoxic, often because new blood vessels are aberrant and have poor blood flow. Cancer cells make adaptive changes that allow them to proliferate even at hypoxia. These changes include an increase in glycolysis and an increase in production of angiogenic factors. Hypoxia in tumors is associated with resistance to radio-and chemotherapy, and thus is an indicator of poor survival.</p><p num="p0007">The transcriptional complex, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) , is a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis. Hypoxia induces the expression of genes participating in many cellular and physiological processes, including oxygen transport and iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, glycolysis and glucose uptake, transcription, metabolism, pH regulation, growth-factor signaling, response to stress and cell adhesion. These gene products participate in either increasing oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues or activating an alternative metabolic pathway (glycolysis) which does not require oxygen. Hypoxia-induced pathways, in addition to being required for normal cellular processes, can also aid tumor growth by allowing or aiding angiogenesis, immortalization, genetic instability, tissue invasion and metastasis (Harris, Na t . Rev. Cancer, 2002, 2, 38-47; Maxwell et al., Curr . Opin . Genet . Dev. , 2001, 11 , 293-299).</p><p num="p0008">HIF is a heterodimer composed of an alpha subunit complexed with a beta subunit, both of which are basic helix- loop-helix transcription factors. The beta subunit of HIF is a constitutive nuclear protein. The alpha subunit is the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
regulatory subunit specific to the oxygen response pathway, and can be one of three subunits, HIFl , 2 alpha or 3 alpha (HIF-lα, HIF-2 and HIF-3α, respectively) (Maxwell et al., Curr. Opin . Genet . Dev. , 2001, 11 , 293-299; Safran and Kaelin, J. Clin . Invest . , 2003, 111 , 779-783).</p><p num="p0009">The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays an essential role in homeostatic responses to hypoxia by binding to the DNA sequence 5' -TACGTGCT-3' and activating the transcription of dozens of genes in vivo under hypoxic conditions (Wang and Semenza, J. Biol . Chem . , 1995, 270, 1230-1237) . These gene products participate in either increasing oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues or activating an alternative metabolic pathway (glycolysis) which does not require oxygen. This list includes: aldolase C, enolase 1, glucose transporter 1, glucose transporter 3, glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase 1, hexokinase 2, insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), IGF binding protein 1, IGF binding protein 3, lactate dehydrogenase A, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase M, p21, transforming growth factor B3, ceruloplasmin, erythropoietin, transferrin, transferrin receptor, alb-adrenergic receptor, adrenomedullin, endothelin-1, heme oxygenase 1, nitric oxide synthase 2, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor FTL-1, and p35 (Semenza, Genes Dev. , 2000, 14, 1983-1991). Expression of HIFla is also sensitive to oxygen concentration: increased levels of protein are detected in cells exposed to 1% oxygen and these decay rapidly upon return of the cells to 20% oxygen (Wang et al . , Proc . Na tl . Acad. Sci . U. S . A . , 1995, 92, 5510-5514) .</p><p num="p0010">Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha is a heterodimer composed of a 120 kDa alpha subunit complexed with a 91 to 94 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
kDa beta subunit, both of which contain a basic helix-loop- helix (Wang and Semenza, J. Biol . Chem . , 1995, 270, 1230- 1237). The gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIFlα, also called HIF-1 alpha, HIF1A, HIF-1A, HIF1-A, and MOP1) was cloned in 1995 (Wang et al., Proc . Na tl . Acad. Sci . U. S . A. , 1995, 92, 5510-5514). A nucleic acid sequence encoding HIFlα is disclosed and claimed in US Patent 5,882,914, as are expression vectors expressing the recombinant DNA, and host cells containing said vectors (Semenza, 1999) .</p><p num="p0011">HIFlα expression and HIF-1 transcriptional activity are precisely regulated by cellular oxygen concentration. The beta subunit is a constitutive nuclear protein, while the alpha subunit is the regulatory subunit. HIFl mRNA is expressed at low levels in tissue culture cells, but it is markedly induced by hypoxia or ischemia in vivo (Yu et al., J. Clin . Invest . , 1999, 103, 691-696). HIFlα protein is negatively regulated in non-hypoxic cells by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Huang et al., Proc . Na tl . Acad. Sci . U. S . A. , 1998, 95, 7987-7992) . Under hypoxic conditions, the degradation pathway is inhibited, HIFl protein levels increase dramatically, and the fraction that is ubiquitinated decreases. HIFlα then translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with a beta subunit (Sutter et al., Proc . Na tl . Acad. Sci . U. S . A. , 2000, 97, 4748-4753).</p><p num="p0012">A natural antisense transcript that is complementary to the 3' untranslated region of HIFlα mRNA has been discovered and is named "aHIF" (Thrash-Bingham and Tartof, J. Na tl . Cancer Inst . , 1999, 91 , 143-151). This is the first case of overexpression of a natural antisense transcript exclusively associated with a specific human malignant disease. aHIF is specifically overexpressed in nonpapillary clear-cell renal carcinoma under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, but not 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
in papillary renal carcinoma. Although aHIF is not further induced by hypoxia in nonpapillary disease, it can be induced in lymphocytes where there is a concomitant decrease in HIFlα mRNA.</p><p num="p0013">HIFlα plays an important role in promoting tumor progression and is overexpressed in common human cancers, including breast, colon, lung, and prostate carcinoma. Overexpression of HIFs is sometimes observed in cancers, such as clear eel renal cell carcinoma, even at normoxia. Mutations that inactivate tumor suppressor genes or activate oncogenes have, as one of their consequences, upregulation of HIFl activity, either through an increase in HIFl protein expression, HIFlα transcriptional activity, or both (Semenza, Pedia tr. Res . , 2001, 49, 614-617).</p><p num="p0014">Until a tumor establishes a blood supply, the hypoxic conditions limit tumor growth. Subsequent increases in HIFl activity result in increased expression of target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) . VEGF expression is essential for vascularization and the establishment of angiogenesis in most solid tumors (Iyer et al., Genes Dev. , 1998, 12, 149-162) . A significant association between hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, VEGF overexpression and tumor grade is also seen in human glioblastoma multiforme, the highest grade glioma in which mean patient survival time is less than one year. The rapidly proliferating tumor outgrows its blood supply, resulting in extensive necrosis, and these regions express high levels of HIFl protein and VEGF mRNA, suggesting a response of the tumor to hypoxia (Zagzag et al., Cancer, 2000, 88, 2606-2618).</p><p num="p0015">The action of the von Hippel-Landau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene product is implicated in hypoxic gene regulation, in both normal and diseased cells. Individuals with VHL disease are predisposed to renal cysts, clear cell

renal carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma, haemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, angiomas of the retina, islet cell tumors of the pancreas, and endolymphatic sac tumors (Pugh and Ratcliffe, Semin . Cancer. Biol . , 2003, 13, 83-89). The VHL gene product participates in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by acting as the recognition component of the E3- ubiquitin ligase complex involved in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits (Cockman et al., J. Biol . Chem . , 2000, 275, 25733-25741; Ohh et al., Na t . Cell Biol . , 2000, 2, 423-427). In normal cells, VHL/HIF complexes form and target HIF alpha subunits for destruction (Maxwell et al., Na ture, 1999, 399, 271-275). This is proposed to occur through hydroxylation of the oxygen-dependent domain of HIF2α and subsequent recognition by the VHL gene product, as recognition of a homologous oxygen-dependent domain is the mechanism by which the VHL protein recognizes HIFlα (Maxwell et al., Na ture, 1999, 399, 271-275). HIF2α is in fact hydroxylated by the enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylases in vi tro (Hirsila et al., J. Biol .

HIFl may play a pivotal role in the Warburg effect in tumors, a paradoxical situation in which tumor cells growing under normoxic conditions show elevated glycolytic rates, which enhances tumor growth and expansion. HIFlα mediates the expression of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6- bisphosphatase-3, a gene whose protein product maintains levels of the key regulator of glycolytic flux, fructose-2, 6- bisphosphate (Minchenko et al., J.

Antisense therapy was shown to slow, but not eradicate, the growth of EL-4 tumors established in mice. In addition, endogenously expression of HIFl was almost completely inhibited in these tumors. When antisense therapy was combined with T-cell costimulator B7-1 immunotherapy, the tumors completely and rapidly regressed within 1 week.

Furthermore, when these tumor-free mice were rechallenged with EL-4 cells, no tumors emerged, indicating that systemic antitumor immunity had been achieved (Sun et al . , Gene Ther . , 2001, 8, 638-645) .</p><p num="p0021">Activation of HIFla is thought to aggravate heart failure by upregulation of cardiac ET-1, a gene product involved in heart failure and whose inhibition improves the survival rate of rats with heart failure. In a failing heart, a metabolic switch occurs, and HIFl activates the expression of glycolytic enzymes as compensation for impaired b-oxidation of fatty acid. Another consequence of increased HIFlα activity is that in rat cardiomyocytes, HIFl was shown to bind to the 5' -promoter region of the ET-1 gene and increase ET-1 expression. In vi tro, an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha . largely inhibited the increased gene expression of ET- 1, confirming the role of HIFlα in heart failure (Kakinuma et al., Circula tion , 2001, 103, 2387-2394).

Defective downregulation of HIFlα may play a major role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. For most of the first trimester, the human fetus develops under hypoxic conditions but at 10-12 weeks the intervillous space opens, the fetus is exposed to maternal blood and at this stage the trophoblast cells invade the maternal decidua. The switch of the trophoblasts from a proliferative to an invasive phenotype is controlled by cellular oxygen concentration. The proliferative, non-invasive trophoblast phenotype appears to be maintained by HIFlα mediated expression of TGFbeta3

because treatment of human villous explants with an antisense oligonucleotide against HIFl or TGF beta 3 induces invasion under hypoxic conditions. In this case the HIFlα antisense oligonucelotide was comprised of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, 16 nucleotides in length, and targeted to the AUG codon (Caniggia et al., J. Clin .

The ITF gene promoter bears a binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, and the function of HIFl as a transcription factor for ITF was confirmed in vi tro . T84 colonic epithelial cells were treated with a phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide, 15 nucleotides in length and targeted to the AUG codon of HIFl and this resulted in a loss of ITF hypoxia inducibility (Furuta et al., J.

Nickel transcriptionally activates plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, through the HIFlα signaling pathway.

HIFlα is ARNT2, a cerebral translocator homologous to hypoxia-inducible factor-1 beta. One splice variant of HIFlα found in rat neurons dimerizes with ARNT2 more avidly than it does with HIFlb, and the resulting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha-ARNT2 heterodimer does not recognize the HIFl binding site of the erythropoietin gene. This suggests that transcription of a different set of genes is controlled by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha-ARNT2 heterodimer controls in neurons under nonhypoxic conditions than the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha- HIFlα heterodimer controls under hypoxic conditions. This was evidenced by antisense oligonucleotide downregulation of HIFl expression in which the antisense oligonucleotide consisted of 16 phosphorothioate nucleotides targeted to bases 38 to 54 of the rat hypoxia-inducible factor-1 with GenBank accession number AF_057308 (Drutel et al., Eur.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a nuclear hormone-binding proteins that regulate transcriptional activities. Ligands which bind the PPAR- gamma isoform man amplify or inhibit the expression of inflammation-related gene products and may regulate the duration of inflammatory response. Hypoxia elicits a down- regulation of PPAR-gamma in intestinal epithelial cells which is effected through a binding site for HIFlα on the antisense strand of the PPAR-gamma gene. The expression of PPAR-gamma was upregulated in hypoxic cells when treated with an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to HIFlα identical to the one used in the preeclampsia study discussed above (Narravula and Colgan, J.

 The gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2α; also called HIF-2 alpha, endothelial PAS domain protein 1, EPAS1, MOP2, hypoxia-inducible factor 2, HIF- related factor, HRF, HIF1 alpha-like factor, HLF) was initially identified as a transcription factor expressed in endothelial cells (Ema et al., Proc .

Comparison of normal human tissues and cancers reveals that HIF2α protein is not detectable in normal tissue, but is easily visualized in malignant tissues (Talks et al., Am . J. Pa thol . , 2000, 157, 411-421). The requirement for expression of HIF2α in development is demonstrated by the abnormalities observed in HIF2α gene deficient mouse embyros, which include the disruption of catecholamine homeostasis and lack of protection against heart failure observed (Tian et al., Genes Dev. , 1998, 12, 3320-3324). Targeted disruption of the HIF2α gene and generation of embryos deficient for HIF2α is disclosed in the PCT publication WO 02/086497 (Compernolle et al., 2002).

protein levels, the abundance of the alpha subunits is markedly increased upon exposure of cells to hypoxia, primarily due to stabilization of the alpha subunit protein (Safran and Kaelin, J. Clin . Invest . , 2003, 111 , 779-783). HIF2α mRNA and protein is expressed at low levels in tissue culture cells, but protein expression is markedly induced by exposure to 1% oxygen, a hypoxic state (Wiesener et al., Blood, 1998, 92, 2260-2268) . The hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha/hypoxia-inducible factor 1 beta heterodimer protein binds to the hypoxic response element, which contains the core recognition sequence 5'-TACGTG-3' and is found in the cis-regulatory regions of hypoxia-regulated genes (Ema et al., Proc .

Inhibition of a dual specificity protein kinase that directly phosphorylates MAPK prevents HIF2α trans-activation during hypoxia (Conrad 1999; Conrad, 2001) . However, the inhibitor does not prevent HIF2α phosphorylation, thus, while the MAPK pathway regulates the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha, it does not directly phosphorylate the protein (Conrad et al., Comp .

Tumor cells experience hypoxia because blood circulates poorly through the aberrant blood vessel that tumors establish. Although hypoxia is toxic to cancer cells, they survive as a result of genetic and adaptive changes that allow them to thrive in a hypoxic environment. One such adaptation is an increase in the expression of the angiogenic growth factor named vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) . VEGF is a key angiogenic factor secreted by cancer cells, as well as normal cells, in response to hypoxia (Harris, Na t . Rev. Cancer, 2002, 2, 38-47; Maxwell et al., Curr. Opin . Genet .

primary target for rodent renal cell carcinoma (Liu et al . , Cancer Res . , 2003, 63, 2675-2680). Rat RCC cells lacking Tsc- 2 function exhibit stabilization of HIF2α protein and upregulation of VEGF, and were highly vascularized (Liu et al., Cancer Res . , 2003, 63, 2675-2680).</p><p num="p0033">A link between elevated HIF2α activity and angiogenesis has also been demonstrated by experiments that show how HIF activity regulates VEGF expression. Normal human kidney cells typically have low levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha, but upon introduction of a vector encoding HIF2α into these cells, VEGF mRNA and protein levels increase significantly (Xia et al . , Cancer, 2001, 91 , 1429-1436). When HIF2α was inhibited, VEGF expression was significantly decreased, thus demonstrating a direct link between HIF2α activity and VEGF expression (Xia et al., Cancer, 2001, 91 , 1429-1436) . Similarly, a dose-dependent increase in VEGF mRNA is observed when human umbulical vein cells are transduced with a virus encoding HIF2α (Maemura et al., J. Biol . Chem . , 1999, 274, 31565-31570). Expression of a mutated HIF2α that lacks a transactivation domain inhibits the induction of VEGF mRNA during hypoxia, a finding that further suggests that HIF2α is an important regulator of VEGF expression (Maemura et al., J. Biol . Chem . , 1999, 274, 31565- 31570) .</p><p num="p0034">A correlation between HIF activity and VEGF expression is also observed in malignant cells and tissues. HIF2α can be readily detected in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines in the absence of a vector encoding HIF2α (Xia et al., Cancer, 2001, 91 , 1429-1436) . Significant increases in HIF2α and VEGF mRNA in renal cell carcinoma tissue samples, compared to normal tissue, suggest that abnormal activation of HIF2α may be involved in the angiogenesis of RCC (Xia et al., Cancer, 2001, 91 , 1429-1436). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
 In addition to RCC, the expression of HIF2α in other malignancies has also been reported. HIF2α is expressed at the levels of mRNA and protein in human bladder cancers, especially in those with an invasive phenotype (Xia et al . , Urology, 2002, 59, 774-778) . Another example of overexpression of HIF2α is seen in squamous cell head-and- neck cancer (SCHNC) . Higher levels of HIF2α were associated with locally aggressive behavior of SCHNC, as well as intensification of angiogenesis (Koukourakis et al., Int . J. Radia t . Oncol . Biol . Phys . , 2002, 53, 1192-1202). These findings also demonstrated a link between overexpression of HIF2α and resistance to chemotherapy. Yet another correlation between overexpression of HIF2α and cancer is seen in malignant pheochromocytomas, which exhibit a higher level of HIF2α and an induced VEGF pathway, when compared to benign counterparts (Favier et al., Am . J. Pa thol . , 2002, 1 61 , 1235-1246). HIF2α overexpression is also a common event in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is related to the up-regulation of multiple angiogenic factors and overexpression of angiogenic receptors by cancer cells. HIF2α overexpression in NSCLC is an indicator of poor prognosis (Giatromanolaki et al., Br. J. Cancer, 2001, 85, 881-890) . Taken together, these studies demonstrate that elevated HIF2α confers aggressive tumor behavior, and that targeting the HIF pathway may aid the treatment of several different types of cancers.</p><p num="p0035">Overexpression of HIF2α has also been observed in several cancer cell lines in addition to RCC cell lines. Elevated levels of HIF2α mRNA and protein are seen in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, and exposure of these cells to hypoxia further increases HIF2α expression (Sato et al., Am . J. Respir . Cell Mol . Biol . , 2002, 26, 127-134). Furthermore, the hypoxia response element plays a role in constitutively

upregulating an isoform of VEGF in cancer cell lines under normoxic conditions. The HRE located within a cell type- specific enhancer element in glioblastoma cells participates in the up-regulation of VEGF expression through enhanced binding of HIF2α to the HRE (Liang et al., J. Biol . Chem . , 2002, 277, 20087-20094). A truncated version of HIF2α that can bind to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 beta, but not to the HRE, was unable to transactivate the VEGF promoter (Liang et al., J. Biol .

Overview of the Invention</p><p num="p0054">The present invention employs compounds, preferably oligonucleotides and similar species for use in modulating the function or effect of nucleic acid molecules encoding HIFl or HIF2α. This is accomplished by providing oligonucleotides which specifically hybridize with one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding HIFlα or HIF2α. Thus "target nucleic acid" refers to a nucleic acid molecule encoding HIFlα or HIF2α. As used herein, the term "nucleic acid molecule encoding HIFlα" has been used for convenience to encompass DNA encoding HIFlα, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA. Similarly, the term "nucleic acid molecule encoding HIF2α" has been used for convenience to encompass DNA encoding HIF2α, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA. The hybridization of a compound of this invention with its target nucleic acid is generally referred to as "antisense". Consequently, the preferred mechanism believed to be included in the practice of some preferred embodiments of the invention is referred to herein as "antisense inhibition." Such antisense inhibition is typically based upon hydrogen bonding-based hybridization of oligonucleotide strands or segments such that at least one strand or segment is cleaved, degraded, or otherwise rendered inoperable. In this regard, it is presently preferred to target specific nucleic acid molecules and their functions for such antisense inhibition.</p><p num="p0055">The functions of DNA to be interfered with can include replication and transcription.

The functions of RNA to be interfered with can include functions such as translocation of the RNA to a site of protein translation, translocation of the RNA to sites within the cell which are distant from the site of RNA synthesis, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more RNA species, and catalytic activity or complex formation involving the RNA which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA. One preferred result of such interference with target nucleic acid function is modulation of the expression of HIFlα or HIF2α. In the context of the present invention, "modulation" and "modulation of expression" mean either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease (inhibition) in the amount or levels of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the gene, e.g., DNA or RNA. Inhibition is often the preferred form of modulation of expression and mRNA is often a preferred target nucleic acid.</p><p num="p0056">In the context of this invention, "hybridization" means the pairing of complementary strands of oligomeric compounds. In the present invention, the preferred mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases) of the strands of oligomeric compounds. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances.</p><p num="p0057">An antisense compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="24"/>-->
complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vi tro assays.</p><p num="p0058">In the present invention the phrase "stringent hybridization conditions" or "stringent conditions" refers to conditions under which a compound of the invention will hybridize to its target sequence, but to a minimal number of other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances and in the context of this invention, "stringent conditions" under which oligomeric compounds hybridize to a target sequence are determined by the nature and composition of the oligomeric compounds and the assays in which they are being investigated.</p><p num="p0059">"Complementary, " as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleobases of an oligomeric compound. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an oligonucleotide (an oligomeric compound) , is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, said target nucleic acid being a DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be a complementary position. The oligonucleotide and the further DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of complementary positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, "specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of precise pairing or complementarity over 
<!-- EPO <DP n="25"/>-->
a sufficient number of nucleobases such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and a target nucleic acid.</p><p num="p0060">It is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense compound need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable. Moreover, an oligonucleotide may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure or hairpin structure) . It is preferred that the antisense compounds of the present invention comprise at least 70% sequence complementarity to a target region within the target nucleic acid, more preferably that they comprise 90% sequence complementarity and even more preferably comprise 95% sequence complementarity to the target region within the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. For example, an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleobases may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an antisense compound which is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope of the present invention. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the

Compounds of the Invention</p><p num="p0062">According to the present invention, compounds include antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers, probes, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid. As such, these compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges or loops. Once introduced to a system, the compounds of the invention may elicit the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect modification of the target nucleic acid. One non-limiting example of such an enzyme is RNAse H, a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA: DNA duplex. It is known in the art that single-stranded antisense compounds which are "DNA-like" elicit RNAse H. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. Similar roles have been postulated for other ribonucleases such as those in the RNase III and ribonuclease L family of enzymes .</p><p num="p0063">While the preferred form of antisense compound is a single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide, in many species the introduction of double-stranded structures, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, has been shown to induce potent and specific antisense-mediated reduction of the function of a gene or its associated gene products. This phenomenon occurs in both plants and animals and is believed 
<!-- EPO <DP n="27"/>-->
to have an evolutionary connection to viral defense and transposon silencing.</p><p num="p0064">The first evidence that dsRNA could lead to gene silencing in animals came in 1995 from work in the nematode, Caenorhabdi tis elegans (Guo and Kempheus, Cell, 1995, 81, 611-620). Montgomery et al . have shown that the primary interference effects of dsRNA are posttranscriptional (Montgomery et al., Proc . Na tl . Acad. Sci . USA, 1998, 95, 15502-15507). The posttranscriptional antisense mechanism defined in Caenorhabdi tis elegans resulting from exposure to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has since been designated RNA interference (RNAi) . This term has been generalized to mean antisense-mediated gene silencing involving the introduction of dsRNA leading to the sequence-specific reduction of endogenous targeted mRNA levels (Fire et al., Na ture, 1998, 391, 806-811) . Recently, it has been shown that it is, in fact, the single-stranded RNA oligomers of antisense polarity of the dsRNAs which are the potent inducers of RNAi (Tijsterman et al., Science, 2002, 295, 694-697).</p><p num="p0065">The oligonucleotides of the present invention also include variants in which a different base is present at one or more of the nucleotide positions in the oligonucleotide. For example, if the first nucleotide is an adenosine, variants may be produced which contain thymidine, guanosine or cytidine at this position. This may be done at any of the positions of the oligonucleotide. These oligonucleotides are then tested using the methods described herein to determine their ability to inhibit expression of HIF2α mRNA.</p><p num="p0066">In the context of this invention, the term "oligomeric compound" refers to a polymer or oligomer comprising a plurality of monomeric units. In the context of this invention, the term "oligonucleotide" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid 
<!-- EPO <DP n="28"/>-->
(DNA) or mimetics, chimeras, analogs and homologs thereof. This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent intemucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non- naturally occurring portions which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for a target nucleic acid and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.</p><p num="p0067">While oligonucleotides are a preferred form of the compounds of this invention, the present invention comprehends other families of compounds as well, including but not limited to oligonucleotide analogs and mimetics such as those described herein.</p><p num="p0068">The compounds in accordance with this invention preferably comprise from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases (i.e. from about 8 to about 80 linked nucleosides).

One having skill in the art armed with the preferred antisense compounds illustrated herein will be

able, without undue experimentation, to identify further preferred antisense compounds.</p><p num="p0073">C. Targets of the Invention</p><p num="p0074">"Targeting" an antisense compound to a particular nucleic acid molecule, in the context of this invention, can be a multistep process. The process usually begins with the identification of a target nucleic acid whose function is to be modulated. This target nucleic acid may be, for example, a cellular gene (or mRNA transcribed from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or disease state, or a nucleic acid molecule from an infectious agent. In the present invention, the target nucleic acid encodes HIFla or HIF2a.</p><p num="p0075">The targeting process usually also includes determination of at least one target region, segment, or site within the target nucleic acid for the antisense interaction to occur such that the desired effect, e.g., modulation of expression, will result. Within the context of the present invention, the term "region" is defined as a portion of the target nucleic acid having at least one identifiable structure, function, or characteristic. Within regions of target nucleic acids are segments. "Segments" are defined as smaller or sub-portions of regions within a target nucleic acid. "Sites," as used in the present invention, are defined as positions within a target nucleic acid.</p><p num="p0076">Since, as is known in the art, the translation initiation codon is typically 5 ' -AUG (in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5 ' -ATG in the corresponding DNA molecule), the translation initiation codon is also referred to as the "AUG codon," the "start codon" or the "AUG start codon". A minority of genes have a translation initiation codon having the RNA sequence 5'-GUG, 5 ' -UUG or 5*-CUG, and 5'-AUA, 5 ' -ACG 
<!-- EPO <DP n="31"/>-->
and 5 ' -CUG have been shown to function in vivo. Thus, the terms "translation initiation codon" and "start codon" can encompass many codon sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is typically methionine (in eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (in prokaryotes) . It is also known in the art that eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative start codons, any one of which may be preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a particular set of conditions. In the context of the invention, "start codon" and "translation initiation codon" refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an mRNA transcribed from a gene encoding HIFlα or HIF2α, regardless of the sequence (s) of such codons. It is also known in the art that a translation termination codon (or "stop codon") of a gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5'-UAA, 5 ' -UAG and 5 ' -UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences are 5 ' -TAA, 5 ' -TAG and 5' -TGA, respectively).</p><p num="p0077">The terms "start codon region" and "translation initiation codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5<sup>1</sup> or 3') from a translation initiation codon. Similarly, the terms "stop codon region" and "translation termination codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation termination codon. Consequently, the "start codon region" (or "translation initiation codon region") and the "stop codon region" (or "translation termination codon region") are all regions which may be targeted effectively with the antisense compounds of the present invention.</p><p num="p0078">The open reading frame (ORF) or "coding region, " which 
<!-- EPO <DP n="32"/>-->
is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively. Within the context of the present invention, a preferred region is the intragenic region encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of a gene.</p><p num="p0079">Other target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene), and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). The 5' cap site of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5 ' -most residue of the mRNA via a 5 ' -5 ' triphosphate linkage. The 5' cap region of an mRNA is considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap site. It is also preferred to target the 5' cap region.</p><p num="p0080">Although some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain one or more regions, known as "introns," which are excised from a transcript before it is translated. The remaining (and therefore translated) regions are known as "exons" and are spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence. Targeting splice sites, i.e., intron-exon junctions or exon-intron junctions, may also be particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="33"/>-->
particular splice product is implicated in disease. Aberrant fusion junctions due to rearrangements or deletions are also preferred target sites. mRNA transcripts produced via the process of splicing of two (or more) mRNAs from different gene sources are known as "fusion transcripts". It is also known that introns can be effectively targeted using antisense compounds targeted to, for example, DNA or pre- mRNA.</p><p num="p0081">It is also known in the art that alternative RNA transcripts can be produced from the same genomic region of DNA. These alternative transcripts are generally known as "variants". More specifically, "pre-mRNA variants" are transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA that differ from other transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA in either their start or stop position and contain both intronic and exonic sequence.</p><p num="p0082">Upon excision of one or more exon or intron regions, or portions thereof during splicing, pre-mRNA variants produce smaller "mRNA variants". Consequently, mRNA variants are processed pre-mRNA variants and each unique pre-mRNA variant must always produce a unique mRNA variant as a result of splicing. These mRNA variants are also known as "alternative splice variants". If no splicing of the pre-mRNA variant occurs then the pre-mRNA variant is identical to the mRNA variant .</p><p num="p0083">It is also known in the art that variants can be produced through the use of alternative signals to start or stop transcription and that pre-mRNAs and mRNAs can possess more that one start codon or stop codon. Variants that originate from a pre-mRNA or mRNA that use alternative start codons are known as "alternative start variants" of that pre- mRNA or mRNA. Those transcripts that use an alternative stop codon are known as "alternative stop variants" of that pre- 
<!-- EPO <DP n="34"/>-->
mRNA or mRNA. One specific type of alternative stop variant is the "polyA variant" in which the multiple transcripts produced result from the alternative selection of one of the "polyA stop signals" by the transcription machinery, thereby producing transcripts that terminate at unique polyA sites. Within the context of the invention, the types of variants described herein are also preferred target nucleic acids.</p><p num="p0084">The locations on the target nucleic acid to which the preferred antisense compounds hybridize are hereinbelow referred to as "preferred target segments." As used herein the term "preferred target segment" is defined as at least an 8-nucleobase portion of a target region to which an active antisense compound is targeted. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently believed that these target segments represent portions of the target nucleic acid which are accessible for hybridization.</p><p num="p0085">While the specific sequences of certain preferred target segments are set forth herein, one of skill in the art will recognize that these serve to illustrate and describe particular embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Additional preferred target segments may be identified by one having ordinary skill.</p><p num="p0086">Target segments 8-80 nucleobases in length comprising a stretch of at least eight (8) consecutive nucleobases selected from within the illustrative preferred target segments are considered to be suitable for targeting as well.</p><p num="p0087">Target segments can include DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 5'- terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target segments (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately upstream of the 5'- terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 8 to about 80 nucleobases) . Similarly 
<!-- EPO <DP n="35"/>-->
preferred target segments are represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 3' -terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target segments (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately downstream of the 3' -terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 8 to about 80 nucleobases) . One having skill in the art armed with the preferred target segments illustrated herein will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify further preferred target segments.</p><p num="p0088">Once one or more target regions, segments or sites have been identified, antisense compounds are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect.</p><p num="p0089">D . Screening and Target Validation</p><p num="p0090">In a further embodiment, the "preferred target segments" identified herein may be employed in a screen for additional compounds that modulate the expression of HIFl or HIF2α. "Modulators" are those compounds that decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding HIFlα or HIF2α and which comprise at least an 8-nucleobase portion which is complementary to a preferred target segment. The screening method comprises the steps of contacting a preferred target segment of a nucleic acid molecule encoding HIFlα or HIF2α with one or more candidate modulators, and selecting for one or more candidate modulators which decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding HIFl or HIF2α. Once it is shown that the candidate modulator or modulators are capable of modulating (e.g. either decreasing or increasing) the expression of a nucleic 
<!-- EPO <DP n="36"/>-->
acid molecule encoding HIFl or HIF2α, the modulator may then be employed in further investigative studies of the function of HIFlα or HIF2α, or for use as a research, diagnostic, or therapeutic agent in accordance with the present invention.</p><p num="p0091">The preferred target segments of the present invention may be also be combined with their respective complementary antisense compounds of the present invention to form stabilized double-stranded (duplexed) oligonucleotides.</p><p num="p0092">Such double stranded oligonucleotide moieties have been shown in the art to modulate target expression and regulate translation as well as RNA processsing via an antisense mechanism. Moreover, the double-stranded moieties may be subject to chemical modifications (Fire et al . , Na ture, 1998, 391 , 806-811; Timmons and Fire, Na ture 1998, 395, 854; Timmons et al . , Gene, 2001, 263, 103-112; Tabara et al., Science, 1998, 282, 430-431; Montgomery et al., Proc .

For example, such double-stranded moieties have been shown to inhibit the target by the classical hybridization of antisense strand of the duplex to the target, thereby triggering enzymatic degradation of the target (Tijsterman et al., Science, 2002, 295, 694-697).</p><p num="p0093">The compounds of the present invention can also be applied in the areas of drug discovery and target validation.

Modifications</p><p num="p0105">As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base. The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are the purines and the pyrimidines. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. In turn, the respective ends of this 
<!-- EPO <DP n="41"/>-->
linear polymeric compound can be further joined to form a circular compound, however, linear compounds are generally preferred. In addition, linear compounds may have internal nucleobase complementarity and may therefore fold in a manner as to produce a fully or partially double-stranded compound. Within oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the intemucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide. The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage.</p><p num="p0106">Modified Intemucleoside Linkages (Backbones)</p><p num="p0107">Specific examples of preferred antisense compounds useful in this invention include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural inte ucleoside linkages.

"Chimeric" antisense compounds or "chimeras," in the context of this invention, are antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of an oligonucleotide compound. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, increased stability and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA: DNA or RNA: RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNAse H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA: DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. The cleavage of RNA: RNA hybrids can, in like fashion, be accomplished through the actions of endoribonucleases, such as RNAseL which cleaves both cellular and viral RNA. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.

Example 3 RNA Synthesis</p><p num="p0173">In general, RNA synthesis chemistry is based on the selective incorporation of various protecting groups at strategic intermediary reactions. Although one of ordinary skill in the art will understand the use of protecting groups in organic synthesis, a useful class of protecting groups includes silyl ethers. In particular bulky silyl ethers are used to protect the 5 ' -hydroxyl in combination with an acid- labile orthoester protecting group on the 2 ' -hydroxyl . This set of protecting groups is then used with standard solid- phase synthesis technology. It is important to lastly remove the acid labile orthoester protecting group after all other synthetic steps. Moreover, the early use of the silyl protecting groups during synthesis ensures facile removal when desired, without undesired deprotection of 2' hydroxyl.</p><p num="p0174">Following this procedure for the sequential protection of the 5 ' -hydroxyl in combination with protection of the 2'- hydroxyl by protecting groups that are differentially removed and are differentially chemically labile, RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized.</p><p num="p0175">RNA oligonucleotides are synthesized in a stepwise fashion. Each nucleotide is added sequentially (3'- to 5'- direction) to a solid support-bound oligonucleotide. The first nucleoside at the 3 '-end of the chain is covalently attached to a solid support. The nucleotide precursor, a ribonucleoside phosphoramidite, and activator are added, coupling the second base onto the 5 ' -end of the first nucleoside. The support is washed and any unreacted 5'- hydroxyl groups are capped with acetic anhydride to yield 5'- acetyl moieties. The linkage is then oxidized to the more stable and ultimately desired P (V) linkage. At the end of the nucleotide addition cycle, the 5 '-silyl group is cleaved 
<!-- EPO <DP n="66"/>-->
with fluoride. The cycle is repeated for each subsequent nucleotide .</p><p num="p0176">Following synthesis, the methyl protecting groups on the phosphates are cleaved in 30 minutes utilizing 1 M disodium- 2-carbamoyl-2-cyanoethylene-l, 1-dithiolate trihydrate (S<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>) in DMF. The deprotection solution is washed from the solid support-bound oligonucleotide using water. The support is then treated with 40% methylamine in water for 10 minutes at 55 °C. This releases the RNA oligonucleotides into solution, deprotects the exocyclic amines, and modifies the 2'- groups. The oligonucleotides can be analyzed by anion exchange HPLC at this stage.</p><p num="p0177">The 2 ' -orthoester groups are the last protecting groups to be removed. The ethylene glycol monoacetate orthoester protecting group developed by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) , is one example of a useful orthoester protecting group which, has the following important properties. It is stable to the conditions of nucleoside phosphoramidite synthesis and oligonucleotide synthesis. However, after oligonucleotide synthesis the oligonucleotide is treated with methylamine which not only cleaves the oligonucleotide from the solid support but also removes the acetyl groups from the orthoesters. The resulting 2-ethyl- hydroxyl substituents on the orthoester are less electron withdrawing than the acetylated precursor. As a result, the modified orthoester becomes more labile to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Specifically, the rate of cleavage is approximately 10 times faster after the acetyl groups are removed. Therefore, this orthoester possesses sufficient stability in order to be compatible with oligonucleotide synthesis and yet, when subsequently modified, permits deprotection to be carried out under relatively mild aqueous

As opposed to standard PCR in which amplification products are quantitated after the PCR is completed, products in real-time quantitative PCR are quantitated as they accumulate. This is accomplished by including in the PCR reaction an oligonucleotide probe that anneals specifically between the forward and reverse PCR primers, and contains two fluorescent dyes. A reporter dye (e.g., FAM or JOE, obtained from either PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, CA or Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) is attached to the 5' end of the probe and a

When the probe and dyes are intact, reporter dye emission is quenched by the proximity of the 3' quencher dye. During amplification, annealing of the probe to the target sequence creates a substrate that can be cleaved by the 5 ' -exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase. During the extension phase of the PCR amplification cycle, cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase releases the reporter dye from the remainder of the probe (and hence from the quencher moiety) and a sequence-specific fluorescent signal is generated. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, and the fluorescence intensity is monitored at regular intervals by laser optics built into the ABI PRISM™ Sequence Detection System.

It is believed that antisense inhibitors of HIF2α and possibly HIFl will be useful in treatment of angiogenic conditions, because of their effect on endothelial tube formation in an in vitro model for angiogenesis (see previous examples) .</p><p num="p0428">A pig model of ocular neovascularization, the branch retinal vein occlusion (BVO) model, is used to study ocular neovascularization. Male farm pigs (8-10 kg) are subjected to branch retinal vein occlusions (BVO) by laser treatment in both eyes. The extent of BVO is determined by indirect opthalmoscopy after a 2 week period. Intravitreous injections (10 ξ£M) of ISIS 129688 (unrelated control), ISIS 175510 (HIFlα) , ISIS 222035 (HIF2α) or ISIS 298697 (HIFlα with some crossreactivity to HIF2α) are started on the day of BVO induction and are repeated at weeks 2,6, and 10 after BVO (Right eye--vehicle, Left eye--antisense molecule) . Stereo fundus photography and fluorescein angiography are performed at baseline BVO and at weeks 1,6 and 12 following intravitreous injections to measure the neovascular response. In addition capillary gel electrophoresis analysis of the eye sections containing sclera, choroid, and the retina are performed to determine antisense concentrations, and gross and microscopic evaluations are performed to determine eye histopathology .
