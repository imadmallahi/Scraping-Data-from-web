Hydrofluoroalkanes such as 1,1,1,3,3-Pentafluoropropane and 1,1,1,3,3- pentafluorobutane may be used as replacements for (hydro)chlorofluoroalkanes, for example as blowing agents, as refrigerants or as solvents.</p><p num="p0003">These hydrofluoroalkanes are typically manufactured by reacting a chloro or chlorofluoro precursor with hydrogen fluoride. The crude hydrofluoroalkanes obtained in this reaction often contain impurities such as unconverted reagents, hydrogen chloride and olefinic impurities, in particular chlorofluoro olefins containing 3 or 4 carbon atoms.</p><p num="p0004">Patent application WO-A-00/14040 describes a process for purifying 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane. According to this known process, it is possible to reduce the fluorotrichloroethylene content in 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane by ionic chlorination in the presence of FeCl<sub>3</sub>, by hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/Rh on active charcoal or, in particular, by reaction with fluorine.</p><p num="p0005">Patent application WO-A-97/37955 describes a process for purifying 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane of l-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene, in which a photochlorination initiated with UV light of wavelength from 300 to 400 nm is carried out.</p><p num="p0006">The Applicant has now found that hydrofluoroalkenes - that is to say olefins consisting solely of carbon, hydrogen and fluorine - are particularly difficult to remove when they are present as impurity in a hydrofluoroalkane, in particular those comprising from 3 to 5 carbon atoms, most particularly those corresponding to the empirical formula C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>F , present as impurity in particular in 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane. On account of the very low chemical reactivity observed, the removal by means of a chemical treatment of the hydrofluoroalkenes in hydrofluoroalkanes is liable to require prolonged treatment times that are undesirable in an industrial process for manufacturing hydrofluoroalkane. In an extreme case, it would not be possible to go below a certain hydrofluoroalkene content.</p><p num="p0007">None of the prior art documents addresses this specific problem.

Preferably, the hydrofluoroalkane comprises 3 or 4 carbon atoms. The process has been found to be particularly effective for purifying 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane or 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane, and most particularly the latter. 5 It has been found surprisingly that the process according to the invention allows an effective reduction of the content of organic impurities in the hydrofluoroalkane. In particular, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane and 1,1,1,3,3- pentafluoropropane have physical and chemical stability under the conditions of the process according to the invention. The process according to the invention</p><p num="p0017">30 may be carried out easily.</p><p num="p0018">The organic impurities whose content may be reduced by means of the process according to the invention generally comprise 3 or 4 carbon atoms.

 The process according to the invention is particularly suitable for effectively removing hydrofluoroalkenes as described above. The process according to the invention, which may be carried out easily, allows an effective reduction of the content of olefinic impurities present in 1,1,1,3,3- pentafluoropropane or 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane.</p><p num="p0020">In a first aspect of the process according to the invention, the hydrofluoroalkane containing olefinic impurities, in particular hydrofluoroalkenes comprising from 3 to 5 carbon atoms, is subjected to a treatment with chlorine in the presence of an initiator. The treatment with chlorine serves to chlorinate the olefinic impurities in the hydrofluoroalkane containing olefinic impurities. These are notably (chloro)fluoro olefins containing 3 or 4 carbon atoms or, in particular, the hydrofluoroalkenes mentioned above.</p><p num="p0021">The initiator serves to decompose the chlorine molecules by cleavage. In a first variant of the first aspect of the process according to the invention, the the initiator is a free-radical initiator selected from an organic or inorganic initiator compound.</p><p num="p0022">To promote the mixing of the hydrofluoroalkane containing olefinic ■ impurities with the initiator compound, the first variant of the first aspect of the process according to the invention is preferably carried out in the liquid phase. According to the invention, the free-radical initiator is often an organic compound. Among the organic compounds that are usually used are peroxide or diazo compounds. Peroxide compounds are used in particular. Among these, the ones chosen more particularly are diacyl peroxides, peroxydicarbonates, alkyl peresters, peracetals, ketone peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides and dialkyl peroxides. Diacyl peroxides or peroxydicarbonates are preferably selected. Excellent results have been obtained with dilauroyl peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide or dicetyl peroxydicarbonate.</p><p num="p0023">The free-radical initiator may also be an inorganic compound. In this case, it is often chosen from hydrogen peroxide, percarbonates such as, in particular, sodium percarbonate, and perborates such as sodium perborate.</p><p num="p0024">The initiator compound is preferably selected from compounds with a half-life from 0.1 to 3 hours and usually of about 1 hour at the temperature of the treatment with chlorine. The initiator compound is generally used in a proportion of at least about</p><p num="p0025">10 ppm by weight relative to the hydrofluoroalkane containing olefinic impurities. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
At least about 20 ppm by weight of initiator compound are used. Even more particularly at least about 30 ppm by weight in particular. Most frequently, not more than about 10 000 ppm by weight of initiator compound are used relative to the hydrofluoroalkane containing olefinic impurities. Preferably, the amount of organic initiator compound does not exceed about 1 000 ppm by weight and even more preferably it does not exceed about 300 ppm by weight.</p><p num="p0026">In the first variant of the first aspect of the process according to the invention, the chlorine may be used in the gas phase or in the liquid phase. It is introduced in excess amounts relative to all of the olefinic impurities to be chlorinated in the hydrofluoroalkane containing olefinic impurities. Generally, the chlorine is used in a proportion of more than 3 mol per mole of olefinic impurities and preferably at least about 4 mol per mole of olefinic impurities. Generally, it is not desirable to exceed about 40 mol of chlorine per mole of olefinic impurities. It is preferable to limit the amount used so that virtually all of the chlorine can react and is not found in unchanged form after the present purification treatment. Preferably, the amount does not exceed about 15 mol per mole of olefinic impurities and even more preferably this ratio does not exceed about 12.</p><p num="p0027">In the first variant of the first aspect of the process according to the invention, the treatment with chlorine may be carried out over a wide temperature range. In particular, the treatment with chlorine is carried out at a temperature of at least about 40°C and even more particularly of at least about 60°C. Higher temperatures allow a faster conversion of the unsaturated compounds. However, this results in a correlative increase in pressure, of which account needs to be taken. Preferably, the treatment temperature does not exceed about 150°C and even more preferably it does not exceed about 100°C. Excellent results have been obtained when the treatment with chlorine is carried out in the regions of 60 to 100°C.</p><p num="p0028">In the first variant of the first aspect of the process according to the invention, the treatment with chlorine may be carried out at the autogenous pressure or a higher pressure generated, for example, by introducing an inert gas. In general, the treatment is carried out at a pressure which does not exceed about 5 MPa and preferably 2 MPa. Pressures from about 0.2 to about 1.0 MPa are suitable for use.</p><p num="p0029">These correlated conditions of high temperature and high pressure which are allowed for the treatment with chlorine contribute towards the fast and effective removal of the olefinic impurities. In the first variant of the first aspect 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
of the process according to the invention, the duration of the treatment with chlorine may be from about 1 to about 120 minutes.

The solid adsorbent may also be regenerated by a treatment with oxygen.</p><p num="p0097">In a sixth aspect of the process according to the invention, the purification treatment is a reaction with a compound containing oxygen. It has been found that reagents containing oxygen react preferentially with the organic impurities present in the hydrofluoroalkane, in particular in 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane and essentially without degrading the hydrofluoroalkane, in particular 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane. The compound containing oxygen may be, for example, an oxygenated gas, an oxygenated acid, an organic or inorganic peroxide, a peroxide salt or a peracid. Specific examples of such compounds are chosen from oxygen, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, potassium permanganate, sulphuric acid and sulphur trioxide.</p><p num="p0098">In another embodiment of the sixth aspect of the process according to the invention, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base and the compound containing oxygen is an alcohol. The base may be, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The alcohol may be chosen, for example, from methanol, ethanol and isopropanol.</p><p num="p0099">The reaction with the compound containing oxygen may be carried out in the presence or in the absence of an oxygenation catalyst. Oxygenation catalysts which may be used may be chosen, for example, from compounds and in particular from complexes containing platinum, manganese or titanium.</p><p num="p0100">The reaction with the compound containing oxygen may be carried out in the gas phase or in the liquid phase. It is preferably carried out in the liquid phase. In this case, the reaction temperature is generally not more than 150°C.<sub>.</sub>The temperature is more frequently not more than 120°C. Preferably, the temperature ' is not more than 100°C. The reaction temperature is generally at least -20°C. The

temperature is more frequently at least 0°C. Preferably, the temperature is at least 20°C.</p><p num="p0101">The reaction pressure is generally from 1 to 10 bar. In a seventh aspect of the process according to the invention, the purification treatment is a reaction in the gas phase with a reagent capable of reacting with at least some of the organic impurities, with the exception of a reaction with elemental chlorine.</p><p num="p0102">In the seventh aspect of the process according to the invention, the reagent may in principle be any reagent capable of reacting in the gas phase with at least some of the organic impurities present in the hydrofluoroalkane and in particular with the olefinic impurities. The reagent is advantageously chosen from hydrogen chloride, hydrogen, hydrogen fluoride, oxygen and ozone.</p><p num="p0103">In a typical example, the reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation. It has been found, surprisingly, that catalytic hydrogenation makes it possible to reduce the content of any impurity in particular in 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane to a level close to, even less than, 5 mg/kg, while at the same time avoiding degradation of the hydrofluoroalkane, in particular of 1,1,1,3,3- pentafluorobutane.</p><p num="p0104">Catalysts which may be used in the catalytic hydrogenation reaction in the gas phase according to the invention are, for example, catalysts containing a metal from group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements (IUPAC, 1970) or a mixture of several metals, preferably supported on a support such as active charcoal, a fluorinated alumina or aluminium trifluoride. Specific examples of metals from group VIII are platinum, palladium and rhodium. Among these catalysts, a catalyst comprising palladium is preferred.</p><p num="p0105">The metal content in the supported catalysts which may be used is generally at least 0.001% by weight. This content is usually at least 0.1% by weight. The metal content in the supported catalysts is generally not more than 20% by weight. This content is frequently not more than 10% by weight. A catalyst which is resistant with respect to the products which may be present during the catalytic hydrogenation, in particular hydrogen fluoride, is preferably chosen. Good results are obtained, for example, with a catalyst comprising palladium supported on active charcoal.</p><p num="p0106">The molar ratio between the reagent and the organic impurities present in the hydrofluoroalkane is generally at least 1 mol/mol. Preferably, the process is performed with a molar ratio of at least 1.5 mol/mol. The molar ratio between the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="20"/>-->
reagent and the organic impurities generally does not exceed 1000 mol/mol. It is preferable for this molar ratio not to exceed 10 mol/mol. In the seventh aspect of the process according to the invention, a molar ratio between the reagent and the olefinic impurities of not more than 3 is frequently maintained. However, when the reagent is hydrogen, good results are also obtained when a molar ratio between the hydrogen and the olefinic impurities of greater than or equal to 5 is maintained. The molar ratio between the hydrogen and the olefinic impurities is advantageously less than or equal to 20. Preferably, this ratio is less than or equal to 10. The temperature of the gas-phase reaction is generally at least 50°C. This temperature is usually at least 70°C. Preferably, this temperature is greater than or equal to 100°C. Generally, the temperature of the gas-phase reaction is not more than 400°C. Preferably, this temperature is not more than 300°C. In a particularly preferred manner, this temperature is not more than 250°C. Even more preferably, this temperature is not more than 150°C.</p><p num="p0107">In the seventh aspect of the process according to the invention, it is often necessary to carry out an operation intended to place the hydrofluoroalkane containing the organic impurities into the gaseous form. This operation may comprise, for example, an evaporation. In one preferred variant, the operation comprises the removal, in the gaseous form, of a distillation fraction comprising hydrofluoroalkane and organic impurities, for the purpose of purifying it in the gas phase. The distillation fraction may be obtained by one or more distillations of crude hydrofluoroalkane comprising, in addition to organic impurities, possibly reagents arising as by-products or intermediates of the synthesis of the hydro- fluoroalkane. The crude hydrofluoroalkane may in particular comprise hydrogen fluoride and/or hydrogen chloride, in particular when the hydrofluoroalkane is obtained by hydrofluorination. The hydrogen fluoride and/or hydrogen chloride content in the crude hydrofluoroalkane may be reduced by distillation, such that the distillation fraction has a low hydrogen fluoride and/or hydrogen chloride content.</p><p num="p0108">This reduction of the hydrogen fluoride and/or hydrogen chloride content is particularly advantageous when a catalytic hydrogenation as described above is carried out. In this case, hydrofluoroalkane containing organic impurities and having an acidity of not more than 1000 mmol/kg is generally used in the purification treatment. Preferably, the acidity is not more than 100 mmol/kg. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
Good results are obtained with hydrofluoroalkane containing organic impurities that are essentially free of hydrogen fluoride and/or hydrogen chloride.</p><p num="p0109">In the operation intended to place the hydrofluoroalkane containing the organic impurities into the gaseous form, care is generally taken to ensure that the temperature of the hydrofluoroalkane does not exceed the temperature of the gas- phase purification treatment.</p><p num="p0110">In the seventh aspect of the process according to the invention, the gas- phase purification reaction may be advantageously followed by one or more treatments intended to separate the hydrofluoroalkane from the products of reaction between the organic impurities and the reagent. A distillation is suitable as a treatment, in particular when the reagent is hydrogen.</p><p num="p0111">In the process according to the invention, the purification treatment may be followed by one or more finishing steps intended, for example, to remove any residual acidity, in particular traces of hydrogen fluoride. A suitable finishing step for this purpose is, for example, an adsorption onto a solid such as alumina, NaF or silica.</p><p num="p0112">Other treatments which may be used are, for example, a washing with water, an extraction operation or a separation by means of a suitable membrane. The process according to the invention applies to the purification of a hydrofluoroalkane containing olefinic impurities, prepared by any synthetic process, without a pretreatment being required. The process according to the invention also applies to the purification of a hydrofluoroalkane containing organic impurities, which consists essentially of hydrofluoroalkane and organic impurities. Typically, the hydrofluoroalkane to be purified contains not more than 10% by weight of organic impurities. This content of impurities may be not more than 5% by weight. It may even be not more than 1% by weight. The process according to the invention may even be applied to a hydrofluoroalkane containing not more than 0.1% by weight of organic impurities.</p><p num="p0113">The process according to the invention finds an advantageous application in the purification of a hydrofluoroalkane obtained by hydrofluorination, in particular by hydrofluorination of a hydrochloro(fluoro)carbon.
