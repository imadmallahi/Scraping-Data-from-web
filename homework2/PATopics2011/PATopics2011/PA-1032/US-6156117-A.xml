Technical Field</p><p>This invention relates to a polymer structured, clay pigment and, more particularly, to such a pigment which is treated with a polycationic polymer in order to increase its bulking characteristics and opacifying properties. The invention also relates to a method for preparing such a clay pigment.</p><p>2. Background Description</p><p>Fine particle size pigments, e.g. fine particle size kaolin clays, have been widely used in paper and paperboard coating formulations to provide desirable levels of gloss and opacity. However, such pigments often contain a substantial amount of ultrafine particles that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light and do not scatter light efficiently. Accordingly, such fine particle clay pigments yield lower coating opacity (also referred to as hiding power and contrast ratio) than clays of more optimal particle size.</p><p>In recognition of the foregoing, methods for increasing the light scattering ability of fine clay pigments have been developed. One such method involves structuring the clay pigment by chemical or thermal means. The objective in structuring a clay pigment is to provide microvoid pore structure via clay platelet aggregation and to aggregate the ultrafine particle fraction within the pigment (e.g., particles having a particle size of less than 0.2 microns) into structured particles of more optimal particle size with respect to light scattering efficiency. In high gloss applications, the chief technical challenge still confronting the use of clay structuring strategies is the ability to improve the physical and optical characteristics of the coating pigment without hurting sheet gloss.</p><p>Several techniques have been developed to form a structured clay from a fine particle clay feed to improve the opacity thereof. Examples of these techniques include calcination of fine particle clays, hydrothermal alteration of clay particles and chemical treatment of clay particles. Two common structured pigments used in paper coatings are structured calcined clays and synthetic alkali metal alumino-silicate (SAMS) compositions.</p><p>The calcination of fine particle clays at temperatures of close to 1000 thermal sintering, to form structured products that provide increased coating opacity. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,014,836 and 4,381,948.</p><p>U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,812,299, 4,863,796, 5,112,402, 5,186,746, and 5,316,576 each discloses a SAMS composition. SAMS pigments are structured clay compositions that are produced from the reaction of a kaolin clay with an inorganic base under hydrothermal conditions as generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,812,299, 4,863,796, and 5,591,256.</p><p>It has been discovered that most calcined clays tend to be too abrasive to be used effectively in some paper-related applications. Further, existing calcined clays and SAMS compositions cannot be dispersed at high solids without structure loss and, therefore, exhibit poor high shear rheology. Moreover, such products are expensive to manufacture.</p><p>In recognition of the foregoing, methods of producing high performance, structured pigments with improved rheology and lower production costs have been developed. One such method involves treating the ultrafine particles in a kaolin (aluminosilicate) clay pigment with a flocculating agent in order to incorporate microvoid pore structure into the clay platelet aggregation. As stated above, the microvoids associated with structured pigments are responsible for providing desirable bulking and light scattering characteristics to a pigmented coating. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,075,030, 4,076,548, and 4,078,941. These patents disclose increasing the opacifying power of kaolin clay pigments by flocculating the clay particles with a non-polymeric, polyamine aggregating agent at a low slurry pH. However, such structured pigments, when "made down" into a slurry, do not have acceptable end-use properties for application in conventional paper coating compositions which are typically formulated at neutral to slightly alkaline pH values.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,726 discloses a method of treating a clay with a cationic flocculant in order to obtain a high bulking pigment with improved rheological properties. However, the Sedigraph mean particle (i.e., the average Stokes Equivalent Particle Diameter) of the kaolin clay pigment disclosed is 0.5 to 0.6 microns, prior to treatment, with less than 35% by weight of particles finer than 0.3 microns. After flocculation the particle size is substantially increased. This substantial increase in particle size causes the structured pigment to be ineffective as a component in paper coatings when high gloss is required.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,748 discloses a method for producing bulking and opacifying kaolin pigments as wet-end fillers for paper. Specifically, an aqueous slurry of anionically dispersed kaolin particles is treated at low solids with high treatment levels of a low-to-medium weight cationic polymer which serves as a flocculant. The resultant aggregate structures contain little or no fine and ultra-fine particles and such structures contain a high number of internal voids or pores. However, once again, as a result of a drastic change in the particle size of the kaolin clay particles, the optical properties of the treated pigments are adversely effected when made down and added to a paper coating. Further, the structured clay pigments so provided can only be produced at low slurry solids (less than about 30%) which is unacceptable for use as a coating pigment in conventional paper coating applications.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,718,756 also discloses a method for manufacturing a structured paper coating which includes mixing a fine particle size kaolin clay pigment with a cationic flocculant, a nonionic binder and other additives. The cationic flocculant is added at a relatively high level and is thereby believed to create a relatively large increase in the mean particle size of the pigment. Further, while the rheological or optical properties of the resulting paper coating are not disclosed, the substantial increase in the particle size of the pigment is believed to hurt the glossing properties of the same.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention is designed to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art discussed above. It is an object of the invention to provide a method of structuring a clay pigment with a polycationic polymer in order to increase the bulking characteristics and the opacifying properties of the clay.</p><p>It is another object of the invention to provide a structured pigment slurry product that includes a high percentage of solid mineral particles and that exhibits desirable rheological, stability and optical properties.</p><p>In accordance with the illustrative embodiments and demonstrating features of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a polymer structured pigment that comprises providing a quantity of fine particle size feed stock. The feed stock is slurried to provide an anionic, aqueous pigment slurry that preferably includes greater than about 50% solid mineral particles by weight. A low molecular weight, polycationic polymer is blended with the slurry in an amount of less than about 0.20% by weight on dry mineral basis. After polycationic treatment, the structured pigment slurry is dispersed with a liquid dispersant to yield a stable slurry product having desirable rheological and optical properties. It should be noted that all polymer treatment levels and dispersant addition levels disclosed herein are reported on an active weight % basis of dry clay. The median particle size of the treated mineral particles, after post-treatment dispersion, is less than about 20% larger than the median particle size of the untreated mineral particles (as determined by a Malvern laser-light scattering particle size analyzer).</p><p>Other objects, features, and advantages will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 is flow diagram setting forth the process for preparing a polymer treated structured clay product slurry and a polymer treated dry structured clay product in accordance with the present invention, and</p><p>FIG. 2 is a flow diagram setting forth an alternate method of preparing a polymer treated structured clay product slurry.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>In accordance with the present invention, polymer structured pigment products with improved rheological and optical characteristics are disclosed. Methods of preparing such pigment products are also disclosed.</p><p>The present invention sets forth two preferred treatment strategies for preparing a polymer treated, structured pigment product. The first strategy is utilized to produce a structured clay slurry via polycationic polymer treatment of a high solids clay slurry feed. The second strategy is designed to yield a dry, polymer structured clay product which can be transported in dry bulk form to a customer location and which can be subsequently made down into a high solids slurry for desired end-use application.</p><p>A preferred method of preparing a high solids, preferred structured clay product slurry is set forth in FIG. 1. The method, which is identified as Process A in FIG. 1, includes providing a quantity of fine particle size clay feed. The clay feed is slurried or obtained as a slurry process stream from a clay beneficiation plant and then concentrated to a high % solids by conventional means known in the art. The final % solids to be polymer treated is preferably from about 55% to about 75%. Thereafter, the slurry is blended with a predetermined amount of polycationic polymer. The resultant treated slurry product is then dispersed with a liquid dispersant. The addition of the post-treatment dispersant is needed to control the particle size of the polymer treated clay, to reduce slurry product viscosity and to provide long term slurry stability.</p><p>The initial clay feed is preferably a fine particle size, coating-grade clay that preferably has a TAPPI brightness of at least 85% and may consist of a non-delaminated or delaminated version. The particle size properties of a preferred non-delaminated fine particle clay feed are as follows: Malvern (LLS) median particle size of 0.3 to 1.4 microns; (2) Sedigraph median particle size (avg. stokes diameter) of 0.2 to 0.5 microns, and Sedigraph wt. %&amp;lt;2 microns of 92-100 and Sedigraph wt. %&amp;lt;0.3 microns greater than 35%. The particle size properties of a preferred delaminated clay feed are as follows: Malvern (LLS) median particle size of 1.8 to 3.4 microns; Sedigraph median particle size (Avg. Stokes Diameter) of 0.4 to 0.7 microns, and Sedigraph wt. %&amp;lt;2 microns of 82 to 96%. It should be noted that other useful mineral-based products include ground calcium carbonate and blends of calcium carbonate and clay.</p><p>Two preferred, non-delaminated kaolin clays are sold by J.M. Huber Corporation of Edison, N.J. under the marks Hydragloss Covergloss™. Two preferred delaminated clay feedstocks include Hydrafine Huber Corporation. Some typical physical properties of each of these clays are set forth in Table I.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE I______________________________________      Hydra-    Cover-   Hydra- Litho-Clay       gloss                 gloss 198                         fine                                 print  ™______________________________________TAPPI      91        90       90     89.5Brightness, %Malvern Median      0.50      1.2      2.1    3.0Particle Size, μmSedigraph  0.20      0.40     0.50   0.60Median ParticleSize, μmSedigraph  99        96       93     85particle size, wt.% &amp;lt; 2 μmpH (@ 28%  7.0       7.0      7.0    7.0solids)______________________________________</pre></p><p>The pH, brightness, Sedigraph particle size and Malvern particle size were determined as follows. Clay pH values were determined using a standard pH meter on a 28% solids (by weight) mixture of the clay with deionized water in accordance with the ASTM-D1208, E-70 procedure. The % Brightness values are standard TAPPI brightness numbers as determined with a Technidyne Micro TB-1 C brightness meter in accordance with the TAPPI Method T646 om-86 procedure. All Sedigraph particle size measurements were made via a x-ray sedimentation method based on Stokes Law using a Micromeritics 5100 Sedigraph Unit. The Malvern median particle size was obtained by using Malvern's Masterizer/E unit which is based on a laser light scattering method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,707.</p><p>The fine particle size of the clay translates to high sheet gloss when used as a component of a paper coating. The clay feedstock is slurried to a desired % solids or obtained as a slurry process stream from a clay beneficiation plant whereby the clay slurry preferably contains at least 50% solids by weight and is anionically dispersed. The slurry is then concentrated by evaporation or filtration techniques to provide a high solids, clay slurry feed (preferably from about 50% to 75% solids). Thereafter, the concentrated clay slurry is treated with a polycationic polymer. This is preferably accomplished by mixing the clay slurry in a high-shear blend tank (e.g., Cowles dissolver operating at a tip speed of at least 2,000 fpm) and slowly mixing in the cationic polymer under continuous agitation.</p><p>The cationic polymer used to impart pigment structure is preferably added in an amount of about 0.01 to about 0.1% by weight and has a molecular weight of less than 50,000 and, more preferably, less than 15,000 as determined by weight average GPC methodology. Typically, the polycationic polymer is added slowly under high shear mixing to the clay slurry as a dilute solution that can range in active polymer concentration of from about 2 to 10% by weight. The use of dilute polymer concentrations for clay treatment helps avoid shocking the clay slurry due to excessive localized clay flocculation. Clay solids dilution from polymer treatment is still almost negligible given the low treatment levels being employed. It should be noted that higher levels of polymer treatment can be employed if treating clay slurries of lower % solids, i.e., lower than 50% solids. However, to effectively produce high performance, structured clay pigments having final slurry solids contents in the range of 55% to 75%, the polymer treatment levels should be in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.1%.</p><p>A sufficient amount of polycationic polymer is added to yield the maximum clay structuring level while still maintaining an acceptable viscosity value after post-treatment dispersion with a chemical dispersant. An acceptable treated slurry is one that has an initial Brookfield (BF) viscosity of less than 500 cps (#2 spindle at 20 rpm) and that is also stable (i.e., non-gelling) with long term aging.</p><p>Preferred polycationic polymers include those having a molecular weight, as determined by GPC (Gel Permeation Chromatography) methodology, of &amp;lt;50,000 and, even more preferably, &amp;lt;15,000. A highly effective polycationic polymer is available from CPS Chemical Company, Inc. under the tradename B50-LV. B50-LV is a low molecular weight (about 8,500 by GPC) polycationic polymer based on dimethylamine epichlorohydrin chemistry. The B50-LV polymer has been found to yield significant increases in clay bulking, as measured by wet void volume determinations, while causing minimal increases in treated product median particle size relative to the median particle size of the starting clay as more fully explained below. Another suitable dimethylamine epichlorohydrin based polymer is available under the name Flocmaster 5310 from Rhone-Poulenc (molecular weight of about 12,000 by GPC). Typically, such polycationic polymers are commercially supplied as reagent solutions having 40-50% active polymer weight concentrations; however, for clay treatment purposes they are normally diluted to a polymer concentration of about 2-10% by weight. The dimethylamine epichlorohydrin polymers may be represented by the following formula: ##STR1## It should be noted that a variety of other similar low molecular weight, high charge density, polycationic polymers could be utilized such as a diallyldimethyl quaternary ammonium chloride based polymer manufactured by Calgon under the tradename Calgon Variken. This polymer is believed to possess a molecular weight in the range of 5000 to 10000 (as reported by Calgon).</p><p>After polycationic treatment, the structured clay slurry is subsequently dispersed with a chemical dispersant in order to control the resultant particle size of the polymer structured clay, to reduce slurry product viscosity and to provide long term slurry stability. Inorganic anionic dispersants, such as liquid sodium silicates, are preferably employed as the post-treatment dispersant.</p><p>The liquid sodium silicate is added into the same high-shear blend tank where the polymer treatment was first conducted in an amount required to yield a stable, non-gelling slurry product with an initial Brookfield viscosity (#2 spindle @ 20rpm) of about 150 to 500 cps. Up to 0.4% by weight of active dispersant on a dry clay basis may be added for post-treatment dispersion. However, all that is necessary is an amount sufficient to bring the structured slurry product to or near the requisite BF Viscosity. The resultant Brookfield viscosity of the structured product slurry is typically 75 to 100 cps higher than the BF viscosity of the starting clay slurry feed. It should be noted that the present polymer treatment process also slightly increases the Hercules high shear viscosity of a given fine particle size clay, but to a much lesser degree than other know structuring processes.</p><p>Liquid sodium silicates such as PQ Corporation's 3.22 weight ratio N product, are preferred chemical dispersants as more fully explained below. Sodium silicates varying in SiO.sub.2 /Na.sub.2 O weight ratio from 1:1 to 4:1 can be utilized. It should be noted that variety of other inorganic dispersants, such as sodium aluminates, phosphates and the like, that are stable and that do not adversely effect the structure of the pigment, also could be utilized.</p><p>Brookfield viscosity and the long-term stability of these treated slurries are also important characteristics of the structured clay slurry. The type of chemical dispersant added to the structured clay is a significant factor in terms of controlling final pigment particle size, reducing the product's Brookfield viscosity to a manageable level (preferably 150 to 500 cps via a #2 spindle at 20 rpm) and in yielding a slurry product exhibiting desirable stability (non-gelling) with extended aging. It has been found that there are significant advantages to utilizing sodium silicates over conventional anionic dispersants such as sodium polyacrylates.</p><p>Table II sets forth the comparative Brookfield viscosities (#2 spindle @ 20 rpm) of a polymer treated Hydragloss contained 65% solids and was treated with CPS B50-LV polymer under high shear mixing conditions with a 0.0375% addition level using a Cowles dissolver unit. Once processed, the polymer treated clay slurry was divided into two equal fractions and each fraction was subsequently dispersed with a sufficient amount of on of the dispersants to yield a minimum, acceptable BF viscosity (150 to 500 cps). The dispersants used were Rhone-Poulenc's Colloid 211 (a low molecular weight sodium polyacrylate dispersant) and N sodium silicate available from the PQ Corporation (a 3.22:1 SiO.sub.2 /Na.sub.2 O wt. ratio liquid sodium silicate).</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE II______________________________________   Disp.

More importantly, the N sodium silicate was found to provide significantly better slurry stability with aging. The requisite amount of dispersant to be added is dependent on the specific clay, the slurry solids content and the polymer treatment level employed in the polymer structuring process. Typically the dispersant can be added in an amount up to 0.40% by weight of active dispersant on a dry clay basis, although additions up to 0.25% by weight are more typical and preferred. As stated above, the dispersant only has to be added in an amount sufficient to bring the structured slurry product to or near the minimum, acceptable Brooklield Viscosity. It should be noted that over dispersion may have a negative impact on the structured clay product's opacity performance.</p><p>FIG. 1 also sets forth a process, identified as Process B, for yielding a dry, structured clay product which can be transported in dry bulk form to a customer location and can then be subsequently made-down into a high solids slurry for end-use application. This is accomplished by treating the slurried feedstock (50-54% solids) with the polycationic polymer. The treated slurred product is then dispersed with sodium silicate and spray dried to yield a dry structured clay which can be readily transported and can be subsequently made down. The spray drying step in Process B is carried out under typical commercial drying conditions, wherein inlet air temperatures of about 400 to 650 about 100 to 130 clay product preferably has a free moisture content of less than 1.0 wt. %.</p><p>FIG. 2 discloses an alternate process (identified as Process C) for producing a structured clay product slurry. This process is similar to Process A described above except that the slurried feedstock is not concentrated prior to polymer treatment. The advantage of Process C is that the polymer treatment step can be carried out more quickly. However, the addition rate of the polycationic polymer has to be more carefully monitored to avoid any intermittent gellation problems.</p><p>Table III compares the performance differences between structured Hydragloss C described above and illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE III__________________________________________________________________________                        Hercules                             Coating              Malvern                   BF Visc.,                        Visc.

The coating contrast ratio values were obtained using a standard draw down test on Leneta black/white cards in a manner known in the art. Specifically, the various clay slurry products were diluted by to 50% solids to which 10 parts of Dow 620 latex binder (per 100 parts of active clay) was added with good mixing. Each clay/latex combination was mixed with a lab Lightnin mixer at low shear for approximately 5 minutes. Thereafter, ammonium hydroxide was then added to adjust the pH of the slurry to above 8.5 and ASE-60 thickener was then added in order to raise the Brookfield Viscosity to between 500 and 1000 cps. The resultant coating formulations were then drawn down on the Leneta cards using a 10 rod and subsequently air dried in order to make the required optical readings. Contrast ratio is a measure of coating opacity, with higher values indicating greater coverage capability.</p><p>Table III indicates that at equivalent polymer treatment levels, virtually equivalent physical properties and coating performance were obtained independent of the process method employed to make the polymer structured clay products. Although relatively small in magnitude, the most significant difference is seen in the BF viscosity value. However, the equivalent coating performance of the two structured products strongly suggest that the treatment polymer is able to redistribute itself over the total number of clay particles present such that virtually equivalent types of clay structuring are ultimately obtained.</p><p>The treatment of the kaolin clay particles with the low molecular weight polycationic polymer, like CPS B50-LV, has been shown to selectively flocculate (or aggregate) the fine particle size particles in the clay without significantly increasing the median size of the clay as a whole. The minimal increase in particle size is attributed to the preferential micro-flocculation of the ultrafine particle fraction that takes place when the particles are treated with the low molecular weight polymer. Prior known treatments of kaolin clay particles with cationic polymers result in significant increases in particle size (macroflocculation) and, therefore, have a negative impact on the sheet gloss properties of the pigmented paper coating. The micro-flocculation in the present invention results in only a minor increase in the clay pigments median particle size.</p><p>Table IV sets forth some comparative properties of various polymer treated Hydragloss</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE IV__________________________________________________________________________                           Malvern                               Coating           Wet Void        median                               contrast           Volume,         particle                               ratio (10Sample    Description      RSV, ml           ml/g Clay Slurry Viscosity                           size, μm                               rod)__________________________________________________________________________                BF Visc.,                     Hercules                cps @                     Visc.

The various polymers were each added slowly in diluted form at an active polymer weight concentration of about 3%. After each polymer treatment, N sodium silicate was added in order to control the resultant particle size of the structured clay product and to disperse the structured clay product to a desired viscosity. The median clay particle size data of Table IV indicates that the Hydragloss molecular weight polycationic polymers CPS B50-LV and Flocmaster 5310, molecular weight ˜8500 and ˜12,000 respectively, underwent a high level of structuring as reflected by the treated clay's high relative sedimentation volume (RSV) values and the improved contrast ratio properties.</p><p>The relative sedimentation volume of the treated and untreated clay was obtained in the following manner. The clay product slurry was diluted back to a solids content of 30% and 14 ml of the 30% clay suspension was introduced into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. The tube was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 hours. Thereafter, the sedimentation volume was measured. The void volume per unit weight of clay was then calculated by the following equation:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->void volume/unit weight of clay=(sedimentation volume-(total weight of dry clay/clay density))/total weight of clay</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->void volume (ml)/unit weight of clay (g)=(sedimentation volume-(5.13 grams/2.6))/5.13</pre></p><p>High values for wet void volume/unit weight of clay are important as they indicate high levels of bulking resulting from the incorporation of microvoid pore structure. This pore structure can translate to desirable optical properties such as light scattering and the like if it is of the appropriate pore diameter size. It has been determined that pigment porosity introduced into a coating having an average pore diameter size of around 0.3 microns is most optically efficient since such air filled pores are roughly half the wavelength of visible light (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,746).</p><p>The RSV value or wet void volume for a given mineral pigment is a measure of how densely the individual particles from an aqueous suspension have been packed together once completely settled into a wet sediment. The more compact or denser the mineral sediment is the less wet void volume there will be in the sediment. Wet void volume results from imperfect particle packing due to the shape(s) of the various particles present. Structured pigment particles, given their high porosity characteristics, have been shown to provide a high wet void volume content which is reflected in a higher RSV value for a given weight amount of mineral pigment tested. Therefore, RSV values (or the related wet void volume values per gram of dry pigment) can provide a relative measure of a mineral pigment's overall bulking ability or its porosity/structure level. The introduction of air microvoids into a paper coating through the use of structured, porous pigments is a well-known means of improving light scattering efficiency which translates to increased opacity.</p><p>In conducting the drawdown tests in Table IV, both the treated and untreated Hydragloss 50% slurry solids. 10 parts of Dow 620 latex binder (per 100 parts of active clay) was added with good mixing (mixed with a Lightnin mixer at low shear for ˜5 minutes). The pH of the slurry was adjusted to above 8.5 by using ammonium hydroxide. An ASE-60 thickener was added to the slurry while the same was being mixed in order to obtain a Brookfield viscosity of between 500 and 1000 cps. After such a viscosity was obtained, the resultant coating formulations were then drawn down on Leneta black/white cards using a 10 rod and subsequently air dried in order to determine the contrast ratios of the samples. Contrast ratio is a measure of coating opacity, with higher values indicating greater coverage capability.</p><p>The term micro-flocculation has been used to describe this clay/polymer structuring obtained when employing low molecular weight polycationic polymers, such as CPS B50-LV and Flocmaster 5310, since a minimal change in the clay's median particle size is obtained. Structuring with the low molecular weight polycationic polymers yielded the greatest improvements in coating contrast ratio relative to the untreated Hydragloss contrast, the clays treated with the medium to high MW polymers (i.e., Flocmaster 5311, X-WK-06 and Calgon 261-LV) yielded structured clay products of significantly coarser particle size versus the control sample (see Table IV). Samples B, C, D and E of Table IV demonstrate the deleterious effect on resultant coating coverage as the treatment polymer's molecular weight is increased and, in particular, as the treatment polymer's molecular weight is increased above 15,000 within the family of dimethylamine epichlorohydrin polymers tested.</p><p>It should be noted that although the Calgon Variken polymer used in Sample G of Table III also has a low molecular weight (&amp;lt;10,000) and accordingly provides a high RSV value with a minimal change in the final treated product particle size. However, the resultant structured clay produced from the Calgon Variken polymer yielded only a modest improvement in contrast ratio relative to those provided by the CPS B50-LV or the Flocmaster 5310 polymer treated pigments. This large difference in coating coverage/opacity is believed to be due to differences in polymer chemistry. Specifically, the Variken polymer is a dimethyl diallyl quaternary ammonium chloride based polycationic polymer whereas the CPS B50-LV and Flocmaster 5310 polymers are dimethylamine epichlorohydrin based polymers. It is apparent that the structured clays treated with the CPS B50-LV and Flocmaster 5310 polymers are more efficient in scattering light. It follows that such polymers flocculate the clay particles in such a way as to produce porosity (i.e., internal pore structure) that is more optically efficient. In particular, pores having a pore diameter size of about 0.3 microns have been previously shown to be optically efficient.</p><p>The addition levels for these low molecular weight polycationic polymers required for maximum clay structuring without gelling are significantly less than for the polycationic polymers outside the scope of this invention. When polymer treating fine particle clay slurries of about 50 to 75% solids, the required addition levels for these polymers generally falls into the range of about 0.01 to 0.10% by weight of active polymer on a dry clay basis. As shown in Table IV, the polymer addition levels needed with higher molecular weight polycationic polymers are significantly higher and they often exceed addition levels of 0.1% by weight to yield the maximum level of clay structuring.</p><p>Table V displays the minimal increase in median particle size of several different clays treated with a low molecular weight cationic polymer in accordance with the process described above and identified as Process A in FIG. 1.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE V______________________________________    Initial               Median P.S.                                  %    (LLS                  (LLS    Change    Malvern) Polymer      Malvern) of                                  in    Median   treatment (in                          treated clay,                                  MedianClay Feed    P.S., μm             active wt. %)                          clay, μm                                  P.S______________________________________Clay Treatments Within Scope of the Present InventionCovergloss    1.17     0.05% B50-LV +                          1.13    -3.4             0.30% N silicate             @ 65% clay             solidsLithoprint    2.86     0.04% B50-LV +                          3.01    5.2             0.30% N silicate             @ 65% clay             solidsLithoprint    2.86     0.0250% B50- 2.93    2.4             LV + 0.011% N             Silicate @ 68%             clay solidsHydragloss 90    0.46     0.0375% B50- 0.48    4.3             LV + 0.094% N             silicate @ 65%             clay solidsHydragloss 90    0.44     0.0375% B50- 0.48    9.1             LV + 0.056% N             silicate @ 65%             clay solidsHydragloss 90    0.44     0.0375%      0.48    9.1             Flocmaster 5310 +             0.056% N             silicate @ 65%             clay solidsOther Polymer TreatmentsHydragloss 90    0.44     0.0625%      0.65    48             Flocmaster 5311 +             0.113% N             silicate @ 65%             clay solidsHydragloss 90    0.44     0.08% Calgon 2.38    441             261 + 0.113% N             silicate @ 65%             clay solids______________________________________</pre></p><p>As can be seen from Table V, fine particle size pigments treated with low molecular weight polycationic polymers (i.e., molecular weight of 15,000 or less) exhibit only a slight change in median particle size. The resultant change in Malvern median particle size is generally less than about 20% and, more preferably, less than about 10% relative to the median particle size of the starting clay feedstock. Such a minimal change in particle size results in no significant reduction in sheet gloss. However, bulking and, therefore, opacity is significantly increased when the resulting structured pigment is incorporated into a paper coating.</p><p>One of the key advantages of the structuring technology described above is the relative simplicity of the polymer treatment process. After adding the post-treatment dispersant, the polymer treated slurry products can be used for paper coating applications without the need for further processing steps. Additionally, the long term stability and the desirable Brookfield Viscosity are also advantageous from a transit and/or storage viewpoint.</p><p>Table VI sets forth some tests results of polymer structured products made from different fine particle clay pigments. Delaminated and non-delaminated types of fine particle clays were examined. Each of the structured slurries disclosed in Table VI was produced via a Cowles dissolver at a pH of 7 Each clay feedstock slurry was polymer treated under high shear mixing with a 0.038% addition level of CPS B50-LV polymer. After polymer treatment, the structured product slurries were then dispersed with an effective amount of N sodium silicate to bring the product slurry to minimum BF viscosity.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE VI______________________________________                            Malvern                                  Coating                            median                                  contrast                            particle                                  ratioSample Description Clay Slurry Viscosity                            size, μm                                  (10 rod)______________________________________             BF Visc.,                      Hercules             cps @ 20 Visc.

Furthermore, in each test case, structured product slurries with acceptable viscosity properties were produced while the Malvern median particle size values were only slightly different from those measured on the starting clay feeds. Changes in the Malvern median particle size were quite small, the largest being on the order of only 10%.</p><p>Table VII demonstrates the coating performance properties of coatings prepared with untreated Hydragloss and Hycal Hydragloss kaolin clay product by J.M. Huber Corporation. The blending of small amounts of calcined clay pigments, on the order of 5-25% of the total pigment content, with coating grade kaolin clays is a well known product strategy in the art for increasing bulking and improving the net scattering efficiency of a clay based paper coating. Calcined clays, such as Hycal significantly coarser in median particle size than the polymer structured clays of this invention.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE VII__________________________________________________________________________                       65% solids,                               68% solids,                       Hydragloss 90                               Hydragloss 90         Slurry blend of                Slurry blend of                       treated w/                               treated w/  Hydragloss         10% Hycal and                20% Hycal +                       0.038% B50-                               0.0333% B50-  90, untreated,         90%    80%    LV + 0.094%                               LV + 0.083%  70% solids         Hydragloss 90                Hydragloss 90                       N sodium silicate                               N sodium silicate__________________________________________________________________________Paper Coating Formulation (in active parts by wt.)Clay   100    100    100    100     100SBR Latex  12     12     12     12      12(Dow 620)Starch  3      3      3      3       3Ca Stearate   0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5     0.5Performance Data for Coated PaperCoat wt.,   6.0    6.0    6.0    6.0     6.0#/reamOpacity, %  81.9   82.3   82.7   82.5    82.4Paper Gloss, %  68.7   67.6   66.4   69.1    69Print Gloss @  69.9   70.1   69.5   70.9    70.41.5 OD, %Brightness, %  68.8   69.4   69.5   69.8    69.2Whiteness  47.8   48.7   50     49.9    49.7IndexIGT-low oil  62     74     78     50      53(cm/sec)K&amp;N: % 87.8   87.3   84     86      87.3retained__________________________________________________________________________</pre></p><p>The coating formulations set forth in Table VII were applied at a coat weight of 6.0 #/ream to a 28 #/ream basestock using a CLC pilot coater operating at a speed of about 4,000 rpm.
