No. 5,346,963 discloses Substantially Linear Ethylene Polymers grafted with an organic acid, such as maleic acid or maleic anhydride. However these polymers are the result of a grafting reaction rather than the product of a copolymerization reaction between a terminally unsaturated macromonomer and an unsaturated acid or anhydride.</p><p>Copolymers of maleic anhydride and other olefins are known in the literature. For example copolymers of maleic anhydride and alpha-olefins have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,545. These copolymers are of rather low molecular weights, i.e. approximately C12-C18 with molecular weights of 250 or less. Copolymers of maleic anhydride and styrene are known, for example see U.S. Pat. No. 4,839,074 and European Patent Applications 0 214 786 and 0 296 714. Likewise copolymers of isobutylene and maleic anhydride are apparently disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,507. But this polymer is expected to have the disadvantage of little to no crystallinity, which would mean poor strength characteristics in a final adhesive.</p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>This invention relates to a copolymer, which has many potential commercial uses where adhesion is a key property, for example, assembly adhesives, road marking compositions, etc. This invention further relates to an adhesive comprising an optional tackifying resin and a copolymer comprising units derived from one or more macromonomers and an unsaturated acid or anhydride wherein the copolymer's weight average molecular weight is at least two times the weight average molecular weight of the macromonomer and the copolymer's melt index is greater than or equal to 1 dg/min. If more than one macromonomer is used and they have different molecular weights then the copolymer's Mw is compared to the weighted average of the weight average molecular weights of the macromonomers. For the purposes of this invention an adhesive is any composition that adheres to itself or another substrate.</p><p>Preferably, this invention relates to an adhesive composition comprising an optional resin and a copolymer comprising units derived from one or more macromonomers and an unsaturated acid or an unsaturated anhydride wherein the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the copolymer is at least three times the Mw of the macromonomer and wherein the macromonomer:</p><p>(1) has an Mw between 500 and 100,000;</p><p>(2) has at least 30% terminal unsaturation; and</p><p>(3) comprises a copolymer of ethylene and at least one α-olefin, and/or a copolymer of propylene and ethylene or an α-olefin.</p><p>Terminal unsaturation is defined to include both vinyl and vinylidene unsaturation.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment the Mw of the copolymer of the macromonomer and the unsaturated acid or unsaturated anhydride is at least four times larger than the Mw of the macromonomer, preferably at least five times larger than the Mw of the macromonomer, even more preferably at least six times larger than the Mw of the macromonomer. In a preferred embodiment the melt index of the copolymer of the macromonomer and the unsaturated acid or anhydride is greater than or equal to 1 dg/min, preferably greater than or equal to 2 dg/min. Melt index is measured according to ASTM D-1238. If the melt index cannot be measured because the molecular weight of the sample is too low, then the melt index is deemed to be greater than 2 dg/min for purposes of this invention.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In a preferred embodiment the macromonomers comprise copolymers of ethylene and up to 75 weight % of one or more C.sub.3 to C.sub.30 α-olefins, based upon the weight of the copolymer. The C.sub.3 to C.sub.30 α-olefin may be a linear or branched α-olefin, and is preferably selected from the group consisting of propylene, butene, isobutene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene, dodecene, 3-methyl-pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, 2-ethyl-hexene, and 3,5,5-trimethyl hexene-1.</p><p>In another preferred embodiment the macromonomer comprises a copolymer of propylene and up to 75 weight % ethylene and/or a C.sub.4 to C.sub.30 α-olefin, based upon the weight of the copolymer. The C.sub.4 to C.sub.30 α-olefin may be a linear or branched α-olefin, and is preferably selected from the group consisting of butene, isobutene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene, dodecene, 3-methyl-pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, 2-ethyl-hexene, and 3,5,5-trimethyl hexene-1.</p><p>In another preferred embodiment the macromonomer comprises a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and one or more C.sub.4 to C.sub.30 α-olefins. Preferred C.sub.4 to C.sub.30 α-olefins include linear or branched α-olefins, preferably α-olefins selected from the group consisting of butene, isobutene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene, dodecene, 3-methyl-pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, 2-ethyl-hexene, and 3,5,5-trimethyl hexene- 1.</p><p>The macromonomers can be produced by polymerizing the desired monomers in the presence of an activated cyclopentadienyl transition metal catalyst. Such catalysts typically comprise cyclopentadienyl transition metal compounds combined with an activator such as an alumoxane or a non-coordinating anion. The transition metal may be bound to one, two or three cyclopentadienyl groups and the groups may be substituted or unsubstituted and bridged or unbridged. The activated catalyst may be used in gas phase, slurry phase, solution phase, in bulk or high pressure.
