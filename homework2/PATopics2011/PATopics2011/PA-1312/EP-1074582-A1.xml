containing a combination of starch, modified starch and/or
starch/plasticizer composite together with selected
methylene donor and/or methylene acceptor compounds. The
invention also relates to tires having at least one
component comprised of such rubber composition. Such tire
component can be, for example, its circumferential tread or
other component of the tire.</p><heading><u style="single">Background</u></heading><p num="0002">Starch, modified starch and starch/plasticizer
composites have sometimes been used in various compositions
which might have included elastomer formulations, for
various purposes which might have included tire components
such as tire treads.</p><p num="0003">Such materials might be used alone or in conjunction
with silica and/or carbon black reinforcing fillers or also
with other fillers such as, for example, recycled, or
ground, vulcanized rubber particles, short fibers, kaolin
clay, mica, talc, titanium oxide and limestone. Such short
fibers can be, for example, fibers of cellulose, aramid,
nylon, polyester and carbon composition.</p><p num="0004">US-A- 5,403,923, 5,258,430, and 4,900,361 disclose the
preparation and use of various starch compositions and US-A- 5,672,639 relates to use of starch/plasticizer
composites in rubber compositions including as a tire
component such as a tire tread.</p><p num="0005">However, use of starch-based fillers, in general, may
present some limitations as reinforcement for various
elastomers where resistance to abrasion and tear properties
for elastomer composition are significantly desirable
properties.</p><p num="0006">Accordingly, it is desired to enhance the use of
starch-based materials in elastomer compositions. </p><p num="0007">Historically, starch may typically be represented as a
carbohydrate polymer having repeating units of amylose
(anhydroglucopyranose units joined by glucosidic bonds) and
amylopectin, a branched chain structure, as is well known
to those having skill in such art. Often, starch is
composed of 25 percent amylose and 75 percent amylopectin.
[<u style="single">The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, Ninth Edition</u> (1977,
revised by G.G. Hawley, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold
Company, page 813]. Starch can be, reportedly, a reserve
polysaccharide in plants such as, for example, corn,
potatoes, rice and wheat as typical commercial sources.</p><p num="0008">Starch by itself typically has a softening point of
200°C or above and, therefore, usually is thought of as
having a somewhat limited use in many rubber products,
primarily because rubber compositions are normally
processed by preliminarily blending rubber with various
ingredients at temperatures in a range of 140°C to 170°C,
usually at least 160°C, and sometimes up to 180°C which is
not a high enough temperature to cause the starch (with
softening temperature of at least 200°C) to effectively
melt and efficiently blend with the rubber composition. As
a result, the starch particles tend to remain in individual
domains, or granules, within the rubber composition rather
than as a more homogeneous blend.</p><p num="0009">Accordingly, starch is sometimes modified with a
plasticizer of lower softening point to create a
starch/plasticizer composite for use in rubber
compositions.</p><p num="0010">The term "phr" as used herein, and according to
conventional practice, refers to "parts of a respective
material per 100 parts by weight of rubber, or elastomer".</p><p num="0011">In the description of this invention, the terms
"rubber" and "elastomer" where used herein, may be used
interchangeably, unless otherwise prescribed. The terms
"rubber composition", "compounded rubber" and "rubber
compound", where used herein, are used interchangeably to
refer to "rubber which has been blended or mixed with 
various ingredients and materials" and such terms are well
known to those having skill in the rubber mixing or rubber
compounding art.</p><p num="0012">The term "carbon black" as used herein means "carbon
blacks having properties typically used in the
reinforcement of elastomers, particularly sulfur curable
elastomers".</p><p num="0013">The term "silica" as used herein can relate to
precipitated or fumed silica and typically relates to
precipitated silica, including an aluminosilicate, which is
well known to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0014">A reference to an elastomer's Tg refers to its glass
transition temperature, which can conveniently be
determined by a differential scanning calorimeter at a
heating rate of 10°C per minute.</p><heading><u style="single">Summary and Practice of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0015">In accordance with one aspect of this invention, a
rubber composition is provided which comprises (A) 100
parts by weight of at least one diene-based elastomer, (B)
0.1 to 120, alternatively 25 to 90, phr of at least one
elastomer reinforcing filler composed of (1) 0.1 to 120,
alternatively 5 to 70, phr of at least one starch-based
material selected from at least one of starch,
starch/plasticizer composite and modified starch, and (2)
zero to 90, alternatively 20 to 85, phr of (a) carbon black
or silica, namely an amorphous silica or (b) carbon black
and silica, namely an amorphous silica; and, optionally, at
least one additional inorganic reinforcing or non-reinforcing
filler, (C) optionally a coupler for said
starch-based material and silica, if silica is used, where
said coupler has a moiety reactive with the surface of said
starch composite and the surface of said silica, as the
case may be, and a moiety interactive with the said
elastomer, and (D) a methylene acceptor and/or methylene
donor exclusive of hexamethylene tetramine.</p><p num="0016">Preferably, said modified starch is selected from at 
least one of hydroxyethylated starch, oxidized starch and
acid modified starch.</p><p num="0017">In practice, said starch is typically composed of
amylose units and amylopectin units in a ratio of 15/85 to
35/65, alternatively 20/80 to 30/70, and has a softening
point according to ASTM No. D1228 in a range of 180°C to
220°C; and the starch/plasticizer has a softening point in
a range of 110°C to 170°C according to ASTM No. D1228</p><p num="0018">In the practice of this invention it is preferred that
the methylene donor compound contains an
-CH<sub>2</sub>OX group wherein X is an alkyl radical having from one
to 8 carbon atoms, preferably selected from methyl, ethyl,
propyl and octyl radicals and is exclusive of hexamethylene
tetramine, for example, see US-A- 5,886,074.</p><p num="0019">Representative of such methylene donor compounds,
exclusive of hexamethylene tetramine are, for example,
hexamethoxymethylmelamine, hexaethoxymethylmelamine and
ethoxymethylpyridinium chloride; and N-methylol derivatives
of melamine such as, for example N,N',N''-trimethylolmelamine,
N-methylolmelamine and N',N''-dimethhylolmelamine.</p><p num="0020">Representative of methylene acceptor compounds are,
for example, phenolic cashew nut oil resins, resorcinol
monobenzoate and polyhydric phenoxy resin, preferably
phenolic cashew nut oil resin, for example, see
US-A- 5,206,289 and 4,605,696.</p><p num="0021">Such phenolic cashew nut oil resins may be available,
for example, as SP6700 from the Schnectady company.</p><p num="0022">Phenolic resins are conventionally produced by an acid
condensation of phenol, or a mixture of phenols, with an
aldehyde, usually formaldehyde. Such phenolic resins might
be referred to as two-stage resins and are conventionally
known as novolacs. This technology is understood to be
well known to those having skill in such art. The
Schenectady resin SP6700 is a two-stage phenolic resin from
a condensation of a phenol and aldehyde, (a novolac), in
which the phenolic component is a mixture of phenol and 
liquid cashew nut oil which might sometimes be referred to
as "CSL". The CSL might be described as a mixture of
primarily monophenols substituted in the meta position with
C15 hydrocarbon chains.</p><p num="0023">A significant feature of this invention is that it has
been observed that hexamethylene tetramine, a well known
methylene donor, did not work satisfactorily for use in
this invention where the starch-based materials are
utilized either by itself or in combination with the
preferred methylene acceptors, namely, phenolic cashew nut
oil resins. This result was unexpected and illustrated
that not all methylene donor compounds, as a chemical class
of materials, work satisfactorily for the purposes of this
invention.</p><p num="0024">A significant aspect of use of a methylene donor,
exclusive of hexamethylene tetramine, in combination with
starch, modified starch or starch/plasticizer composite is
an observed improvement in tear resistance of a rubber
composition which is an important physical property of
rubber compositions to be used for various components of a
tire.</p><p num="0025">In practice, it has been observed herein that the
hexamethylene tetramine, which is often thought of as being
a methylene donor (see US-A- 5,886,074) was not observed
herein to behave in a manner similar to other common
methylene donors such as for example
hexamethoxymethylmelamine.</p><p num="0026">A significant aspect is that it has been observed
herein that the use of a methylene donor or a methylene
acceptor, or a combination of both, resulted in an improved
tear resistance property for a vulcanized rubber
composition.</p><p num="0027">In particular, is has been observed herein that a
significant aspect of use of a combination of methylene
acceptor, particularly a phenolic cashew nut oil resin, and
methylene donor, exclusive of hexamethylene tetramine, in
combination with starch, modified starch or 
starch/plasticizer composite provided an improved tear
resistance property for a vulcanized rubber composition
better than use of a silane coupling agent alone for tear
resistance improvement.</p><p num="0028">In practice, the moiety of the coupling agent which is
reactive with the starch, modified starch and
starch/plasticizer composite as well as silica surfaces is
generally considered herein as being capable of reacting
with at least one or more hydroxyl groups on their surfaces
and possibly with other reactive groups thereon.</p><p num="0029">In the practice of this invention, the starch,
modified starch and starch/plasticizer composite may be
desired to be used, for example, as a free flowing, dry
powder or in a free flowing, dry pelletized form.</p><p num="0030">With regard to the modified starch, various modified
starches may be utilized. Representative of commercially
available modified starches are, for example
hydroxyethylated starch as ETHYLEX 2095, oxidized starch as
STA-COTE H44 and acid modified starch as ECLIPSE G, all
from the A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company.</p><p num="0031">Where the modified starch is a hydroxyethylated
starch, it might be described, for example, as a starch
which has been subjected to a treatment in which
hydroxyethyl groups have been substituted for a very small
number of hydroxyl groups of the starch.</p><p num="0032">With regard to the starch/plasticizer composite, it is
desired that the synthetic plasticizer itself is compatible
with the starch, and has a softening point lower than the
softening point of the starch so that it causes the
softening of the blend of the plasticizer and the starch to
be lower than that of the starch alone. This phenomenon of
blends of compatible polymers of differing softening points
having a softening point lower than the highest softening
point of the individual polymer(s) in the blend is well
known to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0033">For the purposes of this invention, the plasticizer
effect for the starch/plasticizer composite, (meaning a 
softening point of the composite being lower than the
softening point of the starch), can be obtained through use
of a polymeric plasticizer such as, for example,
poly(ethylenevinyl alcohol) with a softening point of less
than 160°C. Other plasticizers, and their mixtures, are
contemplated for use in this invention, provided that they
have softening points of less than the softening point of
the starch, and preferably less than 160°C, which might be,
for example, one or more copolymers and hydrolyzed
copolymers thereof selected from ethylene-vinyl acetate
copolymers having a vinyl acetate molar content of from 5
to 90, alternatively 20 to 70, percent, ethylene-glycidal
acrylate copolymers and ethylene-maleic anhydride
copolymers. As hereinbefore stated hydrolyzed forms of
copolymers are also contemplated. For example, the
corresponding ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers, and
ethylene-acetate vinyl alcohol terpolymers may be
contemplated so long as they have a softening point lower
than that of the starch and preferably lower than 160°C.</p><p num="0034">In general, for the starch/plasticizer composite, the
blending of the starch and plasticizer involves what are
considered or believed herein to be relatively strong
chemical and/or physical interactions between the starch
and the plasticizer.</p><p num="0035">In general, the starch/plasticizer composite has a
desired starch to plasticizer weight ratio in a range of
0.5/1 to 4/1, alternatively 1/1 to 2/1, so long as the
starch/plasticizer composition has the required softening
point range, and preferably, is capable of being a free
flowing, dry powder or extruded pellets, before it is mixed
with the elastomer(s).</p><p num="0036">While, for the starch/plasticizer composite, the
synthetic plasticizer(s) may have a viscous nature at room
temperature, or at 23°C and, thus, considered to be a
liquid for the purposes of this description, although the
plasticizer may actually be a viscous liquid at room
temperature since it is to be appreciated that many 
plasticizers are polymeric in nature.</p><p num="0037">For the starch/plasticizer composite, representative
examples of synthetic plasticizers are, for example,
poly(ethylenevinyl alcohol), cellulose acetate and diesters
of dibasic organic acids, so long as they have a softening
point sufficiently below the softening point of the starch
with which they are being combined so that the
starch/plasticizer composite has the required softening
point range.</p><p num="0038">Preferably, the synthetic plasticizer is selected from
at least one of poly(ethylenevinyl alcohol) and cellulose
acetate.</p><p num="0039">For example, for the starch/plasticizer composite, the
aforesaid poly(ethylenevinyl alcohol) might be prepared by
polymerizing vinyl acetate to form a poly(vinylacetate)
which is then hydrolyzed (acid or base catalyzed) to form
the poly(ethylenevinyl alcohol). Such reaction of vinyl
acetate and hydrolyzing of the resulting product is well
known those skilled in such art.</p><p num="0040">For example, vinylalcohol/ethylene (60/40 mole ratio)
copolymers can be obtained in powder forms at different
molecular weights and crystallinities such as, for example,
a molecular weight of 11700 with an average particle size
of 11.5 microns or a molecular weight (weight average) of
60,000 with an average particle diameter of less than 50
microns.</p><p num="0041">For the starch/plasticizer composite, various blends
of starch and ethylenevinyl alcohol copolymers can then be
prepared according to mixing procedures well known to those
having skill in such art. For example, a procedure might
be utilized according to a recitation in the publication by
Bastioli, Bellotti and Del Trediu entitled "A Polymer
Composition Including Destructured Starch An Ethylene
Copolymer", US-A- 5,403,374.</p><p num="0042">Other plasticizers might be prepared, for example and
so long as they have the appropriate Tg and starch
compatibility requirements, by reacting one or more 
appropriate organic dibasic acids with aliphatic or
aromatic diol(s) in a reaction which might sometimes be
referred to as an esterification condensation reaction.
Such esterification reactions are well known to those
skilled in such art.</p><p num="0043">In the practice of this invention, the aforesaid
additional inorganic fillers may be, for example, selected
from one or more of kaolin clay, talc, short discrete
fibers, thermoplastic powders such as polyethylene and
polypropylene particles, or other reinforcing or non-reinforcing
inorganic fillers.</p><p num="0044">In the description of this invention, such additional
inorganic fillers are intended to be exclusive of, or to
not include, pigments conventionally used in the
compounding, or preparation of, rubber compositions such as
zinc oxide, titanium oxide and the like, although, of
course zinc oxide is conventionally used in the rubber
compositions of this invention.</p><p num="0045">The additional short fibers for use in the rubber
composition of this invention may be, for example, of
organic polymeric materials such as cellulose, aramid,
nylon and polyester.</p><p num="0046">In practice, the said starch/synthetic plasticizer
composite has a moisture content in a range of zero to 30,
alternatively one to six, weight percent.</p><p num="0047">In practice, as hereinbefore pointed out, the
elastomer reinforcement may be (i) the starch/plasticizer
composite or (ii) a combination of the starch/plasticizer
composite and at least one of carbon black and amorphous
silica, particularly precipitated silica or (iii)
optionally a combination of the starch/plasticizer, carbon
black and/or precipitated silica and at least one other
inorganic filler, wherein a coupler is optionally used to
couple the starch composite and the silica, if silica is
used, to the diene based elastomer(s).</p><p num="0048">It is considered herein that, where desired, the said
starch-based material can be used as (i) a partial or (ii) 
complete replacement for carbon black and/or silica
reinforcement for sulfur vulcanizable elastomers, depending
somewhat upon the properties desired for the cured, or
vulcanized, rubber composition.</p><p num="0049">In practice, it is generally preferred that the rubber
reinforcing carbon black is used in conjunction with the
said starch-based material in an amount of at least 5 and
preferably at least 35 phr of carbon black, depending
somewhat upon the structure of the carbon black. Carbon
black structure is often represented by its DBP
(dibutylphthalate) value. Reinforcing carbon blacks
typically have a DBP number in a range of 40 to 400 cc/100
gm, and more usually in a range of 80 to 300 (ASTM D 1265).
If the carbon black content is used with a view to
providing an elastomer composition with a suitable
electrical conductivity to retard or prevent appreciable
static electricity build up, a minimum amount of carbon
black in the elastomer composition might be, for example,
10 phr of a highly electrically conductive carbon black is
used, otherwise usually at least 25 and often at least 35
phr of carbon black is used.</p><p num="0050">If desired, and on a practical basis, it is usually
preferred that the coupling agent for the said starch-based
material can be the same coupler as could be used for the
silica, if silica is used. Thus, it is considered herein
that the moiety of the coupling agent reactive with the
surface of the starch-based material is also reactive with
the hydroxyl (e.g. SiOH) groups, and/other reactive groups,
typically on the surface of the silica.</p><p num="0051">It is important to appreciate that, preferably, the
said starch-based material is not used as a total
replacement for carbon black and/or silica in an elastomer
composition. Thus, in one aspect, it is considered that
the starch-based material is to be typically used as a
partial replacement for carbon black and/or silica
reinforcement for sulfur vulcanizable elastomers.</p><p num="0052">It is important to appreciate that, while starch 
itself might be used in combination with the
starch/plasticizer composite, they are not considered
herein as equal alternatives. Thus, while starch might
sometimes be considered suitable as a reinforcement for the
elastomer composition together with the coupling agent, the
starch/plasticizer composite may be considered more
desirable for some applications, even when used without a
coupling agent.</p><p num="0053">If silica is used as a reinforcement together with
carbon black, the weight ratio of silica to carbon black is
desirably in a weight ratio in a range of 0.1/1 to 10/1,
thus at least 0.1/1, alternatively at least 0.9/1,
optionally at least 3/1 and sometimes at least 10/1.</p><p num="0054">The weight ratio of said silica coupler to the starch
composite and silica, if silica is used, may, for example,
be in a range of 0.01/1 to 0.2/1 or even up to 0.4/1.</p><p num="0055">The starch is recited as being composed of amylose
units and/or amylopectin units. These are well known
components of starch. Typically, the starch is composed of
a combination of the amylose and amylopectin units in a
ratio of 25/75. A somewhat broader range of ratios of
amylose to amylopectin units is recited herein in order to
provide a starch for the starch composite which interact
with the plasticizer somewhat differently. For example, it
is considered herein that suitable ratios may be from 20/80
up to 100/0, although a more suitable range is considered
to be 15/85 to 35/65. Thus, the starch may be composed
primarily or even entirely of amylose units.</p><p num="0056">The starch can typically be obtained from naturally
occurring plants, as hereinbefore referenced. Corn starch
is believes to be a rather common natural starch. The
starch/plasticizer composite can be present in various
particulate forms such as, for example, fibrils, spheres or
macromolecules, which may, in one aspect, depend somewhat
upon the ratio of amylose to amylopectin in the starch as
well as the plasticizer content in the composite.</p><p num="0057">The relative importance, if any, of such forms of the 
starch is the difference in their reinforcing associated
with the filler morphology. The morphology of the filler
primarily determines the final shape of the starch
composite within the elastomer composition, in addition,
the severity of the mixing conditions such as high shear
and elevated temperature can allow to optimize the final
filler morphology. Thus, the starch composite, after
mixing, may be in a shape of one or more of hereinbefore
described forms.</p><p num="0058">It is important to appreciate that the starch, by
itself, is hydrophilic in nature, meaning that it has a
strong tendency to bind or absorb water. Thus, the
moisture content for the starch and/or starch composite has
been previously discussed herein. This is considered to be
an important, or desirable, feature in the practice of this
invention because water can also act somewhat as a
plasticizer with the starch and which can sometimes
associate with the plasticizer itself for the starch
composite such as polyvinyl alcohol and cellulose acetate,
or other plasticizer which contain similar functionalities
such as esters of polyvinyl alcohol and/or cellulose
acetate or any plasticizer which can depress the melting
point of the starch.</p><p num="0059">Various grades of the starch/plasticizer composition
can be developed to be used with various elastomer
compositions and processing conditions.</p><p num="0060">As hereinbefore pointed out, the starch typically has
a softening point in a range of 180°C to 220°C, depending
somewhat upon its ratio of amylose to amylopectin units, as
well as other factors and, thus, does not readily soften
when the rubber is conventionally mixed, for example, at a
temperature in a range of 140°C to 165°C. Accordingly,
after the rubber is mixed, the starch remains in a solid
particulate form, although it may become somewhat elongated
under the higher shear forces generated while the rubber is
being mixed with its compounding ingredients. Thus, the
starch remains largely incompatible with the rubber and is 
typically present in the rubber composition in individual
domains.</p><p num="0061">However, it is now considered herein that providing
starch in a form of a starch composite of starch and a
plasticizer is particularly beneficial in providing such a
composite with a softening point in a range of 110°C to
160°C.</p><p num="0062">The plasticizers can typically be combined with the
starch such as, for example, by appropriate physical mixing
processes, particularly mixing processes that provide
adequate shear force.</p><p num="0063">The combination of starch and, for example, polyvinyl
alcohol or cellulose acetate, is referred to herein as a
"composite". Although the exact mechanism may not be
completely understood, it is believed that the combination
is not a simple mixture but is a result of chemical and/or
physical interactions. It is believed that the
interactions lead to a configuration where the starch
molecules interact via the amylose with the vinyl alcohol,
for example, of the plasticizer molecule to form complexes,
involving perhaps chain entanglements. The large
individual amylose molecules are believed to be
interconnected at several points per molecule with the
individual amylopectin molecules as a result of hydrogen
bonding (which might otherwise also be in the nature of
hydrophilic interactions).</p><p num="0064">This is considered herein to be beneficial because by
varying the content and/or ratios of natural and synthetic
components of the starch/plasticizer composite it is
believed to be possible to alter the balance between
hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between the starch
components and the plasticizer to allow, for example, the
starch composite filler to vary in form from spherical
particles to fibrils.</p><p num="0065">In particular, it is considered herein that adding a
polyvinyl alcohol to the starch to form a composite
thereof, particularly when the polyvinyl alcohol has a 
softening point in a range of 90°C to 130°C, can be
beneficial to provide resulting starch/plasticizer
composite having a softening point in a range of 110°C to
16000, and thereby provide a starch composite for blending
well with a rubber composition during its mixing stage at a
temperature, for example, in a range of 110°C to 165°C or
170°C.</p><p num="0066">In a further aspect of the invention, a tire is
provided having at least one component comprised of the
said starch-based material containing rubber composition of
this invention. Although not limited thereto, such tire
components can be at least one of tread, tread base or
tread undertread, tire innerliner, sidewall apexes, wedges
for the tire shoulder, sidewall, carcass ply and breaker
wire coating rubber compositions, bead insulation rubber
composition and cushion or gumstrips for addition to
various parts of the tire construction. As used herein,
the tread and tread base may be collectively referred to
herein as the "tread", or "circumferential tread". Such
tire components are well known those skilled in such art.</p><p num="0067">As an aspect feature of this invention, a tire is
provided having a circumferential tread component comprised
of the said rubber composition of this invention with the
aforesaid tire component, thus, being its tread. As is
well known to those skilled in such art, such tire tread is
typically designed to be ground-contacting.</p><p num="0068">As a further aspect of this invention, a tire is
provided with sidewall apex components comprised of the
said rubber composition of this invention.</p><p num="0069">As an additional aspect of the invention, a tire is
provided with a sidewall insert component positioned in the
tire sidewall and apart from its bead portion comprised of
the rubber composition of this invention where it might be
desired to modify the physical properties of the tire
sidewall.</p><p num="0070">Historically, the more homogeneous the dispersion of
rubber compound components into the rubber, the better the 
resultant cured properties of that rubber. It is
considered herein that it is a particular feature of this
invention that the starch composite mixes with the rubber
composition during the rubber mixing under high shear
conditions and at a temperature in a range of 140°C to
165°C, in a manner that very good dispersion in the rubber
mixture is obtained. This is considered herein to be
important because upon mixing the elastomer composition
containing the starch/plasticizer composite to a
temperature to reach the melting point temperature of the
composite, the starch composite will contribute to the
development of high shearing forces which is considered to
be beneficial to ingredient dispersion within the rubber
composition. Above the melting point of the starch
composite, for example, around 150°C, it will melt and
maximize its reaction with the coupling agent.</p><p num="0071">In one aspect, such a rubber composition can be
provided as being sulfur cured. The sulfur curing is
accomplished in a conventional manner, namely, by curing
under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure for a
suitable period of time.</p><p num="0072">In the practice of this invention, as hereinbefore
pointed out, the rubber composition is comprised of at
least one diene-based elastomer, or rubber. Thus, it is
considered that the elastomer is a sulfur curable
elastomer. The diene-based elastomer may be selected from
at least one of homopolymers of isoprene and 1,3-butadiene
and copolymers of isoprene and/or 1,3-butadiene with a
aromatic vinyl compound selected from at least one of
styrene and alpha-methylstyrene. Accordingly such
elastomer, or rubber, may be selected, for example, from at
least one of cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural and/or
synthetic, and preferably natural rubber), 3,4-polyisoprene
rubber, styrene/butadiene copolymer rubbers,
isoprene/butadiene copolymer rubbers, styrene/isoprene
copolymer rubbers, styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymer
rubbers, cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber and medium to high 
vinyl polybutadiene rubber having a vinyl 1,2- content in a
range of 15 to 85 percent and emulsion polymerization
prepared butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers. Such medium
to high vinyl polybutadiene rubber may be more simply
referred to herein as a high vinyl polybutadiene.</p><p num="0073">The rubber composition is preferably of at least two
diene-based rubbers.</p><p num="0074">In one aspect, an emulsion polymerization derived
styrene/butadiene (E-SBR) might be used having a relatively
conventional styrene content of 20 to 30 percent bound
styrene or, for some applications, an E-SBR having a medium
to relatively high bound styrene content, namely, a bound
styrene content of 30 to 45 percent.</p><p num="0075">The relatively high styrene content of 30 to 45 for
the E-SBR can be considered beneficial for a purpose of
enhancing traction, or skid resistance, of the tire tread.
The presence of the E-SBR itself is considered beneficial
for a purpose of enhancing processability of the uncured
elastomer composition mixture, especially in comparison to
a utilization of a solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR).</p><p num="0076">By emulsion polymerization prepared E-SBR, it is meant
that styrene and 1,3-butadiene are copolymerized as an
aqueous emulsion. Such are well known to those skilled in
such art. The bound styrene content can vary, for example,
from 5 to 50%.</p><p num="0077">Emulsion polymerization prepared
styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubbers (E-SBAR)
containing 2 to 50 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in
the terpolymer are also contemplated as diene-based rubbers
for use in this invention.</p><p num="0078">The solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR)
typically has a bound styrene content in a range of 5 to
50, preferably 9 to 36, percent. Its' butadiene portion
may have a vinyl content in a range of 10 to 50 percent.
The S-SBR can be conveniently prepared, for example, by
organo lithium catalyzation in the presence of an organic 
hydrocarbon solvent.</p><p num="0079">A purpose of using S-SBR is to enhance tire rolling
resistance since it should tend to promote lower hysteresis
for tire tread compositions.</p><p num="0080">The 3,4-polyisoprene rubber (3,4-PI) is considered
beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tire's traction
when it is used in a tire tread composition.</p><p num="0081">The 3,4-PI and use thereof is more fully described in
US-A- 5,087,668. The Tg refers to the glass transition
temperature which can conveniently be determined by a
differential scanning calorimeter at a heating rate of 10°C
per minute.</p><p num="0082">The cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber (BR) is considered to
be beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tire tread's
wear, or treadwear.</p><p num="0083">Such BR can be prepared, for example, by organic
solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene.</p><p num="0084">The BR may be conveniently characterized, for example,
by having at least a 90% cis 1,4-content.</p><p num="0085">The cis 1,4-polyisoprene and cis 1,4-polyisoprene
natural rubber are well known to those having skill in the
rubber art.</p><p num="0086">The commonly-employed siliceous pigments used in
rubber compounding applications can be used as the silica
in this invention, including pyrogenic and precipitated
siliceous pigments (silica), although precipitate silicas
are preferred.</p><p num="0087">Amorphous silicas preferably employed in this
invention are precipitated silicas such as, for example,
those obtained by the acidification of a soluble silicate,
e.g., sodium silicate. Such precipitated silicas are
intended to include aluminosilicates.</p><p num="0088">Such silicas might be characterized, for example, by
having a BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas,
preferably in the range of 40 to 600, and more usually in a
range of 50 to 300 square meters per gram. The BET method
of measuring surface area is described in the <u style="single">Journal of</u><u style="single">the American Chemical Society</u>, Volume 60, page 304 (1930).</p><p num="0089">The silica may also be typically characterized by
having a dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range
of 50 to 400 cm<sup>3</sup>/100g, and more usually 100 to 300
cm<sup>3</sup>/100g.</p><p num="0090">Various commercially available silicas may be
considered for use in this invention such as, only for
example herein, and without limitation, silicas
commercially available from PPG Industries under the Hi-Sil
trademark with designations 210, 243, etc; silicas
available from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for example, Zeosil
1165MP and silicas available from Degussa AG with, for
example, designations VN2 and VN3, as well as other grades
of silica, particularly precipitated silicas, which can be
used for elastomer reinforcement.</p><p num="0091">The amorphous silicas are conventionally used in
conjunction with a coupling agent and it is intended herein
that the coupling agent may be also be reactive with
starch-based materials used for this invention,
particularly with hydroxyl groups of the starch based
materials.</p><p num="0092">While various coupling agents may be used, a variety
of coupling agents is a coupling agent is comprised of a
bis (3-trialkoxysilylalkyl) polysulfide wherein said alkyl
groups for the trialkoxy component are selected from methyl
and ethyl radicals, wherein said alkyl group for said
silylalkyl component is selected from ethyl, propyl and
butyl radicals and wherein the polysulfide bridge contains
an average of 2.2 to 4 connecting sulfur atoms.</p><p num="0093">Exemplary of such coupling agent is a bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)
polysulfide where the polysulfide
bridge contains an average of from 2.2 to 4 and
particularly an average of from 2.2 to 2.6, (a disulfide
material), or an average of from 3.4 to 4, (a tetrasulfide
material),4 sulfur atoms in its polysulfide bridge.</p><p num="0094">It is readily understood by those having skill in the
art that the rubber composition would be compounded by 
methods generally known in the rubber compounding art, such
as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent
rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such
as, for example, curing aids, such as sulfur, activators,
retarders and accelerators, processing additives, such as
oils, resins including tackifying resins, silicas, and
plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide,
waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants, peptizing agents and
reinforcing materials such as, for example, carbon black.
As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the
intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur
vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned
above are selected and commonly used in conventional
amounts.</p><p num="0095">Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise
0.5 to 10 phr, usually 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of
processing aids comprise 1 to 50 phr. Such processing aids
can include, for example, aromatic, napthenic, and/or
paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of
antioxidants comprise 1 to 5 phr. Representative
antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine
and others, such as, for example, those
disclosed in <u style="single">The Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook</u> (1978), pages
344-346. Typical amounts of antiozonants comprise 1 to 5
phr. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can
include stearic acid comprise 0.5 to 3 phr. Typical
amounts of zinc oxide comprise 1 to 10 phr. Typical
amounts of waxes comprise 1 to 5 phr. Often
microcrystalline waxes are used. Typical amounts of
peptizers comprise 0.1 to 1 phr.</p><p num="0096">The vulcanization is conducted in the presence of a
sulfur vulcanizing agent. Examples of suitable sulfur
vulcanizing agents include elemental sulfur (free sulfur)
or sulfur donating vulcanizing agents, for example, an
amine disulfide, polymeric polysulfide or sulfur olefin
adducts. Preferably, the sulfur vulcanizing agent is
elemental sulfur. As known to those skilled in the art, 
sulfur vulcanizing agents are used in an amount ranging
from 0.5 to 4 phr, or even, in some circumstances, up to 8
phr.</p><p num="0097">Accelerators are used to control the time and/or
temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the
properties of the vulcanizate. In one embodiment, a single
accelerator system may be used, i.e., primary accelerator.
Conventionally and preferably, a primary accelerator(s) is
used in total amounts ranging from 0.5 to 4, preferably 0.8
to 1.5, phr. In another embodiment, combinations of a
primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the
secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts (of
0.05 to 3 phr) in order to activate and to improve the
properties of the vulcanizate. Combinations of these
accelerators might be expected to produce a synergistic
effect on the final properties and are somewhat better than
those produced by use of either accelerator alone. In
addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are
not affected by normal processing temperatures but produce
a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures.
Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types
of accelerators that may be used in the present invention
are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles,
thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates.
Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a
second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is
preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram
compound.</p><p num="0098">The presence and relative amounts of the above
additives are not considered to be an aspect of the present
invention which is more primarily directed to the
utilization of specified blends of rubbers in rubber
compositions, in combination with various starch, modified
starch and starch/plasticizer composite and methylene donor
and/or methylene acceptor compounds in various rubber
compositions.</p><p num="0099">The mixing of the rubber composition can be 
accomplished by methods known to those having skill in the
rubber mixing art. For example, the ingredients are
typically mixed in at least two stages, namely, at least
one non-productive stage followed by a productive mix
stage. The final curatives are typically mixed in the
final stage which is conventionally called the "productive"
mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a
temperature, or ultimate temperature, lower than the mix
temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive mix
stage(s). The rubber, starch-based material, and fillers
such as carbon black and optional silica and coupler,
and/or non-carbon black and non-silica fillers, are mixed
in one or more non-productive mix stages. The terms "non-productive"
and "productive" mix stages are well known to
those having skill in the rubber mixing art.</p><p num="0100">The rubber composition of this invention can be used
for various purposes. For example, it can be used for
various tire compounds. Such tires can be built, shaped,
molded and cured by various methods which are known and
will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0101">The invention may be better understood by reference to
the following examples in which the parts and percentages
are by weight unless otherwise indicated.</p><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLE I</u></heading><p num="0102">In this Example, three fillers are utilized in a
