More specifically, the present invention relates to selective Î².sub.3 adrenergic receptor agonists useful in the treatment of Type II diabetes and obesity.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The current preferred treatment for Type II, non-insulin dependent diabetes as well as obesity is diet and exercise, with a view toward weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. Patient compliance, however, is usually poor. There are no currently approved medications that adequately treat either Type II diabetes or obesity. The invention described herein is directed toward an effective and timely treatment for these serious diseases.</p><p>One therapeutic opportunity that has been recently recognized involves the relationship between adrenergic receptor stimulation, anti-hyperglycemic effects, and metabolic events such as increased basil metabolic rate. Compounds that act as Î².sub.3 adrenergic receptor agonists have been shown to exhibit a marked effect on lipolysis, thermogenesis, and serum glucose levels in animal models of Type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes.</p><p>The Î².sub.3 receptor, which is found in several types of human tissue including human fat tissue, has roughly 50% homology to the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptor subtypes yet is considerably less abundant. The importance of the Î².sub.3 receptor is a relatively recent discovery since the amino-acid sequence of the human receptor was only elucidated in the late 1980's. A large number of publications have appeared in recent years reporting success in discovery of agents that stimulate the Î².sub.3 receptor. Despite these recent developments there remains a need to develop a selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonist which has minimal agonist activity against the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors.</p><p>The present invention provides methods of treating Type II diabetes, treating obesity, and stimulating the Î².sub.3 receptor. In addition, the present invention also provides novel compounds that are selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonists and as such are useful for treating Type II diabetes, obesity, and stimulating the Î².sub.3 receptor. U.S. Pat.

As they relate to the present invention, the terms below may not be interpreted, individually or collectively, to describe chemical structures that are unstable or impossible to construct.</p><p>The term "halo" represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine.</p><p>The term "C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl" represents a cyclo, straight or branched chain alkyl group having from one to four carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl and the like. A "haloalkyl" is one such alkyl substituted with one or more halo atoms, preferably one to three halo atoms. An example of a haloalkyl is trifluoromethyl. An "alkoxy" is a alkyl group covalently bonded by an --O-- linkage.</p><p>The term "1 to 5 carbon straight or branched alkylene" represents a one to five carbon, straight or branched, alkylene moiety. A branched alkylene may have one or more points of branching. A 1 to 5 carbon straight or branched alkylene may optionally be unsaturated at one or more carbons. Thus, a 1 to 5 carbon straight or branched alkylene includes 1 to 5 carbon alkylene, alkenylene and alkylidene moieties. Examples include methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, --CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)CH.sub.2 --, --CH(CH.sub.3)CH(CH.sub.3)--, --CH.sub.2 C(CH.sub.3).sub.2 --, --CH.sub.2 CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 --, --C(CH.sub.3).sub.2 CHâ, --CHâCHCH.sub.2 --, --CHâCH--, and the like.</p><p>The "acyl" moiety, alone or in combination, is derived from an alkanoic acid containing from one to seven carbon atoms. The term "acyl" also includes moieties derived from an aryl carboxylic acid.</p><p>The term "aryl" represents an optionally substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl. The term (CH.sub.2).sub.n aryl is preferably benzyl or phenyl.</p><p>The term "optionally substituted" or "substituted" as used herein means an optional substitution of one to three, preferably one or two groups independently selected from halo, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 haloalkyl, hydroxy, carboxy, tetrazolyl, acyl, COOR.sub.2, CONR.sub.11 R.sub.12, CONH(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxy), cyano, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxy, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, nitro, NR.sub.11 R.sub.12, NHCO(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), NHCO(benzyl), NHCO(phenyl), SR.sub.2, S(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), OCO(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), SO.sub.2 (NR.sub.11 R.sub.12), SO.sub.2 (C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), or SO.sub.2 (phenyl).</p><p>R.sub.2 is independently hydrogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, or aryl.</p><p>R.sub.11 and R.sub.12 are independently H, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, or combine with the nitrogen to which each is bound to form morpholinyl, piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, or piperazinyl.</p><p>The term "heterocycle" represents a stable, optionally substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated 5 or 6 membered ring, said ring having from one to four heteroatoms that are the same or different and that are selected from the group consisting of sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen; and when heterocycle contains two adjacent carbon atoms, the adjacent carbon atoms may be structured to form a group of the formula --CHâCH--; provided that (1) when the heterocyclic ring contains 5 members, the heteroatoms comprise not more than two sulfur or two oxygen atoms but not both; and (2) when the heterocyclic ring contains 6 members and is aromatic, sulfur and oxygen are not present. The heterocycle may be attached at any carbon or nitrogen which affords a stable structure. The heterocycle may be optionally substituted. Examples of a heterocycle include but are not limited to pyrazole, pyrazoline, imidazole, isoxazole, triazole, tetrazole, oxazole, 1,3-dioxolone, thiazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, piperazine, morpholine, pyrazine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, oxazolidone, oxazolidinedione, imidazolidinone, and the like.</p><p>The term "leaving group" as used in the specification is understood by those skilled in the art. Generally, a leaving group is any group or atom that enhances the electrophilicity of the atom to which it is attached for displacement. Preferred leaving groups are p-nitrobenzene sulfonate, triflate, mesylate, tosylate, imidate, chloride, bromide, and iodide.</p><p>The term "pharmaceutically effective amount", as used herein, represents an amount of a compound of the invention that is capable of stimulating the Î².sub.3 receptor in mammals. The particular dose of the compound administered according to this invention will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the patient, including the compound administered, the route of administration, the particular condition being treated, and similar considerations.</p><p>The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.</p><p>The term "treating," as used herein, describes the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating the disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of a compound of present invention to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications, to alleviate the symptoms or complications, or to eliminate the disease, condition, or disorder.</p><p>The term "selective" means preferential agonism or stimulation of the Î².sub.3 receptor over agonism of the Î².sub.1 or Î².sub.2 receptor. In general, the compounds demonstrate a minimum of a twenty fold differential (preferably over a 50 required to behave as an agonist to the Î².sub.3 receptor and the dosage required for equal agonism of the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors as measured in the Functional Agonist Assay. The compounds demonstrate this differential across the range of doses. Thus, Î².sub.3 selective compounds behave as agonists for the Î².sub.3 receptor at much lower concentrations with lower toxicity by virtue of their minimal agonism of the other receptors.</p><p>The term "stimulating", as used herein, means affecting, activating, or agonizing the Î².sub.3 receptor to elicit a pharmacological response. The stimulation or activation of the receptor may be either complete or partial relative to a known stimulating agent such as isoproterenol.</p><p>As previously noted, the present invention provides a method of treating type II diabetes and obesity, comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof compounds of the Formula I.</p><p>Preferred embodiments of the present invention are set out in paragraphs below. ##STR10## (m) X.sub.1 is --OCH.sub.2 --, the oxygen of which is attached to R.sub.1.

The reaction of Scheme I is carried out under conditions appreciated in the art for the amination of epoxides. For example, the epoxide (A) may be combined with the amine (B) in an alcohol, such as ethanol, at room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably, the reaction is carried out under conditions generally described in Atkins et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 27:2451 (1986). These conditions include mixing the reagents in the presence of trimethylsilyl acetamide in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), tetrahydrofuran (THF), or other polar aprotic solvents in which the reagents are soluble. Preferably, the solvent is DMSO. The reaction is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 0</p><p>Expoxides utilized in scheme I can be prepared by methods well known in the art, or according to Scheme III from starting material known in the art.</p><p>Certain compounds of the present invention are prepared by a novel combinatorial/parallel synthesis. This synthesis is described in Scheme II. ##STR14##</p><p>In Scheme II, X.sub.1, X.sub.2, R.sub.1, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 have the same meaning as previously described and R.sub.6 is hydrogen. The reaction of Scheme II is preferably carried out by adding to a glass vial: a non-reactive solvent such as methanol, DMF, methylene chloride or acetonitrile, amine (IV), and ketone (V). The solution is shaken to allow for imine formation and treated with Amberlite IRA400 borohydride resin (Aldrich Chemicals). The slurry is then shaken an additional 24 hours to effect reduction to the secondary amine. Methylene chloride and polystyrene-linked benzaldehyde resin (Frechet, J. M. et al., J. Am Chem. Soc. 93:492 (1971)) is added to the vial, in order to scavenge excess primary amine starting material. The slurry is shaken, preferably overnight.

Membranes were incubated in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.2% BSA, 2.6 mM Mg, 0.8 mM ATP, 0.1 mM GTP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, creatine kinase 50 U/mL, 0.2 mM IBMX at 32 Agonists were added and incubation continued for 15 m. cAMP produced was assayed using a fluorescent tracer-immuno assay method.</p><p>Intact cell assays were performed using suspended cells removed from culture flasks by trypsin treatment. Cells were preincubated with 0.5 mM IBMX at 37 min. Incubation was stopped by heating suspension in boiling water. cAMP or cGMP in these and the soleus incubations were assayed by RIA (Amersham).</p><p>The compounds of the invention are agonists of the Î².sub.3 receptor. Isoproterenol is accepted in the art as a non-selective Î².sub.3 agonist and is widely used as a comparator in evaluating the activity of compounds. See Trends in Pharm. Sci. 15: 3 (1994). In the Functional Agonist Î².sub.3 assay, the compounds demonstrated at least 30%, preferably 50% and most preferably over 85% of isoproterenol's response at a single dose of 50 mmol. Dose response titrations on the agonists described reveal EC.sub.50 values of &amp;lt;10 mM, preferably &amp;lt;1 mmol. In the functional assay, dose titration furnishes an EC.sub.50 for isoproterenol of 1.1.+-î5 Î¼M.</p><p>When screened against the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors in the functional assay, dose titration experiments indicate that greatly reduced or no receptor stimulation is observed with the compounds of the invention. This is defined by measuring the intrinsic activity (maximal response achieved) as compared to isoproterenol. The claimed compounds of Formula I are selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonists and have an intrinsic activity of &amp;lt;3% of isoproterenol's response.</p><p>Thus, the compounds of the invention are selective Î².sub.3 agonists.</p><p>As agonists of Î².sub.3, the compounds are useful in treating conditions in a mammal in which the Î².sub.3 receptor has been demonstrated to have a role in pathology. The preferred mammal is a human. The relationship between modulating the Î².sub.3 receptor and treatment of diseases, such Type II diabetes and obesity, is well established in the art. Other conditions recognized in the art include: gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal motility, asthma, depression, prostate disease and dyslipidema. Thus, the present compounds are useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, non-specific diarrhoea and dumping syndrome.</p><p>In addition, administration of compounds of the present invention can result in normalization of insulin and glucose levels in patients requiring such normalization. Therefore, the present invention would be useful in treating hyperglycemia. The present invention would also be useful for increasing metabolic rate and enhancing a patients sensitivity to insulin.</p><p>In treating non-human mammals, the compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing weight gain and/or improving the feed utilization efficiency and/or weight gain and/or improving the feed utilization efficiency and/or increasing lean body mass and/or decreasing birth mortality rate and increasing post/natal survival rate of livestock.</p><p>The compounds of Formula I are preferably formulated prior to administration. Therefore, yet another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula I and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.</p><p>The present pharmaceutical formulations are prepared by known procedures using well-known and readily available ingredients. In making the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semisolid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosol (as a solid or in a liquid medium), soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.</p><p>Some examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient.</p><p>The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 0.1 to about 500 mg, more usually about 0.5 to about 200 mg, of the active ingredient. However, it will be understood that the therapeutic dosage administered will be determined by the physician in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound to be administered and the chosen route of administration, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, topical, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes. For all indications, a typical daily dose will contain from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg of the active compound of this invention. Preferred daily doses will be about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, ideally about 0.1 to about 5 mg/kg. However, for topical administration a typical dosage is about 1 to about 500 mg compound per cm.sup.2 of an affected tissue. Preferably, the applied amount of compound will range from about 30 to about 300 mg/cm.sup.2, more preferably, from about 50 to about 200 mg/cm.sup.2, and, most preferably, from about 60 to about 100 mg/cm.sup.2.</p><p>The following formulation examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.</p><heading>Formulation 1</heading><p>Hard gelatin capsules are prepared using the following ingredients:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________         Quantity  (mg/capsule)______________________________________Active ingredient           25  starch, dried 425  magnesium stearate 10  Total 460 mg______________________________________</pre></p><p>The above ingredients are mixed and filled into hard gelatin capsules in 460 mg quantities.</p><p>The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification.
