More particularly, the present invention relates to a vapor-phase carbonylation catalyst having a solid-phase component which includes platinum and tin associated with a solid support material and at least one vaporous halide promoter component. The carbonylation catalyst is particularly useful for the production of acetic acid, methyl acetate and mixtures thereof from methanol, dimethyl ether and methyl ester and ester-alcohol mixtures.</p><p num="p0004">BACKGROUND ART Lower carboxylic acids and esters such as acetic acid and methyl acetate have been known as industrial chemicals for many years. Acetic acid is used in the manufacture of a variety of intermediary and end-products. For example, an important derivative is vinyl acetate which can be used as monomer or co-monomer for a variety of polymers. Acetic acid itself is used as a solvent in the production of terephthalic acid, which is widely used in the container industry, and particularly in the formation of PET beverage containers. There has been considerable research activity in the use of metal catalysts for the carbonylation of lower alkyl alcohols, such as methanol, and ethers to their corresponding carboxylic acids and esters, as illustrated in equations 1-3 below:</p><p num="p0005">ROH + CO → RCOOH (1) 2ROH + CO -&gt; RCOOR + water (2)</p><p num="p0006">ROR' + CO - RCOOR (3)</p><p num="p0007">Carbonylation of methanol is a well known reaction and is typically carried out in the liquid phase with a catalyst. A thorough review of these commercial processes and other approaches to accomplishing the formation of acetyl from a single carbon source is described by Howard et al. in Catalysis Today, 18, 325-354 (1993). Generally, the liquid phase carbonylation reactions for the preparation of acetic acid using methanol are performed using homogeneous catalyst systems comprising a Group VIII metal and a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
halogen component such as iodine or bromine or an iodine or bromine-containing compound such as hydrogen iodide, hydrogen bromide, methyl iodide, or methyl bromide. Rhodium is the most common Group VIII metal catalyst and methyl iodide is the most common promoter. These reactions are conducted in the presence of water to prevent precipitation of the catalyst.</p><p num="p0008">These recently developed processes represent a distinct improvement over the classic carbonylation processes wherein such feed materials have been previously carbonylated in the presence of such catalyst systems as phosphoric acid, phosphates, activated carbon, heavy metal salts and metal carbonyls such as cobalt carbonyl, iron carbonyl and nickel carbonyl. All of these previously known processes require the use of extremely high partial pressures of carbon monoxide. They also have the disadvantage of requiring higher catalyst concentrations, longer reaction times, and higher temperatures to obtain substantial reaction and conversion rates. This results in needing larger and more costly processing equipment and higher manufacturing costs. A disadvantage of a homogeneous phase carbonylation process is that additional steps are necessary for separating the products from the catalyst solutions, and there are always handling losses of the catalyst. Losses of the metal in the catalyst can be attributed to several factors, such as the plating-out of the active metal onto piping and process equipment thereby rendering the metal inactive for carbonylation purposes and losses due to incomplete separation of the catalyst from the products. These losses of the metal component are costly because the metals themselves are very expensive.</p><p num="p0009">Schultz, in U.S. Patent 3,689,533, discloses using a supported rhodium catalyst for the carbonylation of alcohols to form carboxylic acids in a vapor-phase reaction.

EP 0 759 419 Al discloses a carbonylation process comprising a first carbonylation reactor wherein an alcohol is carbonylated in the liquid phase in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst system and the off gas from this first reactor is then mixed with additional alcohol and fed to a second reactor containing a supported catalyst. The homogeneous catalyst system utilized in the first reactor comprises a halogen component and a Group VIII metal selected from rhodium and iridium. When the Group VIII metal is iridium, the homogeneous catalyst system also may contain an optional co-promoter selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, osmium, rhenium, cadmium, mercury, zinc, indium and gallium. The supported catalyst employed in the second reactor comprises a Group VIII metal selected from the group consisting of iridium, rhodium, and nickel, and an optional metal promoter on a carbon support. The optional metal promoter may be iron, nickel, lithium and cobalt. The conditions within the second carbonylation reactor zone are such that mixed vapor and liquid phases are present in the second reactor. The presence of a liquid phase component in the second reactor inevitably leads to leaching of the active metals from the supported catalyst which, in turn, results in a substantial decrease in the activity of the catalyst and costly replacement of the active catalyst component. The literature contains several reports of the use of rhodium-containing zeolites as vapor phase alcohol carbonylation catalysts at one bar pressure in the presence of halide promoters.

 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0020">Briefly, the present invention provides a catalyst useful for the vapor-phase carbonylation of lower alkyl alcohols, lower alkyl alcohol generating compositions such as ether and ester derivatives of the alcohols, and mixtures thereof for producing esters and carboxylic acids. The catalyst includes a first component comprising platinum and/or platinum salt and tin and/or tin salt which are associated with a solid support material and a vaporous component comprising a halide promoter. As used herein the term "associated with" includes any manner that permits the platinum metal and/or its salt and the tin metal and/or its salt to reside on or in the solid support. Non-limiting examples in which the platinum and tin metals or their respective salts may be associated with the solid support include impregnating, immersing, spraying, and coating the support with a solution containing platinum and with a solution containing tin sequentially or impregnating, immersing, spraying, and coating the support with a solution containing a mixture of platinum and tin.</p><p num="p0021">It is an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst useful in a vapor-phase carbonylation process. It is another object of the invention to provide a vapor-phase carbonylation catalyst having platinum or platinum salt and tin or tin salt associated with a solid support material and a vaporous halide promoter component. These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the accompanying detailed description.</p><p num="p0022">MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0023">The catalyst of the present invention is particularly useful for the continuous production of carboxylic acids and esters by reacting lower alkyl alcohols, lower alkyl alcohol generating compositions such as ether and ester derivatives of the alcohols, and mixtures thereof in a vapor-phase carbonylation process. In accordance with the invention, the catalyst has a solid state component which includes platinum and/or platinum salt and tin and/or tin salt associated with a solid support material and a vaporous halide promoter component. Desirably, the support material is inert to the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
carbonylation reaction. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst is particularly useful for vapor-phase carbonylation for producing acetic acid, methyl acetate and mixtures thereof from methanol and its derivatives. Desirably, the vapor-phase carbonylation process is operated at temperatures above the dew point of the reactants and products, i.e., the temperature at which condensation occurs. However, since the dew point is a complex function of dilution (particularly with respect to non-condensable gases such as unreacted carbon monoxide, hydrogen, or inert diluent gas), product composition, and pressure, the process may still be operated over a wide range of temperatures, provided the temperature exceeds the dew point of the reactants and products. In practice, this generally dictates a temperature range of about 100°C to about 500°C, with temperatures of about 100°C to about 350°C being preferred and temperatures of about 150°C to 275°C being particularly useful. ,</p><p num="p0024">As with temperature, the useful pressure range is limited by the dew point of the product mixture. Provided that the reaction is operated at a temperature sufficient to prevent liquefaction of the reactants and products, a wide range of pressures may be used, e.g., pressures in the range of about 0.1 to 100 bars absolute. The process preferably is carried out at a pressure in the range of about 1 to 50 bars absolute, most preferably, about 3 to 30 bar absolute (bara).</p><p num="p0025">Suitable feedstock, i.e., reactants, for carbonylation using the catalyst of the present invention include lower alkyl alcohols, lower alkyl alcohol generating compositions, such as ether and ester derivatives of the alcohols, and mixtures thereof. Non-limiting examples of reactants include alcohols and ethers in which an aliphatic carbon atom is directly bonded to an oxygen atom of either an alcoholic hydroxyl group in the compound or an ether oxygen in the compound and may further include aromatic moieties. Preferably, the feedstock is one or more lower alkyl alcohols having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and preferably having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkane polyols having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, alkyl alkylene polyethers having 3 to 20 carbon atoms and alkoxyalkanols having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The most preferred reactant is methanol. Although methanol is preferably used in the process and is normally fed as methanol, it can be supplied in the form of a combination of materials which generate methanol. Examples of such combination of materials include (i) methyl acetate and water and (ii) dimethyl 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
ether and water. In the operation of the process, both methyl acetate and dimethyl ether are formed within the reactor and, unless methyl acetate is the desired product, they are recycled with water to the reactor where they are later consumed to form acetic acid. Accordingly, one skilled in the art will further recognize that it is possible to utilize the catalyst of the present invention produce a carboxylic acid from an ester feed material. Although the presence of water in the gaseous feed mixture is not essential when using methanol, the presence of some water is desirable to suppress formation of methyl acetate and/or dimethyl ether. When using methanol to generate acetic acid, the molar ratio of water to methanol can be 0:1 to 10:1, but preferably is in the range of 0.01:1 to 1:1. When using an alternative source of methanol such as methyl acetate or dimethyl ether, the amount of water fed usually is increased to account for the mole of water required for hydrolysis of the methanol alternative. Accordingly, when using either methyl acetate or dimethyl ether, the mole ratio of water to ester or ether is in the range of 1 : 1 to 10: 1 , but preferably in the range of 1 : 1 to 3 : 1. In the preparation of acetic acid, it is apparent that combinations of methanol, methyl ester, and/or dimethyl ether are equivalent, provided the appropriate amount of water is added to hydrolyze the ether or ester to provide the methanol reactant.</p><p num="p0026">When the methyl ester, methyl acetate, is the desired product, no water should be added to the carbonylation process and dimethyl ether becomes the preferred feedstock. Further, when methanol is used as the feedstock in the preparation of methyl acetate, it is necessary to remove water. However, the primary utility of the process of the present invention is in the manufacture of acetic acid.</p><p num="p0027">In the practice of a vapor-phase carbonylation process, the reactant, in the vapor phase, is passed through or over the solid phase component of the catalyst of the present invention along with the vapor phase halide promoter component of the invention catalyst. The solid phase component of the catalyst includes platinum and tin associated with a substantially inert solid support material.</p><p num="p0028">The form of platinum used to prepare the catalyst generally is not critical. The solid phase component of the catalyst may be prepared from a wide variety of platinum containing compounds and can be in the form of a salt of a mineral acid halide, such as chloroplatinic acid; trivalent nitrogen compounds such as dichlorodiammine platinum; 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
organic compounds of trivalent phosphorous, such as dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine) platinum; olefins, such as dichloro(l,5-cyclooctadiene) platinum; nitriles, such as dichlorobis(benzonitrile) platinum and oxides of platinum may be used if dissolved in the appropriate medium either alone or in combination. The preferred sources of platinum is one of it chlorides, such as any of the various salts of hexachloroplatinate(IV) or a solution of platinum dichloride in either aqueous HC1 or aqueous ammonia.</p><p num="p0029">The amount of platinum, as metal, on the support can vary from about 0.01 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, with from about 0.1 weight percent to about 2 weight percent platinum being preferred based on the total weight of the solid supported catalyst. The form of tin used to prepare the catalyst generally is not critical. The solid phase component of the catalyst may be prepared from a wide variety of tin containing compounds. Suitable tin compounds include tin halides such as tin (II) chloride; alkyl carboxylate salts and aryl carboxylate salts wherein the alkyl group has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and the aryl group has from 6 to 24 carbon atoms wherein at least one of the carbon atoms is bound to the tin moiety, tin oxides such as tin (II) oxalate, and mixtures of such tin containing compounds. The preferred sources of tin materials for use in this invention, based on their availability, cost, lower toxicity, and high solubility in water (the preferred solvent medium) are tin (II) chloride, preferably dissolved in aqueous HC1, and tin (II) oxalate. The content of tin, as metal, on the support can vary over a wide range, for example from about 0.01 to 10 weight percent tin based on the total weight of the solid supported catalyst. However, the preferred amount of tin in the catalyst is from about 0.1 to 5 weight percent of tin based on the total weight of the solid supported catalyst.</p><p num="p0030">Another advantage of the present invention is that platinum and tin are less volatile and less soluble when compared to other active catalysts, such as lr and Rh, and therefore are less likely to be removed from the catalyst support during operation of the carbonylation process. Surprisingly, the combination of platinum and tin demonstrate catalytic activity for vapor-phase carbonylation of lower alkyl alcohols, ether derivatives of the alcohols, ester derivatives of the alcohols, and ester-alcohol mixtures for producing esters and carboxylic acids without the presence of rhodium. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 The solid support useful for acting as a carrier for the platinum and tin consists of a porous solid of such size that it can be employed in fixed or fluidized bed reactors. Typical support materials have a size of from about 400 mesh per inch to about Vz inch. Preferably, the support is carbon, including activated carbon, having a high surface area. Activated carbon is well known in the art and may be derived from coal or peat having a density of from about 0.03 grams/cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) to about 2.25 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The carbon can have a surface area of from about 200 square meters/gram (m<sup>2</sup>/g) to about 1200 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Other solid support materials, which may be used in accordance with the present invention, include pumice, alumina, silica, silica-alumina, magnesia, diatomaceous earth, bauxite, titania, zirconia, clays, magnesium silicate, silicon carbide, zeolites, and ceramics. The shape of the solid support is not particularly important and can be regular or irregular and include extrudates, rods, balls, broken pieces and the like disposed within the reactor.</p><p num="p0031"><sup>•</sup> The platinum and tin can be associated with the solid support by solubilizing the metals, or their respective salts, in a suitable solvent and contacting the solubilized platinum and tin with the solid support material. The solvent is then evaporated so that at least a portion of the platinum and tin is associated with the solid support. Drying temperatures can range from about 100°C to about 600°C for a period greater than about one second. One skilled in the art will understand that the drying time is dependent upon the temperature, humidity, and solvent. Generally, lower temperatures require longer heating periods to effectively evaporate the solvent from the solid support. The method of preparing the solid component of the catalyst optionally further includes the step of heating the solid supported platinum and tin in a stream of inert gas. Non-limiting examples of suitable inert gases include nitrogen, argon and helium Alternatively the platinum and tin can be associated with the solid support by sequentially associating each metal with a support material. For example, platinum or a platinum containing salt would be solubilized using a suitable solvent. The dissolved metal solution would then be contacted with the support material. Afterwards, the solvent is evaporated so that at least a portion of the platinum is associated with the solid support material. Next, tin or a tin containing salt would be associated with the support material following a similar procedure as described for associating the platinum with the solid
