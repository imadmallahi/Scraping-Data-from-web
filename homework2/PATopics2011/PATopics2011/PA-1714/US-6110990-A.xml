Further, these antifouling coating compositions are excellent in storage stability.</p></abstract><description lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><?description-type Brief Summary?><heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p>The present invention relates to an antifouling coating composition, a coating film formed from this antifouling coating composition, an antifouling method using the antifouling coating composition and a hull or an underwater structure coated with the above coating film.</p><p>More particularly, the present invention is concerned with an antifouling coating composition which enables providing a coating film being excellent in cracking resistance and having self-polishing properties such that the adherence of aquatic organism to ship bottoms, underwater structures, fishing nets, etc. can effectively prevented and is further concerned with a coating film formed from this antifouling coating composition, an antifouling method using the antifouling coating composition and a hull or an underwater structure coated with the above coating film.</p><p>Moreover, the present invention is concerned with an antifouling coating composition capable of forming a coating film with excellent strength, especially, a coating film being excellent in cracking and peeling resistances in an environment in which dry and wet conditions alternate with each other (zone under alternate dry and wet), for example, being excellent in cracking and peeling resistances at water lines of ships or in the vicinity of underwater structure drafts where immersion in the seawater and exposure to the air alternate with each other (zone under alternate dry and wet), and is further concerned with a coating film formed from this antifouling coating composition, an antifouling method using the antifouling coating composition and a hull or an underwater structure coated with the above coating film.</p><heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading><p>Ship bottoms, underwater structures, fishing nets and the like are likely to have their appearance and function damaged by the adhesion to surface and propagation of various aquatic organisms including animals such as shellfishes and barnacles, seaweeds such as laver and bacteria caused when they are exposed to the water for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>In particular, when the above aquatic organism adheres to a ship's bottom and propagates, the danger is highly probable that the roughness of the entire surface of the ship is increased to thereby lower the speed of the ship and increase the fuel consumed by the ship. Removing the aquatic organism from the ship bottom necessitates spending of much labor and working time at a dock. Further, when bacteria adhere to, for example, an underwater structure and propagates to thereby cause adhesion of slime (sludgy matter), there is the danger that the slime putrefies to thereby cause damages such as deterioration of the properties of the underwater structure and thus marked shortening of the life thereof.</p><p>For example, a composition comprising a copolymer of tributyltin methacrylate and methyl methacrylate and cuprous oxide (Cu.sub.2 O) has been used as an antifouling paint effectively applicable to ship bottoms for enabling the prevention of the above damages. This copolymer of the antifouling paint is hydrolyzed in the seawater to thereby liberate organotin compounds such as bistributyltin oxide (tributyltin ether of the formula Bu.sub.3 Sn--O--SnBu.sub.3 wherein Bu is a butyl group) and tributyltin halides (Bu.sub.3 SnX wherein X is a halogen atom), so that antifouling effect is exerted. Moreover, the copolymer hydrolyzate per se is a hydrolyzable self-polishing paint which is water-soluble and thus is dissolved in the seawater, so that no resin residue is left on the surface of the ship bottom coating to thereby enable continually maintaining active surface.</p><p>However, the above organotin compounds are so highly toxic that apprehensions are being entertained with respect to marine pollution, occurrence of anomalous fish and adverse effects on ecosystem through food chain. Therefore, the development of an antifouling paint not containing tin is desired as a substitute therefor.</p><p>For example, antifouling paints based on silyl esters as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. 4(1992)-264170, 4(1992)-264169 and 4(1992)-264168 can be mentioned as the above antifouling paint not containing tin. However, these antifouling paints have problems that not only are their antifouling capabilities poor but also cracking and peeling are likely to occur as pointed out in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. 6(1994)-157941 and 6(1994)-157940.</p><p>Further, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2(1990)-196869 teaches an antifouling paint comprising a copolymer with blocked acid functionality (A) which is obtained by copolymerizing trimethylsilyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate and methoxyethyl acrylate in the presence of an azo initiator and which contains carboxyl groups blocked with trimethylsilyl groups and a polyvalent cation compound (B). Also, an antifouling paint comprising a chlorinated paraffin plasticizer in addition to the above acid-functional copolymer (A) and polyvalent cation compound (B) is disclosed in the Example portion of the publication. However, the coating film obtained from the antifouling paint disclosed in the above Example portion has a drawback in that the cracking resistance thereof is not fully satisfactory. That is, in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2(1990)-196869, there is no description teaching what antifouling paint is excellent in cracking resistance and storage stability, especially, cracking resistance.</p><p>Published Japanese Translation of PCT Patent Applications from Other States, No. 60(1985)-500452 and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 63(1988)-215780 describe a resin for antifouling paint which is obtained by copolymerizing a vinyl monomer having an organosilyl group, such as a trialkylsilyl ester of (meth)acrylic acid, with another vinyl monomer and which has a number average molecular weight of 3000 to 40,000 and further describe that the resin can be blended with an organic water binder such as trimethyl orthoformate, an antifouling agent such as cuprous oxide and a pigment such as red iron oxide. However, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 6(1994)-157940, this resin for antifouling paint has drawbacks in that it is likely to gel during the storage thereof and that the coating film formed from the antifouling paint is poor in cracking and peeling resistances.</p><p>Japanese Patent Publication No. 5(1993)-32433 corresponding to the above Published Japanese Translation of PCT Patent Applications from Other States, No. 60(1985)-500452 discloses an antifouling paint comprising a poison (a) and a polymer binder (b) having a repeating unit of the formula (--CH.sub.2 --CXCOOR)--(B)-- wherein X is H or CH.sub.3, R is SiR'.sub.3 or Si(OR').sub.3 in which R' is an alkyl group, etc. and B is an ethylenically unsaturated monomer residue, which polymer binder has a specified hydrolysis rate, and describes that the paint can contain a solvent, a water-sensitive pigment component, an inert pigment, a filler and a retarder.

R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are the same as or different from each other. Examples of suitable trialkylsilyl esters include trialkylsilyl esters in which all R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 groups are identical with each other, such as trimethylsilyl (meth)acrylate, triethylsilyl (meth)acrylate, tripropylsilyl (meth)acrylate, and tributylsilyl (meth)acrylate and further include trialkylsilyl esters in which the R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 groups partially or entirely different from each other, such as dimethylpropylsilyl (meth)acrylate, monomethyldipropylsilyl (meth)acrylate and methylethylpropylsilyl (meth)acrylate.</p><p>In the present invention, the above trialkylsilyl esters may be used singly or in combination. Among the above trialkylsilyl esters, those of which at least one of the R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 alkyl groups has at least 3 carbon atoms are preferred, and those of which all the R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 alkyl groups each have at least 4 carbon atoms are especially preferred. Further, it is particularly preferred to employ those of which the total of the carbon atoms of the R.sup.2, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 alkyl groups ranges from about 5 to 21. Among them, the use of tributylsilyl (meth)acrylate is most especially preferred from the viewpoint of the easiness of trialkylsilyl ester synthesis and the easiness of control of the film forming property, storage stability and grittability of the antifouling coating composition based on the trialkylsilyl ester.</p><p>Any arbitrary polymerizable unsaturated compound (ethylenically unsaturated monomer) can be used as a monomer (comonomer) employed in the copolymerization with the above trialkylsilyl ester.

Therefore, it is desired that no carboxylic acid residue be present in the copolymer. Thus, in the synthesis of the copolymer, it is preferred to employ a highly purified monomer which contains no carboxylic acid residue.</p><p>The film forming copolymer may comprise structural units derived from a single or a plurality of above trialkylsilyl esters of polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid (trialkylsilyl ester structural units) as mentioned above. It is preferred that the sum of the trialkylsilyl ester structural units contained in the copolymer range from 20 to 65% by weight, especially, from 30 to 55% by weight from the viewpoint that an antifouling coating film being excellent in long-term antifouling properties can be obtained from the concerned antifouling coating composition.</p><p>The number average molecular weight (Mn) measured by GPC of this copolymer ranges from 1000 to 50,000, preferably, from 2000 to 20,000, still preferably, from 2500 to 15,000 and, yet still preferably, from 3000 to 12,000.

However, suitably employed chlorinated paraffins each has an average of, generally, 8 to 30, preferably, 10 to 26 carbon atoms; a number average molecular weight of, generally, 200 to 1200, preferably, 300 to 1100; a viscosity of, generally, at least 1 ps, preferably, at least 1.2 ps at 25 1.70 at 25 number of carbon atoms provides an antifouling coating composition capable of forming a coating film of reduced cracking and peeling. The number of carbon atoms of the chlorinated paraffin is preferably in the range of 8 to 30 from the viewpoint of the crack inhibiting effect, consumability (renewability) of the surface of the coating film and antifouling properties. It is preferred that the chlorination ratio (chlorine content: weight %) of the chlorinated paraffin generally range from 35 to 75%, especially, from 35 to 65%. The use of the chlorinated paraffin of the above chlorination ratio provides an antifouling coating composition capable of forming a coating film of reduced cracking and peeling. The chlorination ratio of the chlorinated paraffin is preferably in the range of 35 to 75% by weight from the viewpoint of miscibility (compatibility) with the film forming copolymer (silyl ester copolymer), crack inhibiting effect, consumability of the surface of the coating film and antifouling properties. Examples of suitable chlorinated paraffins include "TOYOPARAX 150" and "TOYOPRAX A-70" produced by Tosoh Corporation. In the present invention, a plurality of chlorinated paraffins whose chlorine contents and carbon quantities are different from each other can be used in combination. When a plurality of such chlorinated paraffins are used in combination, the above number of carbon atoms and chlorination ratio of the chlorinated paraffin means averages of the respective values of such chlorinated paraffins contained in the antifouling coating composition.</p><p>In the antifouling coating composition comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin, it is preferred that the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of 18 to 65 parts by weight, especially, 20 to 55 parts by weight and, still especially, 20 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of the chlorinated paraffin is in the range of 18 to 65 parts by weight, there can be obtained an excellent crack inhibiting effect on the coating film formed from the concerned antifouling coating composition and an improvement in anti-damage properties (impact resistance).</p><p>When zinc pyrithione is used as the antifouling agent, in the antifouling coating composition comprising zinc pyrithione, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin, it is preferred that the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of 10 to 65 parts by weight, especially, 18 to 55 parts by weight, still especially, 20 to 50 parts by weight and, yet still especially, 20 to 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of the chlorinated paraffin is in the range of 10 to 65 parts by weight, there can be obtained an excellent crack inhibiting effect on the coating film formed from the concerned antifouling coating composition and improvements in the strength of the coating film and anti-damage properties (impact resistance).</p><p>In the antifouling coating composition comprising not only the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin but also the below described dehydrating agent (preferably, inorganic dehydrating agent), it is preferred that the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of 10 to 65 parts by weight, especially, 18 to 55 parts by weight and, still especially, 20 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of the chlorinated paraffin is in the range of 10 to 65 parts by weight, there can be obtained, as in the above case, an excellent crack inhibiting effect on the coating film formed from the concerned antifouling coating composition and improvements of the strength of the coating film and anti-damage properties (impact resistance).</p><heading>Antifouling Agent</heading> <p>The antifouling agent may be either an organic one or an inorganic one and is not particularly limited. Examples of suitable antifouling agents include copper and copper compounds such as cuprous oxide (Cu.sub.2 O), copper powder and cuprous thiocyanate (copper rhodanide); metal pyrithiones represented by the formula: ##STR4## wherein each of R.sub.1 to R.sub.4 independently represents hydrogen, an alkyl, an alkoxy or a halogenated alkyl, M represents a metal such as Zn, Cu, Na, Mg, Ca, Ba, Pb, Fe or Al, and n is a valence, and derivatives thereof; tetramethylthiuram disulfide; carbamate poisons such as zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate and manganese 2-ethylenebisdithiocarbamate; 2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophthalonitrile; N,N-dimethyldichlorophenylurea; 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one; 2,4,6-trichlorophenylmaleimide; and pyridine triphenylborane-cupper rodanide. The use of cuprous oxide is especially preferred. It is preferred that each of antifouling agents other than cuprous oxide be used in combination with cuprous oxide. Zinc salt of 2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide (zinc pyrithione) can be mentioned as a preferred antifouling agent to be used in combination with cuprous oxide.</p><p>These antifouling agents can be used either individually or in combination.</p><p>This antifouling agent is varied in its content depending on the antifouling agent used in the preparation of the antifouling coating composition, the type of the film forming copolymer, the type of ship to which the antifouling coating composition is applied (ships for either overseas voyage or coastwise service, for various sea water areas, either wooden or steel made, etc.), etc. and which content cannot indiscriminately be determined, when the antifouling coating composition is composed of the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin, the antifouling agent is generally used in a total amount of 50 to 1500 parts by weight, preferably, 80 to 1200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer of the antifouling coating composition.</p><p>For example, when the above cuprous oxide is used as the antifouling agent, it may generally be contained in the antifouling coating composition in an amount of about 80 to 1200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>When the antifouling coating composition contains the above zinc pyrithione as the antifouling agent, a coating film having especially high slime resistance can be obtained. It is preferred that the zinc pyrithione be contained in the antifouling coating composition in an amount of, generally, 0.5 to 600 parts by weight, especially, 1.0 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of zinc pyrithione is in the range of 0.5 to 600 parts by weight, there can be obtained an excellent slime resistance and an improvement in the cracking resistance.</p> <p>It is preferred that the zinc pyrithione be contained in the antifouling coating composition in an amount of, generally, 0.1 to 30% by weight, especially, 0.5 to 20% by weight. The slime resistance of the antifouling coating composition containing zinc pyrithione highly depends on the zinc pyrithione content of the antifouling coating composition. When the content is in the range of 0.1 to 30% by weight, an antifouling coating composition being excellent in slime resistance can be obtained and the coating film (antifouling coating film) from the antifouling coating composition applied to ship bottoms is effectively prevented from crack occurrence upon being submerged.</p> <p>The zinc pyrithione and antifouling agent other than zinc pyrithione to be contained in the antifouling coating composition of the present invention is varied in their contents depending on the antifouling agent used in the preparation of the antifouling coating composition, the type of the film forming copolymer, the type of ship to which the antifouling coating composition is applied (ships for either overseas voyage or coastwise service, for various sea water areas, either wooden or steel made, etc.), etc. and which contents cannot indiscriminately be determined. However, for the same reason, it is preferred that they be generally contained in a total amount of 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p> <p>For example, when zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide (Cu.sub.2 O) are used in combination as the antifouling agent, zinc pyrithione may be contained in the antifouling coating composition in the above amount and cuprous oxide generally in an amount of about 30 to 1200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. Even if zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide are contained, the antifouling coating composition of the present invention is excellent in storage stability and free from viscosity increase/gelation during the storage as different from the above-mentioned antifouling paint of the prior art.</p><p>In the conventional antifouling paint, the incorporation of zinc pyrithione causes viscosity increase/gelation. For example, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 6(1994)-25560, a hydrolyzable self-polishing antifouling paint comprising a copolymer of tributyltin methacrylate, methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate and, mixed therewith, zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide has poor storage stability and suffers from gradual viscosity increase/gelation during the long-term storage. However, even if zinc pyrithione is contained or even if zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide as another antifouling agent are contained, the antifouling coating composition of the present invention is excellent in storage stability and free from viscosity increase/gelation during the storage as described above.</p><p>Incidentally, the trend toward viscosity increase/gelation of the conventional antifouling paint containing zinc pyrithione during the storage can be made difficult to occur by the addition thereto of a divalent copper compound such as copper naphthenate or copper octylate, a metallic resin composition containing a divalent copper compound as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 62(1987)-57464 or the like because the zinc pyrithione of the antifouling paint is converted by chelate exchange to copper pyrithione although the slime resistance of the antifouling paint is occasionally deteriorated.</p><heading>Other Component</heading><p>The antifouling coating composition of the present invention comprises the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin. In addition, it may contain zinc flower (zinc oxide), a dehydrating agent, a (meth)acrylic ester polymer of 1000 to 100,000 in number average molecular weight that is compatible with the above film forming copolymer, a flake pigment, an antisagging/antisettling agent, a pigment, a solvent, etc.</p><heading>Zinc Flower</heading><p>The addition of zinc flower to the antifouling coating composition enables increasing the strength of the obtained coating film and also effectively controlling the grittability of the coating film. This zinc flower is preferably added in an amount of 5 to 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer (polymer). Even if zinc flower and further the metal pyrithione of the above formula [II] or derivative thereof (e.g., zinc pyrithione when R.sup.1 -R.sup.4 =H, M=Zn, n=2) are contained, the trend toward viscosity increase/gelation of the antifouling coating composition of the present invention attributed to the hydrolysis in the presence of water during the storage can be suppressed to thereby ensure excellent storage stability of the antifouling coating composition.</p><heading>Dehydrating Agent</heading><p>The addition of a dehydrating agent to the antifouling coating composition enables improving the storage stability thereof. Both an organic dehydrating agent and an inorganic dehydrating agent can be used. Examples of dehydrating agents include anhydrous gypsum (CaSO.sub.4), synthetic zeolite adsorbents [trade name: Molecular Sieves 3A, 4A, 5A, 13X, etc., Molecular Sieves 3A, 4A and 5A are preferred, the numeral indicates the pore size (unit: angstrom)], orthoesters such as methyl orthoformate and methyl orthoacetate, orthoboric esters, silicates and isocyanates (trade name: Additive TI). Of these, inorganic dehydrating agents are preferred. In particular, anhydrous gypsum and Molecular Sieves, especially, Molecular Sieves are preferred.</p><p>At least one organic dehydrating agent and at least one inorganic dehydrating agent may be used in combination. Alternatively, either at least one organic dehydrating agent or at least one inorganic dehydrating agent, preferably, at least one inorganic dehydrating agent may be used. The reason for the preference for Molecular Sieves over anhydrous gypsum is as follows. When the antifouling coating composition containing anhydrous gypsum is applied to, for example, the surface of a ship bottom, water-soluble hydrated gypsum is likely to crystallize on the surface of the coating film in rainfall or sweat after application to thereby cause blushing of the coating film. Moreover, when a top coating is applied to the surface of the antifouling coating film, the top coating applicability is likely to suffer from (adverse) effects. For avoiding these, the use of Molecular Sieves is preferred.</p><p>The present invention will be described in greater detail in relation to the above dehydrating agent while comparing it with the coating composition of Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 7(1995)-18216. A substance of relatively low molecular weight is contained as the film forming copolymer in the antifouling coating composition of the present invention, so that the viscosity increase/gelation during the storage is inhibited to some extent even in the antifouling coating composition not containing the dehydrating agent. Further, even if the viscosity of the antifouling coating composition is slightly increased and the trend thereof toward gelation is recognized during the long-term storage, the formed coating film is consumable (self-polishing) and excellent antifouling properties is recognized as long as the antifouling coating composition can be diluted with an appropriately selected solvent and applied to ship bottoms, etc. The reason for the retention of consumability despite the coating film formed from the antifouling coating composition having suffered from viscosity increase and gelation would be that, for example, in the antifouling coating composition containing the (meth)acrylic ester polymer, the film forming copolymer of relatively low molecular weight and the (meth)acrylic ester polymer are used in combination mainly in the above-mentioned proportions.</p><p>By contrast, the coating composition described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 7(1995)-18216 exhibits a marked trend toward viscosity increase and gelation during the storage thereof when the dehydrating agent is not contained. The coating film formed by applying the coating composition having suffered from viscosity increase and gelation to, for example, ship bottoms has substantially no consumability recognized, thereby having poor antifouling properties.</p><p>In the present invention, it is preferred that, in particular, the inorganic dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 0.5 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>It is preferred that the inorganic dehydrating agent be contained in the antifouling coating composition in an amount of, generally, 0.01 to 10% by weight, especially, 0.1 to 5% by weight. When the amount of the inorganic dehydrating agent is in the range of 0.01 to 10% by weight, the effect of addition thereof is excellent and the antifouling properties can be improved.</p><p>When the inorganic dehydrating agent is used in combination with the organic dehydrating agent, the organic dehydrating agent may be added in an amount of, generally, about 5 to 300% by weight per 100 parts by weight of the inorganic dehydrating agent.</p><heading>Antisagging/Antisettling Agent</heading><p>Antisagging/antisettling agents other than those such as organic clay which deteriorate the storage stability of the antifouling coating composition can be added in arbitrary amounts. Examples of suitable antisagging/antisettling agents include salts such as Al, Ca and Zn stearates, lecithinates and alkylsulfonates, waxes such as polyethylene wax, amide wax, hydrogenated castor oil or polyamide wax and mixtures thereof, synthetic particulate silica and polyethylene oxide wax. Of these, hydrogenated castor oil wax, polyamide wax, synthetic particulate silica and polyethylene oxide wax are preferred. Further, use is made of antisagging/antisettling agents commercially available under the trade names, for example, "Disparon 305" and "Disparon 4200-20", products of Kusumoto Chemicals, Ltd.</p><heading>(Meth)acrylic Ester Polymer</heading><p>The antifouling coating composition of the present invention comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin may further comprise a (meth)acrylic ester polymer (homopolymer or copolymer of a (meth)acrylic ester other than silyl (meth)acrylate) of 1000 to 100,000 (100 thousand) in number average molecular weight that is compatible with the above film forming copolymer.</p><p>The addition of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer compatible with the film forming copolymer to the antifouling coating composition of the present invention comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin (together with the inorganic dehydrating agent, etc.) advantageously enables further improving the cracking resistance of the obtained coating film and regulating the rate of consumption of the coating film into the seawater and the retention of the antifouling capability within suitable ranges. Further, the above addition of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer advantageously enables exerting the effect of improving the adherence of the obtained coating film when the conventional antifouling coating film is coated with the antifouling coating composition of the present invention. Still further, the above addition of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer advantageously enables improving the cracking resistance of the obtained coating film even if the amount of added chlorinated paraffin is reduced.</p><p>Homopolymers and copolymers of (meth)acrylic esters other than the silyl (meth)acrylate employed in the preparation of the film forming copolymer can be mentioned as the (meth)acrylic ester polymer compatible with the film forming copolymer. Examples thereof include (meth)acrylic ester homopolymers, copolymers of at least two (meth)acrylic esters and (meth)acrylic ester/styrene copolymers. These (meth)acrylic ester polymers can be used either individually or in combination.</p><p>The above (meth)acrylic ester polymer may be, for example, either linear or branched and further may have a crosslink structure as long as it is compatible with the film forming copolymer.</p><p>The terminology "(meth)acrylic ester polymer compatible with the film forming copolymer" used herein means the (meth)acrylic ester polymer whose 30% by weight xylene solution forms a transparent homogeneous solution or a milk-white homogeneous solution without separating to two liquid layers when mixed with a xylene solution containing the film forming copolymer (also referred to as "trialkylsilyl (meth)acrylate copolymer") in a concentration of 30% by weight in a volume ratio of 1:1 at 25</p><p>When the number average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer falls within the above range, not only can inhibition of the cracking and regulation of the consumability be effectively carried out but also it is likely to enable forming an antifouling coating film which is also excellent in static antifouling properties.</p><p>When the number average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer is greater than the above range, it is likely for the static antifouling properties to be deteriorated although the effects of inhibiting the cracking of the obtained antifouling coating film and reducing the consumability thereof are conspicuous. On the other hand, when the number average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer is smaller than the above range, it is likely for the crack inhibiting effect to be deteriorated although the antifouling properties of the obtained antifouling coating film can be held high.</p><p>Examples of these (meth)acrylic ester polymers include homopolymers of a (meth)acrylic ester such as methyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate, t-butyl (meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate or phenyl (meth)acrylate and copolymers of these monomers; and</p><p>Copolymers of the above (meth)acrylic ester monomer and each of various monomers such as styrenes and other aromatic vinyl compounds (e.g., styrene (ST)), vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, ethylene, propylene, butadiene and vinyl ether compounds.</p><p>Specific examples of suitable (meth)acrylic ester polymers include:</p><p>Copolymer 1: obtained by copolymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) with butyl methacrylate (BMA) in a weight ratio [MMA/BMA] of 30 to 70/70 to 30 (total of all components: 100 parts by weight) and having a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 100 thousand, preferably, 1000 to 50 thousand;</p><p>Copolymer 2: obtained by copolymerizing isobutyl methacrylate (i-BMA), t-butyl methacrylate (t-BMA), styrene (ST) and stearyl methacrylate (SLMA) in a weight ratio [i-BMA/t-BMA/ST/SLMA] of 10 to 40/10 to 40/20 to 60/5 to 20 (total of all components: 100 parts by weight) and having a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 100 thousand, preferably, 1000 to 80 thousand or so;</p><p>Homopolymer 3: obtained by polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) and having a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 100 thousand, preferably, 1000 to 20 thousand or so;</p><p>Homopolymer 4: obtained by polymerizing ethyl methacrylate (EMA) and having a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 100 thousand, preferably, 1000 to 20 thousand or so;</p><p>Copolymer 5: obtained by copolymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) with butyl acrylate (BA) in a weight ratio [MMA/BA] of 99 to 50/1 to 50 (total of all components: 100 parts by weight) and having a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 100 thousand, preferably, 1000 to 50 thousand or so; and</p><p>Copolymer 6: obtained by copolymerizing ethyl methacrylate (EMA) with butyl acrylate (BA) in a weight ratio [EMA/BA] of 100 to 70/0 to 30 (total of all components: 100 parts by weight) and having a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 100 thousand, preferably, 1000 to 30 thousand or so.</p><p>Of the above (meth)acrylic ester polymers, it is preferred to employ hydrophobic acrylic polymers (having a (meth)acrylic ester content of greater than 50% by weight and a styrene content of less than 50% by weight) and styrene polymers (having a styrene content of at least 50% by weight). The use of copolymers 1 and 2 as the (meth)acrylic ester polymer is especially preferred.</p><p>It is preferred that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the above (meth)acrylic ester polymer exceed 0 that it range from 20 to 105 polymers of low glass transition temperature (Tg) (e.g., butyl acrylate (BA) homopolymer) occasionally deteriorates the effect of inhibiting cracking of the obtained antifouling coating film.</p><p>Although incorporated generally in an amount of 10 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer in antifouling coating compositions containing the film forming copolymer but not containing the chlorinated paraffin, the above (meth)acrylic ester polymer can be used in the present antifouling coating composition containing the chlorinated paraffin in reduced amounts ranging from 5 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>That is, in the antifouling coating composition comprising not only the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin but also the (meth)acrylic ester polymer, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 100 to 2000 parts by weight, especially, 150 to 1500 parts by weight,</p><p>the (meth)acrylic ester polymer be contained in an amount of 5 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 10 to 200 parts by weight and, still especially, 15 to 160 parts by weight, and</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of, generally, 5 to 150 parts by weight, especially, 8 to 100 parts by weight.</p><p>In particular, when the antifouling agent contains zinc pyrithione, it is preferred that, in the antifouling coating composition, zinc pyrithione be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.5 to 600 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 500 parts by weight and, still especially, 2 to 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer and that the antifouling agent as a whole containing zinc pyrithione be contained in an amount of, generally, 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer, together with the above amounts of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and chlorinated paraffin.</p><p>Further, in the antifouling coating composition comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer, the chlorinated paraffin, the inorganic dehydrating agent and the (meth)acrylic ester polymer, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight,</p><p>the inorganic dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 0.5 to 100 parts by weight and, still especially, 1 to 100 parts by weight, and</p><p>the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and the chlorinated paraffin be contained in the above amounts.</p><p>In both the above compositions, when the content of the chlorinated paraffin is in the range of 5 to 150 parts by weight, the cracking of the obtained antifouling coating film is satisfactorily inhibited and the mechanical strength of the obtained antifouling coating film become excellent.</p><p>It is desired that no carboxyl residue be present in the (meth)acrylic ester polymer of the antifouling coating composition as in the above film forming copolymer. When the carboxyl residue is present in the (meth)acrylic ester polymer, the storage stability of the obtained antifouling coating composition is likely to be gravely deteriorated. Therefore, it is preferred that the monomer having no carboxyl residue be employed so that the acid value (AV) of the polymer is as low as, generally, up to 15, preferably, up to 10 and, still preferably, up to 5.</p><p>The above antifouling coating composition containing the (meth)acrylic ester polymer enables inhibiting cracking of the antifouling coating film and regulating the consumption thereof, for example, even when the antifouling coating composition is applied to ship bottoms and the formed coating film (antifouling coating film) is submerged. The above antifouling coating composition can provide required consumption degree and antifouling performance in accordance with the environment in which the formed coating film is placed. Therefore, the antifouling coating composition containing the (meth)acrylic ester polymer enables minimizing the thickness of the coating film according to use, so that, also, economic advantage is great.</p><heading>Flake Pigment</heading><p>The antifouling coating composition of the present invention comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin may further contain the following flake pigment.</p><p>Examples of suitable flake pigments include mica powder, flake aluminum powder, copper powder, zinc powder and pearlescent pigment. Of these, mica powder is preferred.</p><p>Ores from which mica powder can be obtained, for example, include:</p><p>muscovite ores such as muscovite, lepidolite, paragonite, sericite, roscoelite and illite,</p><p>biotite ores such as biotite, phlogopite, lepidomelane and zinnwaldite, and</p><p>glauconite and celadonite. Generally, muscovite pulverization product is employed.</p><p>Although, generally, the average particle size and aspect ratio of the above flake pigment are not particularly limited, it is preferred that the average particle size range from 0.1 to 200 μm and the aspect ratio (ratio of long side to short side of particle) be at least 10.</p><p>In the antifouling coating composition comprising not only the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin but also the flake pigment, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 100 to 800 parts by weight, especially, 200 to 600 parts by weight,</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of, generally, 5 to 65 parts by weight, especially, 8 to 55 parts by weight, and</p><p>the flake pigment be contained in an amount of, generally, 1 to 150 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 150 parts by weight, still especially, 5 to 100 parts by weight and, yet still especially, 5 to 90 parts by weight.</p><p>In particular, when the antifouling agent contains zinc pyrithione, it is preferred that, in the antifouling coating composition, zinc pyrithione be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.5 to 600 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer and that the antifouling agent as a whole containing zinc pyrithione be contained in an amount of, generally, 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer, together with the above amounts of the chlorinated paraffin and flake pigment.</p><p>Further, in the antifouling coating composition comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer, the chlorinated paraffin and the inorganic dehydrating agent and further the flake pigment, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight,</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of, generally, 5 to 65 parts by weight, especially, 8 to 55 parts by weight,</p><p>the inorganic dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 100 parts by weight, and</p><p>the flake pigment be contained in an amount of, generally, 1 to 100 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 90 parts by weight.</p><p>In both the above antifouling coating compositions, when the amount of the flake pigment is in the range of 1 to 100 parts by weight, the effect of the addition thereof is satisfactory and the antifouling effect becomes excellent.</p><p>This antifouling coating composition containing the flake pigment not only exerts the above effects but also enables forming a coating film having especially high cracking resistance.</p><p>It is generally considered that the blending of the flake pigment in an antifouling coating composition would be effective in improving the cracking resistance of the obtained coating film. However, the conventional antifouling paint had the problem that the blending of a flake pigment having no physiological activity therein blocks the elution of the antifouling agent from the obtained antifouling coating film to thereby gravely deteriorate the antifouling activity thereof. By contrast, the coating film formed from the silylester-based antifouling coating composition (AF) of the present invention being excellent in self-polishing properties (consumability) is excellent in surface renewability in seawater, so that, even if the flake pigment is present on the surface of the coating film, satisfactory renewal of the coating film is attained. Moreover, the antifouling activity is originally on an extremely high level, so that it is feasible to more effectively inhibit cracking after submergence while restricting excess elution of the antifouling agent and retaining (regulating) it within an appropriate range.</p><p>More concrete description will be made with respect to an example of coating film which has been formed from the antifouling coating composition containing a copolymer of tributylsilyl (meth)acrylate [TBS(M)A] and methyl (meth)acrylate [M(M)A] as the film forming copolymer. In the seawater, the tributylsiloxy group (Bu.sub.3 SiO--) of the film forming copolymer is cleaved from the carbonyl group (--CO--) bonded to the principal chain of the copolymer under the influence of hydroxide ion (OH.sup.-), etc. and converted to tributylsilanol (Bu.sub.3 SiOH), thereby being dissolved into the seawater. Further, the polymer constituting the principal chain is also detached and dissolved into the seawater in a structure of carboxylic salt (--COO.sup.-). Therefore, the antifouling coating film interface with the seawater (surface of the antifouling coating film) would be continuously renewed. Accordingly, the antifouling agent contained in the antifouling coating film is rapidly liberated from the surface of the antifouling coating film. However, when the flake pigment is contained in the coating composition as mentioned above, the contact of the antifouling agent and film forming copolymer with the seawater is restricted, so that the above effect would be exerted in the present invention.</p><p>The antifouling coating composition of the invention comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the chlorinated paraffin may contain the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and the flake pigment.</p><p>In the antifouling coating composition comprising the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer, the chlorinated paraffin, the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and the flake pigment, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 100 to 2000 parts by weight, especially, 150 to 1500 parts by weight,</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of, generally, 3 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 100 parts by weight and, still especially, 10 to 100 parts by weight,</p><p>the (meth)acrylic ester polymer be contained in an amount of, generally, 1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 100 parts by weight and, still especially, 10 to 100 parts by weight, and</p><p>the flake pigment be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.5 to 400 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 200 parts by weight and, still especially, 5 to 150 parts by weight.</p><p>In particular, when the antifouling agent contains zinc pyrithione, it is preferred that, in the antifouling coating composition, zinc pyrithione be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.5 to 600 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 500 parts by weight and, still especially, 2 to 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer and that the antifouling agent as a whole containing zinc pyrithione be contained in an amount of, generally, 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer, together with the above amounts of the chlorinated paraffin, (meth)acrylic ester polymer and flake pigment.</p><p>Further, in the antifouling coating composition comprising not only the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer, the chlorinated paraffin and the inorganic dehydrating agent but also the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and the flake pigment, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight,</p><p>the inorganic dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 100 parts by weight and, still especially, 5 to 90 parts by weight, and</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin, the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and the flake pigment be contained in the same amounts as above.</p><heading>Pigment, Solvent, etc.</heading><p>Not only the below described flake pigment (e.g., mica powder) but also various conventional organic and inorganic pigments (e.g., titanium white and red iron oxide) can be used as the pigment.

Further, when the antifouling coating composition is applied to, for example, a ship bottom and formed coating film (antifouling coating film) is submerged, cracking of the antifouling coating film is inhibited. Still further, when the antifouling coating composition is applied to a primer surface, peeling of the antifouling coating film from the primer surface is inhibited. Still further, when coating of, for example, a ship bottom with each of various antifouling paints including the antifouling coating composition of the present invention is conducted a plurality of times or when the antifouling coating composition of the present invention is applied for repair to the surface of, for example, a ship bottom already covered with the antifouling coating film of the present invention, peeling of the antifouling coating film of the present invention from the surface of the previously formed antifouling coating film is inhibited. Moreover, consumption regulation can be executed with respect to the above antifouling coating film of the present invention provided on the primer surface, the surface of ship bottom to be repaired, etc., so that required consumption degree and antifouling power (properties) can be given in accordance with the environment in which the antifouling coating film is used. Accordingly, the present antifouling coating composition enables minimizing the thickness of the antifouling coating film to be formed in accordance with use, so that economic advantage is great.</p><p>The first antifouling coating composition of the present invention is as fully described above. The respective constitutions, contents and preferred forms of the antifouling agent, film forming copolymer, (meth)acrylic ester polymer, chlorinated paraffin, flake pigment and other components contained in the above antifouling coating composition apply as they are to the following second and third antifouling coating compositions of the present invention unless otherwise specified.</p><p>The second antifouling coating composition of the present invention will be described in detail below.</p><heading>Second Antifouling Coating Composition</heading><p>The second antifouling coating composition of the present invention (second antifouling coating composition) comprises the antifouling agent, the film forming copolymer and the (meth)acrylic ester polymer,</p><p>in which the (meth)acrylic ester polymer is contained in an amount of 10 to 500 parts by weight, preferably, 15 to 400 parts by weight and, still preferably, 20 to 300 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>This antifouling coating composition is of the one package type and has excellent storage stability. The antifouling coating film formed by applying the antifouling coating composition to the surface of a ship bottom or the like and curing it is resistant to cracking when submerged and has excellent antifouling and self-polishing properties (consumability). Further, when the coating film is provided on the surface of a primer, peeling of the antifouling coating film from the primer surface is inhibited.

When the amount of the flake pigment is in the range of 0.5 to 400 parts by weight, the effect of the addition thereof is satisfactory and the antifouling effect becomes excellent.</p><p>The second antifouling coating composition may contain the above dehydrating agent, preferably, the inorganic dehydrating agent (e.g., Molecular Sieve, anhydrous gypsum, etc.). In this antifouling coating composition, it is preferred that the inorganic dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of 0.5 to 400 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>The second antifouling coating composition may contain not only arbitrary components such as the antisagging/antisettling agent, the pigment and the solvent but also various components customarily added to antifouling paints, such as a plasticizer, an elution auxiliary, a dissolution retarder, an antiflooding agent and a defoamer.</p><p>Examples of these customary components include:</p><p>elution auxiliaries such as rosin, naphthenic acid, metal salts of rosin and metal salts of naphthenic acid;</p><p>plasticizers such as chlorinated paraffin (chloroparaffin), dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and tricresyl phosphate (TCP);</p><p>resins such as chlorinated rubber, vinyl chloride resin, vinyl ether resin and styrene/butadiene resin; and</p><p>particulate silica.</p><p>For example, chlorinated paraffin added according to necessity may be contained in the antifouling coating composition of the present invention in an amount of 1 to 200 parts by weight, preferably, 5 to 100 parts by weight and, still preferably, 10 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>When the amount of the chlorinated paraffin is in the range of 1 to 200 parts by weight, the crack inhibiting effect is fully exerted on the coating film formed from the antifouling coating composition and the strength of the coating film and the resistant to damages (impact) becomes excellent.</p><p>The above one-package second antifouling coating composition of the present invention enables forming an antifouling coating film which is excellent not only in cracking resistance, properties such as resistance to peeling from ship bottoms and other substrates or primer layers and antifouling properties but also in storage stability and consumability (self-polishing properties).</p><p>The third antifouling coating composition of the present invention will be described in detail below.</p><heading>Third Antifouling Coating Composition</heading><p>The third antifouling coating composition of the present invention (third antifouling coating composition) comprises the above film forming copolymer and zinc flower (zinc oxide),</p><p>in which the zinc flower is contained in an amount of 1 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably, 3 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of zinc flower is in the range of 1 to 1000 parts by weight, cracking and peeling readily do not occur on the coating film brought under dry conditions, for example, exposed to air. Moreover, not only can excellent improvement obtained in the effect on cracking and peeling resistances (including cracking and peeling resistances in submergence and under alternate dry and wet as in the vicinity of draft) but also cracking at the time of application or drying due to the excessively high pigment content and increase of the quantity of dust at the time of spray coating can be prevented.</p><p>This antifouling coating composition comprising the film forming copolymer and zinc flower (zinc oxide) may contain the chlorinated paraffin, the (meth)acrylic ester polymer, the dehydrating agent, the antifouling agent (excluding zinc flower) and the flake pigment as in the above first and second antifouling coating compositions.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition the chlorinated paraffin, it is preferred that zinc flower be contained in the above amount and that the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of, generally, 18 to 65 parts by weight, especially, 20 to 55 parts by weight and, still especially, 20 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of the chlorinated paraffin is in the range of 18 to 65 parts by weight, the crack inhibiting effect on the coating film formed from the antifouling coating composition and the strength of the coating film are excellent and the resistant to damages also becomes excellent.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition containing the (meth)acrylic ester polymer, it is preferred that zinc flower be contained in the above amount and that the (meth)acrylic ester polymer be contained in an amount of 5 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 10 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>The addition of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer to the third antifouling coating composition in the above amount advantageously enables further improving the cracking resistance of the obtained coating film and regulating the rate of consumption of the coating film into the seawater and the retention of the antifouling capability within suitable ranges. Further, the above addition of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer advantageously enables exerting the effect of further improving the adherence of the obtained coating film when the conventional antifouling coating film is coated with the antifouling coating composition of the present invention. Still further, the above addition of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer advantageously enables improving the cracking resistance of the obtained coating film even if the amount of added chlorinated paraffin is reduced. The content of the (meth)acrylic ester polymer can be decreased in the antifouling coating composition containing the chlorinated paraffin. In this composition, the (meth)acrylic ester polymer can be used in an amount of 5 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition containing the chlorinated paraffin and the (meth)acrylic ester polymer, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>zinc flower be contained in the above amount,</p><p>the (meth)acrylic ester polymer be contained in an amount of 5 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 10 to 200 parts by weight and, still especially, 15 to 160 parts by weight, and</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of 5 to 150 parts by weight, especially, 8 to 100 parts by weight. Further, in this antifouling coating composition, it is preferred that the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 100 to 2000 parts by weight, especially, 150 to 1500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of the chlorinated paraffin is in the range of 5 to 150% parts by weight, resistance to cracking on the obtained antifouling coating film and the mechanical strength of the obtained antifouling coating film both become excellent.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition containing the dehydrating agent, it is preferred that zinc flower be contained in the above amount and that the dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 0.1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition containing the chlorinated paraffin and the dehydrating agent, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>zinc flower be contained in the above amount,</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of 3 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 150 parts by weight and, still especially, 18 to 65 parts by weight, and</p><p>the dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 100 parts by weight.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition containing the chlorinated paraffin, the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and the dehydrating agent, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the zinc flower and the dehydrating agent be contained in the above amounts,</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of 3 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 150 parts by weight, and</p><p>the (meth)acrylic ester polymer be contained in an amount of 1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 200 parts by weight and, still especially, 10 to 200 parts by weight.</p><p>The addition of the flake pigment to the antifouling coating composition enables more effectively inhibiting the cracking after submergence while regulating an excess elution of the antifouling agent from the antifouling coating film so as to hold the elution within an appropriate range.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition comprising not only the film forming copolymer and zinc flower but also the chlorinated paraffin and the flake pigment, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>zinc flower be contained in the above amount,</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of, generally, 5 to 65 parts by weight, especially, 8 to 55 parts by weight, and</p><p>the flake pigment be contained in an amount of, generally, 1 to 100 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 90 parts by weight.</p><p>Further, in this antifouling coating composition, it is preferred that the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 100 to 800 parts by weight, especially, 200 to 600 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. When the amount of the flake pigment is in the range of 1 to 100 parts by weight, the effect of the addition thereof is satisfactory and the antifouling effect becomes excellent. The above antifouling coating composition containing the flake pigment not only exerts the above effects but also enables forming an antifouling coating film having especially high cracking resistance.</p><p>In the third antifouling coating composition of the present invention containing the chlorinated paraffin, the (meth)acrylic ester polymer and the flake pigment, it is preferred that, per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer,</p><p>the zinc flower be contained in the above amount,</p><p>the chlorinated paraffin be contained in an amount of, generally, 3 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 100 parts by weight and, still especially, 10 to 100 parts by weight,</p><p>the (meth)acrylic ester polymer be contained in an amount of, generally, 1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 5 to 100 parts by weight and, still especially, 10 to 100 parts by weight, and</p><p>the flake pigment be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.5 to 400 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 200 parts by weight and, still especially, 5 to 150 parts by weight. In this antifouling coating composition, it is preferred that the antifouling agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 100 to 2000 parts by weight, especially, 150 to 1500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>The addition of the dehydrating agent to the third antifouling coating composition of the present invention enables further improving the storage stability of the composition. It is preferred that the dehydrating agent be contained in an amount of, generally, 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, especially, 1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer.</p><p>With respect to all the above third antifouling coating compositions, further addition of the antifouling agent (excluding zinc flower) thereto is preferred. Unless otherwise specified, it is preferred that the antifouling agent (excluding zinc flower) be contained in an amount of, for example, 50 to 1500 parts by weight, especially, 80 to 1200 parts by weight or so per 100 parts by weight of the film forming copolymer. Copper, copper compounds (e.g., cuprous oxide), zinc pyrithione and the like are suitably used as the antifouling agent (biocide) as in the above first and second antifouling coating compositions.</p><p>This third antifouling coating composition enables forming a high-performance coating film which is excellent in cracking and peeling resistances, especially, in dryness, for example, exposure to air and which is free from rapid advance of cracking and peeling (stable irrespective of passage of time) even in atmosphere in which immersion in the water and exposure to dryness alternate with each other because of draft changes.</p><p>This third antifouling coating composition, when comprising not only the film forming copolymer and zinc flower but also the chlorinated paraffin, (meth)acrylic ester polymer, dehydrating agent, antifouling agent (excluding zinc flower), etc., enables forming an antifouling coating film which not only exerts the above effects but also is excellent in properties such as resistance to peeling from ship bottoms and other substrates or primer layers and further in antifouling and self-polishing (consumability) properties. Moreover, the storage stability of the composition is excellent.</p><heading>Process for Production</heading><p>All the first, second and third antifouling coating compositions of the present invention described in detail above can be produced by appropriate employment of conventional techniques. The production can be achieved by combining the above-mentioned components together in the above-mentioned proportions simultaneously or in arbitrary sequential order and subjecting the resultant matter to agitation/mixing/dispersion. For example, the above antifouling agent, zinc flower, film forming copolymer, chlorinated paraffin, (meth)acrylic ester polymer, flake pigment, dehydrating agent, antisagging/antisettling agent, pigment and solvent are combined simultaneously or in arbitrary sequential order and subjected to agitation/mixing/dispersion.</p><heading>EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The first and second antifouling coating compositions of the present invention enables forming an antifouling coating film which is excellent in properties such as cracking and peeling resistances, in antifouling properties and in self-polishing (consumability) properties.

Thus, for example, hulls and underwater structures coated with an antifouling coating film having excellent cracking resistance and antifouling properties can be obtained. These antifouling coating compositions may either be directly applied to the surface of hulls and underwater structures or applied to the surface of hulls and underwater structures precoated with an undercoating material such as a rust preventive or a primer. Moreover, these antifouling coating compositions may be applied as a top coat for repair to the surface of hulls and underwater structures previously coated with the conventional antifouling paint or the antifouling coating composition of the present invention. Although the thickness of the coating film thus formed on the surface of hulls and underwater structures is not particularly limited, for example, it ranges from about 30 to 150 μm per application.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What is claimed is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
