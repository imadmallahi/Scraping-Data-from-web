As modern electronic circuit boards evolve toward increased circuit and component densities, thorough board cleaning after soldering becomes a critical processing step. After soldering, the flux-resfdues are often removed with an organic solvent. De-fluxing solvents should be non-flammable, have low toxicity and have high solvency power, so that the flux and flux-residues can be removed without damaging the substrate being cleaned. Further, other types of residue, such as oils and greases, must be effectively removed from these devices for optimal performance in use.</p><p num="p0009">[0004] Alternative, non-ozone depleting solvents have become available since the elimination of nearly all previous CFCs and HCFCs as a result of the Montreal Protocol. While boiling point, flammability and solvent power 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
characteristics can often be adjusted by preparing solvent mixtures, these mixtures are often unsatisfactory because they fractionate to an undesirable degree during use. Such solvent mixtures also fractionate during solvent distillation, which makes it virtually impossible to recover a solvent mixture of the original composition.</p><p num="p0010">[0005] Azeotropic solvent mixtures may possess the properties needed for these de-fluxing, de-greasing applications and other cleaning agent needs. Azeotropic mixtures exhibit either a maximum or a minimum boiling point and do not fractionate on boiling. The inherent invariance of composition under boiling conditions insures that the ratios of the individual components of the mixture will not change during use and that solvency properties will remain constant as well.</p><p num="p0011">[0006] The present invention provides azeotropic and azeotrope-like compositions useful in semiconductor chip and circuit board cleaning, defluxing, and degreasing processes. The present compositions are nonflammable, and as they do not fractionate, will not produce flammable compositions during use. Additionally, the used azeotropic solvent mixtures may be re-distilled and re-used without composition change.</p><p num="p0012">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0013">[0007] The present invention relates to compositions comprising fluorinated ketones and at least two compounds selected from the group consisting of alcohols, halocarbons, fluoralkyl ethers, and hydrofluorocarbons.

<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
R<sup>1</sup>CH<sub>2</sub>CHIR<sup>2</sup>. This trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane can then be dehydroiodinated to form R<sup>1</sup>CH=CHR<sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, the olefin R<sup>1</sup>CH=CHR<sup>2</sup> may be prepared by dehydroiodination of a trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane of the formula R<sup>1</sup>CHICHaR<sup>2</sup> formed in turn by reacting a perfluoroalkyl iodide of the formula R<sup>2</sup>I with a perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin of the formula R<sup>1</sup>CH=CH2. [0012] Said contacting of a perfluoroalkyl iodide with a perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin may take place in batch mode by combining the reactants in a suitable reaction vessel capable of operating under the autogenous pressure of the reactants and products at reaction temperature. Suitable reaction vessels include those fabricated from stainless steels, in particular of the austenitic type, and the well-known high nickel alloys such as Monel® nickel-copper alloys, Hastelloy® nickel based alloys and Inconel® nickel-chromium alloys. Alternatively, the reaction may take be conducted in semi-batch mode in which the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin reactant is added to the perfluoroalkyl iodide reactant by means of a suitable addition apparatus such as a pump at the reaction temperature.</p><p num="p0024">[0013] The ratio of perfluoroalkyl iodide to perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin should be between about 1 :1 to about 4:1 , preferably from about 1.5:1 to 2.5:1. Ratios less than 1.5:1 tend to result in large amounts of the 2:1 adduct as reported by Jeanneaux, et. al . in Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, Vol. 4, pages 261-270 (1974).</p><p num="p0025">[0014] Temperatures for contacting of said perfluoroalkyl iodide with said perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin are preferably within the range of about 150<sup>0</sup>C to 300<sup>0</sup>C, more preferably from about 170<sup>0</sup>C to about 250<sup>0</sup>C, and most preferably from about 180<sup>0</sup>C to about 23O<sup>0</sup>C. Pressures for contacting of said perfluoroalkyl iodide with said perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin are preferably the autogenous pressure of the reactants at the reaction temperature. [0015] Suitable contact times for the reaction of the perfluoroalkyl iodide with the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin are from about 0.5 hour to 18 hours, preferably from about 4 to about 12 hours. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
[0016] The trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane prepared by reaction of the perfluoroalkyl iodide with the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin may be used directly in the dehydroiodination step or may preferably be recovered and purified by distillation prior to the dehydroiodination step. [0017] In yet another embodiment, the contacting of a perfluoroalkyliodide with a perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin takes place in the presence of a catalyst. In one embodiment, a suitable catalyst is a Group VIII transition metal complex. Representative Group VIII transition metal complexes include, without limitation, zero valent NiL<sub>4</sub> complexes, wherein the ligand, L, can be a phosphine ligand, a phosphite ligand, a carbonyl ligand, an isonitrile ligand, an alkene ligand, or a combination thereof. In one such embodiment, the Ni(O)L<sub>4</sub> complex is a NiL^(CO)<sub>2</sub> complex. In one particular embodiment, the Group VIII transition metal complex is bis(triphenyl phospine)nickel(O) dicarbonyl. In one embodiment, the ratio of perfluoroalkyl iodide to perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin is between about 3:1 to about 8:1. In one embodiment, the temperature for contacting of said perfluoroalkyl iodide with said perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin in the presence of a catalyst, is within the range of about 80<sup>0</sup>C to about 130<sup>0</sup>C. In another embodiment, the temperature is from about 90<sup>0</sup>C to about 120<sup>0</sup>C. [0018] In one embodiment, the contact time for the reaction of the perfluoroalkyl iodide with the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin in the presence of a catalyst is from about 0.5 hour to about 18 hours. In another embodiment, the contact time is from about 4 to about 12 hours. [0019] The dehydroiodination step is carried out by contacting the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane with a basic substance. Suitable basic substances include alkali metal hydroxides (e.g., sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), alkali metal oxide (for example, sodium oxide), alkaline earth metal hydroxides (e.g., calcium hydroxide), alkaline earth metal oxides (e.g., calcium oxide), alkali metal alkoxides (e.g., sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide), aqueous ammonia, sodium amide, or mixtures of basic 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
substances such as soda lime. Preferred basic substances are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.</p><p num="p0026">[0020] Said contacting of the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane with a basic substance may take place in the liquid phase preferably in the presence of a solvent capable of dissolving at least a portion of both reactants. Solvents suitable for the dehydroiodination step include one or more polar organic solvents such as alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, and tertiary butanol), nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, benzonitrile, or adiponitrile), dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, or sulfolane. The choice of solvent depends on the solubility of the basic substance, the solubility of the perfluoroalkyl iodide, and the solubility of the perfluoroalkyltrihydroolefin as well as the boiling point of the product, and the ease of separation of traces of the solvent from the product during purification. Typically, ethanol or isopropanol are good solvents for the reaction. Separation of solvent from the product may be effected by distillation, extraction, phase separation, or a combination of the three.</p><p num="p0027">[0021] Typically, the dehydroiodination reaction may be carried out by addition of one of the reactants (either the basic substance or the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane) to the other reactant in a suitable reaction vessel. Said reaction vessel may be fabricated from glass, ceramic, or metal and is preferably agitated with an impellor or other stirring mechanism. [0022] Temperatures suitable for the dehydroiodination reaction are from about 10<sup>0</sup>C to about 100<sup>0</sup>C, preferably from about 20<sup>0</sup>C to about 70<sup>0</sup>C. The dehydroiodination reaction may be carried out at ambient pressure or at reduced or elevated pressure. Of note are dehydroiodination reactions in which the compound of Formula I is distilled out of the reaction vessel as it is formed.</p><p num="p0028">[0023] Alternatively, the dehydroiodination reaction may be conducted by contacting an aqueous solution of said basic substance with a solution of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane in one or more organic solvents of lower polarity such as an alkane (e.g., hexane, heptane, or octane), aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g., toluene), halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g., methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, or perchloroethylene), or ether (e.g., diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, diglyme, or tetraglyme) in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. Suitable phase transfer catalysts include quaternary ammonium halides (e.g., tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium hydrosulfate, triethylbenzyiammonium chloride, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, and tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride), quaternary phosphonium halides (e.g., triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride), cyclic ether compounds known in the art as crown ethers (e.g., 18-crown-6 and 15-crown-5).</p><p num="p0029">[0024] Alternatively, the dehydroiodination reaction may be conducted in the absence of solvent by adding the trihydroiodoperfluoroalkane to one or more solid or liquid basic substance(s).</p><p num="p0030">[0025] Suitable reaction times for the dehydroiodination reactions are from about 15 minutes to about six hours or more depending on the solubility of the reactants. Typically the dehydroiodination reaction is rapid and requires about 30 minutes to about three hours for completion. [OO26] The compound of formula I may be recovered from the dehydroiodination reaction mixture by phase separation, optionally after . addition of water, by distillation, or by a combination thereof. [0027] In another embodiment, the invention relates to compositions comprising perfluoroethyl isopropyl ketone (I.I.I^.Z^.δ.δ.δ-nonafluoro^- (trifluoromethyl)-3-pentanone, (PEIK) and at least two compounds selected from the group consisting of alcohols, halocarbons, fluoralkyl ethers, and hydrofluorocarbons.

[0034] As used herein, an azeotropic composition is a constant boiling liquid admixture of two or more substances wherein the admixture distills without substantial composition change and behaves as a constant boiling composition. Constant boiling compositions, which are characterized as azeotropic, exhibit either a maximum or a minimum boiling point, as compared with that of the non-azeotropic mixtures of the same substances. Azeotropic compositions as used herein include homogeneous azeotropes which are liquid admixtures of two or more substances that behave as a single substance, in that the vapor, produced by partial evaporation or distillation of the liquid, has the same composition as the liquid. Azeotropic compositions as used herein also include heterogeneous azeotropes where the liquid phase splits into two or more liquid phases. In these embodiments, at the azeotropic point, the vapor phase is in equilibrium with two liquid phases and all three phases have different compositions. If the two equilibrium liquid phases of a heterogeneous azeotrope are combined and the composition of the overall liquid phase calculated, this would be identical to the composition of the vapor phase. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
[0035] As used herein, the term "azeotrope-like composition" also sometimes referred to as "near azeotropic composition," means a constant boiling, or substantially constant boiling liquid admixture of two or more substances that behaves as a single substance. One way to characterize an azeotrope-like composition is that the vapor produced by partial evaporation or distillation of the liquid has substantially the same composition as the liquid from which it was evaporated or distilled. That is, the admixture distills/refluxes without substantial composition change. Another way to characterize an azeotrope-like composition is that the bubble point vapor pressure of the composition and the dew point vapor pressure of the composition at a particular temperature are substantially the same. Herein, a composition is azeotrope-like if, after 50 weight percent of the composition is removed such as by evaporation or boiling off, the difference in vapor pressure between the original composition and the composition remaining after 50 weight percent of the original composition has been removed by evaporation or. boil off is less than 10 percent.</p><p num="p0037">[0036] In cleaning apparati, such as vapor degreasers or defluxers, some loss of the cleaning compositions may occur during operation through leaks in shaft seals, hose connections, soldered joints and broken lines. In addition, the working composition may be released to the atmosphere during maintenance procedures on equipment. If the composition is not a pure compound or azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition, the composition may change when leaked or discharged to the atmosphere from the equipment, which may cause the composition remaining in the equipment to become flammable or to exhibit unacceptable performance. Accordingly, it is desirable to use as a cleaning composition a single fluorinated hydrocarbon or an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition that fractionates to a negligible degree upon leak or boil-off.</p><p num="p0038">[0037] The azeotropic compositions of one embodiment of the present invention are listed in Table 3.

In particular, the present inventive azeotropic compositions are useful when de-fluxing circuit boards with components such as Flip chip, μBGA (ball grid array), and Chip scale or other advanced high-density packaging components. Flip chips, μBGA, and Chip scale are terms that describe high density packaging components used in the semi-conductor industry and are well understood by those working in the field. [OO43] In another embodiment the present invention relates to a process for removing residue from a surface or substrate, comprising: contacting the surface or substrate with a composition of the present invention and recovering the surface or substrate from the composition. [0O44] In a process embodiment of the invention, the surface or substrate may be an integrated circuit device, in which case, the residue comprises rosin flux or oil. The integrated circuit device may be a circuit board with various types of components, such as Flip chips, μBGAs, or Chip scale packaging components. The surface or substrate may additionally be a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="20"/>-->
metal surface such as stainless steel. The rosin flux may be any type commonly used in the soldering of integrated circuit devices, including but not limited to RMA (rosin mildly activated), RA (rosin activated), WS (water soluble), and OA (organic acid). Oil residues include but are not limited to mineral oils, motor oils, and silicone oils.</p><p num="p0227">[0045] In the inventive process, the means for contacting the surface or substrate is not critical and may be accomplished by immersion of the device in a bath containing the composition, spraying the device with the composition or wiping the device with a substrate that has been wet with the composition. Alternatively, the composition may also be used in a vapor degreasing or defluxing apparatus designed for such residue removal. Such vapor degreasing or defluxing equipment is available from various suppliers such as Forward Technology (a subsidiary of the Crest Group, Trenton, NJ), Trek Industries (Azusa, CA), and Ultronix, Inc. (Hatfield, PA) among others. [0046] An effective composition for removing residue from a surface would be one that had a Kauri-Butanol value (Kb) of at least about 10 , preferably about 40, and even more preferably about 100. The Kauri-Butanol value (Kb) for a given composition reflects the ability of said composition to solubilize various organic residues (e.g., machine and conventional refrigeration lubricants). The Kb value may be determined by ASTM D-1133- 94.</p><p num="p0228">[0047] The following specific examples are meant to merely illustrate the invention, and are not meant to be limiting in any way whatsoever.
