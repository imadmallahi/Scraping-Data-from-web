Neural stem cells are classically defined as having the ability to self-renew (i.e., form more stem cells), to proliferate, and to differentiate into multiple different phenotypic lineages, including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.</p><p>These neural stem cells have been isolated from several mammalian species, including mice, rats, pigs and humans. See, e.g., WO 93/01275, WO 94/09119, WO 94/10292, WO 94/16718 and Cattaneo et al., Mol. Brain Res., 42, pp. 161-66 (1996), all herein incorporated by reference.</p><p>Human CNS neural stem cells, like their rodent homologues, when maintained in a mitogen-containing (typically epidermal growth factor or epidermal growth factor plus basic fibroblast growth factor), serum-free culture medium, grow in suspension culture to form aggregates of cells known as "neurospheres". In the prior art, human neural stem cells have doubling rates of about 30 days. See, e.g., Cattaneo et al., Mol. Brain Res., 42, pp. 161-66 (1996). Upon removal of the mitogen(s) and provision of a substrate, the stem cells differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In the prior art, the majority of cells in the differentiated cell population have been identified as astrocytes, with very few neurons (&amp;lt;10%) being observed.</p><p>There remains a need to increase the rate of proliferation of neural stem cell cultures. There also remains a need to increase the number of neurons in the differentiated cell population. There further remains a need to improve the viability of neural stem cell grafts upon implantation into a host.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>This invention provides novel human central nervous system stem cells, and methods and media for proliferating, differentiating and transplanting them. In one embodiment, this invention provides novel human stem cells with a doubling rate of between 5-10 days, as well as defined growth media for prolonged proliferation of human neural stem cells. The invention also provides differentiated cell populations of human neural stem cells that provide previously unobtainable large numbers of neurons, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. This invention also provides novel methods for transplanting neural stem cells that improve the viability of the graft upon implantation in a host.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 shows a representation of spheres of proliferating 9 FBr human neural stem cells (passage 6) derived from human forebrain tissue.</p><p>FIG. 2, Panel A, shows a growth curve for a human neural stem cell line designated 6.5 Fbr cultured in (a) defined media containing EGF, FGF and leukemia inhibitory factor ("LIF") (shown as closed diamonds), and (b) the same media but without LIF (shown as open diamonds); Panel B shows a growth curve for a human neural stem cell line designated 9 Fbr cultured in (a) defined media containing EGF, FGF and LIF (shown as closed diamonds), and (b) the same media but without LIF (shown as open diamonds); Panel C shows a growth curve for a human neural stem cell line designated 9.5 Fbr cultured in (a) defined media containing EGF, FGF and LIF (shown as closed diamonds), and (b) the same media but without LIF (shown as open diamonds); Panel D shows a growth curve for a human neural stem cell line designated 10.5 Fbr cultured in (a) defined media containing EGF, FGF and leukemia inhibitory factor ("LIF") (shown as closed diamonds), and (b) the same media but without LIF (shown as open diamonds).</p><p>FIG. 3 shows a growth curve for a human neural stem cell line designated 9 Fbr cultured in (a) defined media containing EGF and basic fibroblast growth factor ("bFGF") (shown as open diamonds), and (b) defined media with EGF but without bFGF (shown as closed diamonds).</p><p>FIG. 4 shows a graph of cell number versus days in culture for an Mx-1 conditionally immortalized human glioblast line derived from a human neural stem cell line.

We have isolated 4 neural stem cell lines from human forebrain, all of which exhibit neural stem cell properties; namely, the cells are self renewing, the cells proliferate for long periods in mitogen containing serum free medium, and the cells, when differentiated, comprise a cell population of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These cells are capable of doubling every 5-10 days, in contrast with the prior art diencephalon-derived human neural stem cells. Reported proliferation rates of diencephalon-derived human neural stem cells approximate one doubling every 30 days. See Cattaneo et al., Mol. Brain Res., 42, pp. 161-66 (1996).</p><p>Any suitable tissue source may be used to derive the neural stem cells of this invention. Both allografts and autografts are contemplated for transplantation purposes.</p><p>This invention also provides a novel growth media for proliferation of neural stem cells. Provided herein is a serum-free or serum-depleted culture medium for the short term and long term proliferation of neural stem cells.</p><p>A number of serum-free or serum-depleted culture media have been developed due to the undesirable effects of serum which can lead to inconsistent culturing results. See, e.g., WO 95/00632 (incorporated herein by reference), and prior art medium described therein.</p><p>Prior to development of the novel media described herein, neural stem cells have been cultured in serum-free media containing epidermal growth factor ("EGF") or an analog of EGF, such as amphiregulin or transforming growth factor alpha ("TGF-a"), as the mitogen for proliferation. See, e.g., WO 93/01275, WO 94/16718, both incorporated herein by reference. Further, basic fibroblast growth factor ("bFGF") has been used, either alone, or in combination with EGF, to enhance long term neural stem cell survival.</p><p>The improved medium according to this invention, which contains leukemia inhibitory factor ("LIF"), markedly and unexpectedly increases the rate of proliferation of neural stem cells, particularly human neural stem cells.</p><p>We have compared growth rates of the forebrain-derived stem cells described herein in the presence and absence of LIF; unexpectedly we have found that LIF dramatically increases the rate of cellular proliferation in almost all cases.</p><p>The medium according to this invention comprises cell viability and cell proliferation effective amounts of the following components:</p><p>(a) a standard culture medium being serum-free (containing 0-0.49% serum) or serum-depleted (containing 0.5-5.0% serum), known as a "defined" culture medium, such as Iscove's modified DulbeccO's medium ("IMDM"), RPMI, DMEM, Fischer's, alpha medium, Leibovitz's, L-15, NCTC, F-10, F-12, MEM and McCoy's;</p><p>(b) a suitable carbohydrate source, such as glucose;</p><p>(c) a buffer such as MOPS, HEPES or Tris, preferably HEPES;</p><p>(d) a source of hormones including insulin, transferrin, progesterone, selenium, and putrescine;</p><p>(e) one or more growth factors that stimulate proliferation of neural stem cells, such as EGF, bFGF, PDGF, NGF, and analogs, derivatives and/or combinations thereof, preferably EGF and bFGF in combination;</p><p>(f) LIF</p><p>Standard culture media typically contains a variety of essential components required for cell viability, including inorganic salts, carbohydrates, hormones, essential amino acids, vitamins, and the like. We prefer DMEM or F-12 as the standard culture medium, most preferably a 50/50 mixture of DMEM and F-12. Both media are commercially available (DMEM--Gibco 12100-046; F-12 - Gibco 21700-075). A premixed formulation is also commercially available (N2 - Gibco 17502-030). It is advantageous to provide additional glutamine, preferably at about 2 mM. It is also advantageous to provide heparin in the culture medium. Preferably, the conditions for culturing should be as close to physiological as possible. The pH of the culture medium is typically between 6-8, preferably about 7, most preferably about 7.4. Cells are typically cultured between 30-40 between 35-37 are preferably grown in suspension culture.</p><p>In one exemplary embodiment, the neural stem cell culture comprises the following components in the indicated concentrations:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________Component        Final Concentration______________________________________50/50 mix of DMEM/F-12            0.5-2.0 X, preferably 1X  glucose 0.2-1.0%, preferably 0.6% w/v  glutamine 0.1-10 mM, preferably 2 mM  NaHCO.sub.3 0.1-10 mM, preferably 3 mM  HEPES 0.1-10 mM, preferably 5 mM  apo-human transferrin (Sigma T- 1-1000 μg/ml, preferably 100            μg/ml  2252)  human insulin (Sigma I-2767) 1-100, preferably 25 μg/ml  putrescine (Sigma P-7505) 1-500, preferably 60 μM  selenium (Sigma S-9133) 1-100, preferably 30 nM  progesterone (Sigma P-6149) 1-100, preferably 20 nM  human EGF (Gibco 13247-010) 0.2-200, preferably 20 ng/ml  human bFGF (Gibco 13256-029) 0.2-200, preferably 20 ng/ml  human LIF (R&amp;D Systems 250-L) 0.1-500, preferably 10 ng/ml  heparin (Sigma H-3149) 0.1-50, preferably 2 μg/ml  CO.sub.2 preferably 5%______________________________________</pre></p><p>Serum albumin may also be present in the instant culture medium--although the present medium is generally serum-depleted or serum-free (preferably serum-free), certain serum components which are chemically well defined and highly purified (&amp;gt;95%), such as serum albumin, may be included.</p><p>The human neural stem cells described herein may be cryopreserved according to routine procedures. We prefer cryopreserving about one to ten million cells in "freeze" medium which consists of proliferation medium (absent the growth factor mitogens), 10% BSA (Sigma A3059) and 7.5% DMSO. Cells are centrifuged. Growth medium is aspirated and replaced with freeze medium. Cells are resuspended gently as spheres, not as dissociated cells. Cells are slowly frozen, by, e.g., placing in a container at -80 C. Cells are thawed by swirling in a 37 fresh proliferation medium, and grown as usual.</p><p>In another embodiment, this invention provides a differentiated cell culture containing previously unobtainable large numbers of neurons, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In the prior art, typically the differentiated human diencephalon-derived neural stem cell cultures formed very few neurons (i.e., less than 5-10%). According to this methodology, we have routinely achieved neuron concentrations of between 20% and 35% (and much higher in other cases) in differentiated human forebrain-derived neural stem cell cultures. This is highly advantageous as it permits enrichment of the neuronal population prior to implantation in the host in disease indications where neuronal function has been impaired or lost.</p><p>Further, according to the methods of this invention, we have achieved differentiated neural stem cell cultures that are highly enriched in GABA-ergic neurons. Such GABA-ergic neuron enriched cell cultures are particularly advantageous in the potential therapy of excitotoxic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease or epilepsy.</p><p>In order to identify the cellular phenotype either during proliferation or differentiation of the neural stem cells, various cell surface or intracellular markers may be used.</p><p>When the neural stem cells of this invention are proliferating as neurospheres, we contemplate using human nestin antibody as a marker to identify undifferentiated cells. The proliferating cells should show little GFAP staining and little b-tubulin staining (although some staining might be present due to diversity of cells within the spheres).</p><p>When differentiated, most of the cells lose their nestin positive immunoreactivity. In particular, antibodies specific for various neuronal or glial proteins may be employed to identify the phenotypic properties of the differentiated cells. Neurons may be identified using antibodies to neuron specific enolase ("NSE"), neurofilament, tau, b-tubulin, or other known neuronal markers. Astrocytes may be identified using antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein ("GFAP"), or other known astrocytic markers. Oligodendrocytes may be identified using antibodies to galactocerebroside, O4, myelin basic protein ("MBP") or other known oligodendrocytic markers.</p><p>It is also possible to identify cell phenotypes by identifying compounds characteristically produced by those phenotypes. For example, it is possible to identify neurons by the production of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and the like.</p><p>Specific neuronal phenotypes can be identified according to the specific products produced by those neurons. For example, GABA-ergic neurons may be identified by their production of glutamic acid decarboxylase ("GAD") or GABA. Dopaminergic neurons may be identified by their production of dopa decarboxylase ("DDC"), dopamine or tyrosine hydroxylase ("TH"). Cholinergic neurons may be identified by their production of choline acetyltransferase ("ChAT"). Hippocampal neurons may be identified by staining with NeuN. It will be appreciated that any suitable known marker for identifying specific neuronal phenotypes may be used.</p><p>The human neural stem cells described herein can be genetically engineered or modified according to known methodology.</p><p>A gene of interest (i.e., a gene that encodes a biologically active molecule) can be inserted into a cloning site of a suitable expression vector by using standard techniques. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., WO 94/16718, incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>The expression vector containing the gene of interest may then be used to transfect the desired cell line. Standard transfection techniques such as calcium phosphate co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection, electroporation, biolistics, or viral transfection may be utilized. Commercially available mammalian transfection kits may be purchased from e.g., Stratagene. Human adenoviral transfection may be accomplished as described in Berg et al. Exp. Cell Res., 192, pp. (1991). Similarly, lipofectamine-based transfection may be accomplished as described in Cattaneo, Mol. Brain Res., 42, pp. 161-66 (1996).</p><p>A wide variety of host/expression vector combinations may be used to express a gene encoding a biologically active molecule of interest. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,723, herein incorporated by reference, for suitable cell-based production expression vectors.</p><p>Increased expression of the biologically active molecule can be achieved by increasing or amplifying the transgene copy number using amplification methods well known in the art. Such amplification methods include, e.g., DHFR amplification (see, e.g., Kaufman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,470,461) or glutamine synthetase ("GS") amplification (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464, and European published application EP 338,841), all herein incorporated by reference.</p><p>The neural stem cells described herein, and their differentiated progeny may be immortalized or conditionally immortalized using known techniques. We prefer conditional immortalization of stem cells, and most preferably conditional immortalization of their differentiated progeny. Among the conditional immortalization techniques contemplated are Tet-conditional immortalization (see WO 96/31242, incorporated herein by reference), and Mx-1 conditional immortalization (see WO 96/02646, incorporated herein by reference).</p><p>This invention also provides methods for differentiating neural stem cells to yield cell cultures enriched with neurons to a degree previously unobtainable. According to one protocol, the proliferating neurospheres are induced to differentiate by removal of the growth factor mitogens and LIF, and provision of 1% serum, a substrate and a source of ionic charges (e.g., glass cover slip covered with poly-ornithine or extracellular matrix components). The preferred base medium for this differentiation protocol, excepting the growth factor mitogens and LIF, is otherwise the same as the proliferation medium. This differentiation protocol produces a cell culture enriched in neurons. According to this protocol, we have routinely achieved neuron concentrations of between 20% and 35% in differentiated human forebrain-derived neural stem cell cultures.</p><p>According to a second protocol, the proliferating neurospheres are induced to differentiate by removal of the growth factor mitogens, and provision of 1% serum, a substrate and a source of ionic charges (e.g., glass cover slip covered with poly-ornithine or extracellular matrix components), as well as a mixture of growth factors including PDGF, CNTF, IGF-1, LIF, forskolin, T-3 and NT-3. The cocktail of growth factors may be added at the same time as the neurospheres are removed from the proliferation medium, or may be added to the proliferation medium and the cells pre-incubated with the mixture prior to removal from the mitogens. This protocol produces a cell culture highly enriched in neurons and enriched in oligodendrocytes. According to this protocol, we have routinely achieved neuron concentrations of higher than 35% in differentiated human forebrain-derived neural stem cell cultures.</p><p>The human stem cells of this invention have numerous uses, including for drug screening, diagnostics, genomics and transplantation.</p><p>The cells of this invention may be transplanted "naked" into patients according to conventional techniques, into the CNS, as described for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,082,670 and 5,618,531, each incorporated herein by reference, or into any other suitable site in the body.</p><p>In one embodiment, the human stem cells are transplanted directly into the CNS. Parenchymal and intrathecal sites are contemplated. It will be appreciated that the exact location in the CNS will vary according to the disease state. According to one aspect of this invention, provided herein is methodology for improving the viability of transplanted human neural stem cells. In particular, we have discovered that graft viability improves if the transplanted neural stem cells are allowed to aggregate, or to form neurospheres prior to implantation, as compared to transplantation of dissociated single cell suspensions. We prefer transplanting small sized neurospheres, approximately 10-500 μm in diameter, preferably 40-50 μm in diameter. Alternatively, we prefer spheres containing about 5-100, preferably 5-20 cells per sphere. We contemplate transplanting at a density of about 10,000-1,000,000 cells per μl, preferably 25,000-500,000 cells per μl.</p><p>The cells may also be encapsulated and used to deliver biologically active molecules, according to known encapsulation technologies, including microencapsulation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,352,883; 4,353,888; and 5,084,350, herein incorporated by reference), (b) macroencapsulation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,284,761, 5,158,881, 4,976,859 and 4,968,733 and published PCT patent applications W092/19195, WO 95/05452, each incorporated herein by reference).</p><p>If the human neural stem cells are encapsulated, we prefer macroencapsulation, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,284,761; 5,158,881; 4,976,859; 4,968,733; 5,800,828 and published PCT patent application WO 95/05452, each incorporated herein by reference. Cell number in the devices can be varied; preferably each device contains between 10.sup.3 -10.sup.9 cells, most preferably 10.sup.5 to 10.sup.7 cells. A large number of macroencapsulation devices may be implanted in the patient; we prefer between one to 10 devices.</p><p>In addition, we also contemplate "naked" transplantation of human stem cells in combination with a capsular device wherein the capsular device secretes a biologically active molecule that is therapeutically effective in the patient or that produces a biologically active molecule that has a growth or trophic effect on the transplanted neural stem cells, or that induces differentiation of the neural stem cells towards a particular phenotypic lineage.</p><p>The cells and methods of this invention may be useful in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases and other disorders. It is contemplated that the cells will replace diseased, damaged or lost tissue in the host. Alternatively, the transplanted tissue may augment the function of the endogenous affected host tissue. The transplanted neural stem cells may also be genetically modified to provide a biologically active molecule that is therapeutically effective.</p><p>Excitotoxicity has been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions including epilepsy, stroke, ischemia, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, neural stem cells may provide one means of preventing or replacing the cell loss and associated behavioral abnormalities of these disorders.</p><p>Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by a relentlessly progressive movement disorder with devastating psychiatric and cognitive deterioration. HD is associated with a consistent and severe atrophy of the neostriatum which is related to a marked loss of the GABAergic medium-sized spiny projection neurons, the major output neurons of the striatum. Intrastriatal injections of excitotoxins such as quinolinic acid (QA) mimic the pattern of selective neuronal vulnerability seen in HD. QA lesions result in motor and cognitive deficits which are among the major symptoms seen in HD. Thus, intrastriatal injections of QA have become a useful model of HD and can serve to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing, attenuating, or reversing neuroanatomical and behavioral changes associated with HD. Because GABA-ergic neurons are characteristically lost in Huntington's disease, we contemplate treatment of Huntington's patients by transplantation of cell cultures enriched in GABA-ergic neurons derived according to the methods of this invention.</p><p>Epilepsy is also associated with excitotoxicity. Accordingly, GABA-ergic neurons derived according to this invention are contemplated for transplantation into patients suffering from epilepsy.</p><p>We also contemplate use of the cells of this invention in the treatment of various demyelinating and dysmyelinating disorders, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, multiple sclerosis, various leukodystrophies, post-traumatic demyelination, and cerebrovascular (CVS) accidents, as well as various neuritis and neuropathies, particularly of the eye. We contemplate using cell cultures enriched in oligodendrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursor or progenitors, such cultures prepared and transplanted according to this invention to promote remyelination of demyelinated areas in the host.</p><p>We also contemplate use of the cells of this invention in the treatment of various acute and chronic pains, as well as for certain nerve regeneration applications (such as spinal cord injury). We also contemplate use of human stem cells for use in sparing or sprouting of photoreceptors in the eye.</p><p>The cells and methods of this invention are intended for use in a mammalian host, recipient, patient, subject or individual, preferably a primate, most preferably a human.</p><p>The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to be limiting.</p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><heading>Example 1</heading><heading>Media for Proliferating Neural Stem Cells</heading><p>Proliferation medium was prepared with the following components in the indicated concentrations:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________Component            Final Concentration______________________________________50/50 mix of DMEM/F-12                1Xglucose              0.6%      w/v  glutamine 2 mM  NaHCO.sub.3 3 mM  HEPES 5 mM  apo-human transferrin (Sigma T-2252) 100 μg/ml  human insulin (Sigma I-2767) 25 μg/ml  putrescine (Sigma P-7505) 60 μM  selenium (Sigma S-9133) 30 nM  progesterone (Sigma P-6149) 20 nM  human EGF (Gibco 13247-010) 20 ng/ml  human bFGF (Gibco 13256-029) 20 ng/ml  human LIF (R&amp;D Systems 250-L) 10 ng/ml  heparin (Sigma H-3149) 2 μg/ml______________________________________</pre></p><heading>Example 2</heading><heading>Isolation of Human CNS Neural Stem Cells</heading><p>Sample tissue from human embryonic forebrain was collected and dissected in Sweden and kindly provided by Huddinje Sjukhus. Blood samples from the donors were sent for viral testing. Dissections were performed in saline and the selected tissue was placed directly into proliferation medium (as described in Example 1). Tissue was stored at 4 dissociated. The tissue was dissociated using a standard glass homogenizer, without the presence of any digesting enzymes. The dissociated cells were counted and seeded into flasks containing proliferation medium. After 5-7 days, the contents of the flasks are centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet resuspended in 200 μl of proliferation medium. The cell clusters were triturated using a P200 pipetman about 100 times to break up the clusters. Cells were reseeded at 75,000-100,000 cells/ml into proliferation medium. Cells were passaged every 6-21 days depending upon the mitogens used and the seeding density. Typically these cells incorporate BrdU, indicative of cell proliferation. For T75 flask cultures (initial volume 20 ml), cells are "fed" 3 times weekly by addition of 5 ml of proliferation medium.
