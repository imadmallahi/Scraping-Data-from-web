HAVING AN INFLAMMATORY BASIS</p><p num="p0002"><sup>•</sup> "k ~k " ~k</p><p num="p0003">The present invention relates to compounds and the use thereof for diseases affecting the digestive apparatus, in particular the intestinal tract, specifically colites, gastrites, enterites, duodenites and hepatopathies of various nature (on a viral, immune, dismetabolic basis due to intoxications from drugs such as paracetamol and other analgesic, antibiotic, antitumoural, antidepressive drugs, etc., alcohol, etc.).</p><p num="p0004">The digestive apparatus diseases are very diffused. While the therapy of the peptic ulcer has generally reached efficacy, the same cannot be said for other diseases affecting the digestive apparatus. For example it is known that yearly in the Unites States more than 25 million people suffer diseases affecting liver and gall-bladder and more than 26,000 people die owing to chronic hepatopathies and cirrhosis. Generally the therapeutical treatment is widely unsatisfatory . -Among the compounds used for these treatments interferon α-2b can be mentioned, which allows the recovery in about 30-40% of the cases affected by chronic hepatitis B and 20-25% of those affected by chronic hepatitis C.</p><p num="p0005">However the interruption of the treatment causes a recidivism in 50-80% of the patients. Only 10% of the cases of hepatitis B are satisfactory with interferon α-2b. Another compound used for these pathologies is ribavirin, however the efficacy is not yet well known. Other used compounds are vaccines, which however are used only in the prophylaxis .</p><p num="p0006">For the cirrhosis treatment there are generally no

 effective compounds. At present the treatment is above all of support and it can consist in a suitable diet, alcohol abstinence or in the administering of diuretics or vitamins.</p><p num="p0007">The therapeutic treatment is generally unsatisf ctory for the diseases affecting the intestinal tract such colites, duodenites, enterites . For example the therapy with 5 -amino salicylic acid and derivatives thereof is not fully effective. The use of steroidal compounds (for example prednisolone and the like) can cause toxic symptoms or serious side effects.</p><p num="p0008">It must be added that generally the pathologies on an inflammatory basis, such as those above described affecting the digestive apparatus, are considered precancerous forms, since they can evolve into tumoural processes . In the same way for the pathologies on an inflammatory basis , which can concern different systems such the urogenital , respiratory apparatuses, the skin districts, etc.</p><p num="p0009">Therefore the treatment of these pathologies of inflammatory nature has a critical importance also in the prevention and in the treatment of tumoral diseases .</p><p num="p0010">The need was felt to have available compounds active in diseases on an inflammatory basis , in particular those affecting the digestive apparatus and for the prevention and/or treatment of the tumoral processes related to the above diseases .</p><p num="p0011">It has been surprisingly found by the Applicant that it is possible to solve the above technical problem with specific nitroderivatives as described hereunder.</p><p num="p0012">An object of the present invention is the use, for diseases on an inflammatory basis, of nitroderivatives or salts thereof having the following general formula (I):</p><p num="p0013">A-X.-L-(W)<sub>P</sub>-N0<sub>2</sub> (I) wherein: p is an integer equal to 1 or 0 ;
