compounds as stabilizing additives of perfluoropolyether oils
for their use at high temperatures.</p><p num="0002">More specifically the present invention relates to the
use of fluorinated compounds as stabilizing additives of perfluoropolyether
oils for their use at high temperatures, in
oxidizing environment and in the presence of metals.</p><p num="0003">It is known that perfluoropolyether fluids are lubricating
oils used also at high temperatures. However, said
fluids show the drawback that in oxidizing environment (for
example oxygen, air) and in the presence of metals they have
a limited thermal stability.</p><p num="0004">It is also known in the prior art that said drawback can
be reduced by adding to perfluoropolyether fluids stabilizing
additives. Said stabilizing additives are generally phosphor
compounds wherein substituents of perfluoroalkyl, perfluorooxyalkyl
and aromatic type are present. The synthesis of said
compounds is generally complex or uses reactants at a high
cost. The following patents can for example be mentioned. USP
4,681,693 describes stabilizers for perfluoropoly-ether
fluids having a structure formed by arylphosphines, or derivatives
thereof, linked to PFPE radicals through one oxygen
or sulphur atom. Said compounds are synthesized by a more
step process which includes intermediates difficult to be
prepared. EP 597,369 describes stabilizers for perfluoropolyether 
fluids based on substituted phosphazene derivatives,
where on the phosphazene ring both aromatic and
(per)fluoropolyether radicals are contemporaneously present.
The synthesis of said additives requires a double substitution
on the phosphazene ring. Besides the starting phosphazene
product has a high cost. This represents a further
drawback from the industrial point of view.</p><p num="0005">USP 5,326,910 describes perfluoropolyether phosphotriazine
derivatives as stabilizers for perfluoropolyether oils.
Said derivatives are synthesized with several steps, using
reactants of difficult preparation, such for example perfluorinated
epoxides.</p><p num="0006">USP 5,550,277 describes stabilizers for perfluoropolyether
fluids based on aromatic phosphates or phosphonates substituted
by perfluoropolyether groups. The synthesis process
is very complicated, it requires more steps and furthermore
it employes the use of metallo-organic reactants, such for
example butyl lithium, which are of difficult industrial use
for the problems related to the plant safety.</p><p num="0007">Patent application WO 99/51,612 describes new phosphoric
esters, in particular substituted arylphosphates, where at
least one of the substituents is a radical of perfluoropolyether
type.</p><p num="0008">In the preparation method of said additives, aromatic
phosphoric chloroesters, having a high cost, are used. As described 
in the Examples of the patent application, said
esters are obtained by reacting aromatic alcohols with POC1<sub>3</sub>,
which is a toxic and scalding substance, requiring specific
equipments for the use in an industrial scale.</p><p num="0009">According to the prior art the substances used as stabilizing
additives for perfluoropolyether oils contain phosphor
and are obtained by using, as seen, synthesis processes comprising
various steps or, alternatively, using expensive reactants.</p><p num="0010">The Applicant has surprisingly found additives which
even not containing phosphor in the molecule can be suitably
used as perfluoropolyether oil stabilizers at high temperatures,
even in oxidizing environment and in the presence of metals.
Furthermore said additives can be obtained with simplified
synthesis methods using cheap reactants.</p><p num="0011">An object of the present invention is the use as stabilizers
of perfluoropolyether lubricating oils at high temperatures,

the range 0-20, extremes included, m/n preferably being from

to USP 3,810,874, EP 165,649, EP 165,650, USP 3,250,807.

wherein Z, m and n are as above, with a suitable aromatic reactant
having the substituents X, Y, X' and Y' as defined in

case compound (B) with Z = &gt;C=O. See the above patents.</p><p num="0015">The formula (A) compounds of the present invention are
