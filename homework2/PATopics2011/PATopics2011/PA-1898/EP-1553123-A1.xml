represented by the formula (1), i.e. a novel
perfluoropolyether derivative, useful as a lubricant, a

widely used as a lubricating oil, a coating agent, etc.
Among such compounds, a derivative of which the terminal
group is -CH<sub>2</sub>OH is known to be particularly useful. For
example, a compound represented by the following formula
(A) (in the formula (A), each of a and b represents an
integer of at least 1) has been known (e.g. JP-A-6-44557
(page 2), C. Tonelli et al, J. Fluorine Chem., vol. 95,
1999, pages 51 to 70):
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">HOCH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>O-(CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>a</sub>·(CF<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>b</sub>-CF<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH</st32:che></p><p num="0003">However, the compound represented by the formula (A)
has -OCF<sub>2</sub>O- units derived from -(CF<sub>2</sub>O)- units as an
essential component in its molecular structure, and thus
it undergoes decomposition due to the above units, which
may cause deterioration (e.g. W. Fong et al, IEEE
Transactions on Magnetics, vol. 35, No. 2, March 1999,
pages 911 to 912, J. Scheirs, Modern Fluoropolymers, John 
Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., 1997, pages 466 to 468, P.H. Kasai,
Macromolecules, vol. 25, 1992, page 6791).</p><p num="0004">As a compound having no -OCF<sub>2</sub>O- units, a compound
wherein the terminal groups (-CH<sub>2</sub>OH) in the formula (A)
are -COOH groups, has been known. However, the compound
wherein the terminals are -COOH groups has such a
drawback that when it is exposed under high temperature
conditions, the polar terminal groups (-COOH) easily
undergo decarbonylation and are lost, and thus such
properties that the surface coating properties repair in
short time (also called self-repair properties) decrease.
Further, it has such a drawback that it may cause
corrosion since the -COOH groups have high acidity.</p><p num="0005">Further, there is a literature which discloses a
compound represented by the following formula (B) as a
surface active agent (JP-A-9-111286 (page 1)). However,
the literature does not disclose a compound represented
by the formula (B) wherein q is 0. Further, specifically
disclosed compounds are all known perfluoropolyether
surface active agents, and they correspond to compounds
wherein q is at least 1:

above problems, and it is an object of the present
invention to provide a compound represented by the

For example, a compound having a large number of these

organic solvent. Accordingly, when a solution
composition is formed, it is preferred to add a non-fluorine
solvent to the above fluorine-containing organic
solvent to adjust the solubility of the compound
