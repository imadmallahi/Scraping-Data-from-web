The compositions of the invention are to and the methods of the invention use hydroxy and ether-containing oxyalkylene esters.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Butyric acid (BA) is a natural product. It is supplied to mammals from two main sources: 1) the diet, mainly from dairy fat, and 2) from the bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates in the colon, where it reaches mM concentrations (Cummings, Gut 22:763-779, 1982; Leder et al., Cell 5:319-322, 1975).</p><p>BA has been known for nearly the last three decades to be a potent differentiating and antiproliferative agent in a wide spectra of neoplastic cells in vitro (Prasad, Life Sci. 27:1351-1358, 1980). In cancer cells, BA has been reported to induce cellular and biochemical changes, e.g., in cell morphology, enzyme activity, receptor expression and cell-surface antigens (Nordenberg et al., Exp. Cell Res. 162:77-85, 1986; Nordenberg et al., Br. J. Cancer 56:493-497, 1987; and Fishman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 254:4342-4344, 1979).</p><p>Although BA or its sodium salt (sodium butyrate, SB) has been the subject of numerous studies, its mode of action is unclear. The most specific effect of butyric acid is inhibition of nuclear deacetylase(s), resulting in hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 (Riggs, et al., Nature 263:462-464, 1977). Increased histone acetylation, following treatment with BA has been correlated with changes in transcriptional activity and the differentiated state of cells (Thorne et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 193:701-713, 1990). BA also exerts other nuclear actions, including modifications in the extent of phosphorylation (Boffa et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256:9612-9621, 1981) and methylation (Haan et al., Cancer Res. 46:713-716, 1986). Other cellular organelles, e.g., cytoskeleton and membrane composition and function, have been shown to be affected by BA (Bourgeade et al., J. Interferon Res. 1:323-332, 1981). Modulations in the expression of oncogenes and suppressor genes by BA were demonstrated in several cell types. Toscani et al., reported alterations in c-myc, p53 thymidine kinase, c-fos and AP2 in 3T3 fibroblasts (Oncogene Res. 3:223-238, 1988). A decrease in the expression of c-myc and H-ras oncogenes in B16 melanoma and in c-myc in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia was also reported (Prasad et al., Biochem. Cell Biol. 68:1250-1255, 1992; and Rabizadeh et al., FEBS Lett. 328:225-229, 1993).</p><p>BA has been reported to induce apoptosis, i.e., programmed cell death. SB has been shown to produce apoptosis in vitro in human colon carcinoma, leukemia and retinoblastoma cell lines (Bhatia et al., Cell Growth Diff. 6:937-944, 1995; Conway et al., Oncol. Res. 7:289-297, 1993; Hague et al.; Int. J. Cancer 60:400-406, 1995). Apoptosis is the physiological mechanism for the elimination of cells in a controlled and timely manner. Organisms maintain a delicate balance between cell proliferation and cell death, which when disrupted can tip the balance between cancer, in the case of over accumulation of cells, and degenerative diseases, in the case of premature cell losses. Hence, inhibition of apoptosis can contribute to tumor growth and promote progression of neoplastic conditions.</p><p>The promising in vitro antitumor effects of BA and BA salts led to the initiation of clinical trials for the treatment of cancer patients with observed minimal or transient efficacy [Novogrodsky et al., Cancer 51:9-14, 1983; Rephaeli et al., Intl. J. Oncol. 4:1387-1391, 1994; Miller et al., Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 23:1283-1287, 1987].</p><p>Clinical trials have been conducted for the treatment of β-globin disorders (e.g., β-thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia) using BA salts. The BA salts elevated expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), normally repressed in adults, and favorably modified the disease symptoms in these patients (Stamatoyannopouos et al., Ann. Rev. Med. 43:497-521, 1992). In this regard, arginine butyrate (AB) has been used in clinical trials with moderate efficacy (Perrine et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 328:81-86, 1993; Sher et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 332:1606-1610, 1995). The reported side effects of AB included hypokalemia, headache, nausea and vomiting in β-thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia patients.</p><p>Butyric acid derivatives with antitumor activity and immunomodulatory properties have been reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,553 and by Nudelman et al., 1992, J. Med. Chem. 35:687-694. The most active buryric acid prodrug reported in these references was pivaloyloxymethyl butyrate (AN-9). Similar compounds are reported for treating hemoglobinopathies (U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,675).</p><p>BA and/or its analogues have also been reported to increase the expression of transfected DNA (Carstea et al., 1993, Biophys. Biochem. Res. Comm. 192:649; Cheng et al., 1995, Am. J. Physical 268:L615-L624) and to induce tumor-restricted gene expression by adenovirus vectors (Tang et al., 1994, Cancer Gene Therapy 1:15-20). Tributyrin has been reported to enhance the expression of a reporter gene in primary and immortalized cell lines (Smith et al., 1995, Biotechniques 18:852-835).</p><p>However, BA and its salts are normally metabolized rapidly and have very short half-lives in vivo, thus the achievement and maintenance of effective plasma concentrations are problems associated with BA and BA salts, particularly for in vivo uses. BA and BA salts have required large doses to achieve even minimal therapeutic effects. Because of the high dosage, fluid overload and mild alkalosis may occur. Patients receiving BA eminate an unpleasant odor that is socially unacceptable.</p><p>While BA salts have been shown to increase HbF expression, and appear to hold therapeutic promise with low toxicity in cancer patients, they nevertheless have shown low potency in in vitro assays and clinical trials. There remains a need to identify compounds as effective or more effective than BA or BA salts as differentiating or anti-proliferating agents for the treatment of cancers. Such compounds need to have higher potency than BA without the problems associated with BA (such as bad odor). This need can be addressed by therapeutic compounds that either deliver BA to cells in a longer acting form or which have similar activity as BA but a longer duration of effectiveness in vivo.</p><p>The compounds of this invention address these needs and are more potent than BA or BA salts for treating of cancers and other proliferative diseases, for treating gastrointestinal disorders, for wound healing, for treating blood disorders such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia and other anemias, for modulating an immune response, for enhancing recombinant gene expression, for treating insulin-dependent patients, for treating cystic fibrosis patients, for inhibiting telomerase activity, for treating virus-associated tumors, especially EBV-associated tumors, for modulating gene expression and particularly for augmenting expression of a tumor suppressor gene, for inducing tolerance to an antigen, for treating, preventing or ameliorating protozoan infection and for inhibiting histone deacetylase in cells. For example, one of the advantages of the compounds of the invention is increased hydrophilicity and thus easier administration, especially for intravenous administration.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention is directed to compounds represented by the formula ##STR1## wherein R is C.sub.1 to C.sub.10 alkyl, C.sub.2 to C.sub.10 alkenyl or C.sub.2 to C.sub.10 alkynyl, optionally substituted with hydroxy, alkoxy, halo, trifluoromethyl, aryl or heteroaryl;</p><p>R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are independently H, C.sub.1 -C.sub.10 alkyl, C.sub.2 -C.sub.10 alkenyl, or C.sub.2 -C.sub.10 alkynyl, any of which can be optionally substituted with halo, alkoxy, amino, trifluoromethyl, aryl or heteroaryl;</p><p>R.sup.3 is</p><p>(1) C.sub.1 -C.sub.12 alkyl or C.sub.2 -C.sub.10 alkenyl substituted with from one to ten substituents selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, alkoxy, acyloxy, aroyloxy and aryloxy, and, optionally having one or more halo groups, wherein adjacent hydroxy groups, if present, can optionally be present as an acetonide,</p><p>(2) --(CH.sub.2).sub.n -[O--(CH.sub.2).sub.p ].sub.m -OR.sup.4,</p><p>(3) --(CH.sub.2).sub.n -PEG-OR.sup.4, or</p><p>(4) --(CH.sub.2).sub.n -PPG-OR.sup.4 ;</p><p>R.sup.4 is C.sub.1 to C.sub.6 alkyl, C.sub.2 to C.sub.6 alkenyl, aryl, acyl, aroyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl or ##STR2## PEG is a polyethylene glycol moiety having an average molecular weight of 200-8000;</p><p>PPG is a polypropylene glycol moiety having an average molecular weight of 200-8000;</p><p>p is 2 to 4;</p><p>n is 1 to 5;</p><p>m is 1 to 6; and</p><p>pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof;</p><p>with the proviso that when R is alkyl, R.sup.3 can not be monohydroxy-n-propyl.</p><p>The above compounds are referred to herein as "Formula I compounds."

The above reagents are readily prepared according to literature procedures, see for example, Nudelman et al., J. Med. Chem. 35:687-694, 1992, and Japanese patent 07033709 (1995). The base can be a trialkylamine, pyridine, an alkali metal carbonate or other suitable base. The reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of an inert solvent. Suitable solvents include, for example, acetone, benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, chloroform, dioxan or 1,2-dichloroethane.</p><p>The procedures outlined above can be improved by one skilled in the art by, for instance, changing the temperature, duration, stoichiometry or other parameters of the reactions. Any such changes are intended to fall within the scope of this invention.</p><heading>ACTIVITY</heading><p>The activities of the compounds of the invention can be measured using generally-accepted techniques known to those skilled in the art consistent with the activity of interest. For example, the activity of compounds useful as differentiating agents can be measured using standard methodology of the nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction assay (e.g., Rabizadeh et al., FEBS Lett. 328:225-229, 1993; Chomienne et al., Leuk. Res. 10:631, 1986; and Breitman et al. in Methods for Serum-free Culture of Neuronal and Lymphoid Cells, Alan R. Liss, NY, p. 215-236, 1984 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety) and as described below. This in vitro assay has been deemed to be predictive and in fact correlative with in vivo efficacy (Castaigne et al., Blood 76:1704-1709, 1990).</p><p>Another assay which is predictive of differentiating activity is the morphological examination for the presence of Auer rods and/or specific differentiation cell surface antigens in cells collected from treatment groups, as described in Chomienne et al., (Blood 76:1710-1717, 1990 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) and as described below.</p><p>The compounds of the present invention also have anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activity. The anti-proliferation activity of compounds of the present invention can be determined by methods generally known to those skilled in the art. Generally-accepted assays for measuring viability and anti-proliferative activity are the trypan blue exclusion test and incorporation of tritiated thymidine, also as described by Chomienne, et al., above, which is incorporated herein by reference. Other assays which predict and correlate antitumor activity and in vivo efficacy are the human tumor colony forming assay described in Shoemaker et al., Can. Res. 45:2145-2153, 1985, and inhibition of telomerase activity as described by Hiyayama et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 87:895-908, 1995, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. These assays are described in further detail below.</p><p>Cell Cultures</p><p>Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), human pancreatic carcinoma cells (PaCa-2) and human breast adenocarcinoma cells, pleural effusion cells (MCF-7) can be cultured as follows. Cells are grown in RPMI media with 10% FCS, supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and incubated at 37 C. in a humidified 5% CO.sub.2 incubator. Alternatively, cells can be grown in any other appropriate growth medium and conditions which supports the growth of the cell line under investigation. Viability can be determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells are exposed to a test compound, cultures are harvested at various time points following treatment and stained with trypan blue.</p><p>Cellular Staining to Detect Differentiation</p><p>Lipid staining and/or immunochemical staining of casein can be used as a marker for cellular differentiation of breast cancer cells (Bacus et al., Md. Carcin. 3:350-362, 1990). Casein detection can be done by histochemical staining of breast cancer cells using a human antibody to human casein as described by Cheung et al., J. Clin. Invest. 75:1722-1728, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p>Nitro-Blue Tetrazolium (NBT) Assay:</p><p>Cell differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells can be evaluated, for example, by NBT reduction activity as follows. Cell cultures are grown in the presence of a test compound for the desired time period. The culture medium is then brought to 0.1% NBT and the cells are stimulated with 400 mM of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). After incubation for 30 min at 37 least 200 cells. The capacity for cells to reduce NBT is assessed as the percentage of cells containing intracellular reduced black formazan deposits and corrected for viability.</p><p>Cell Surface Antigen Immunophenotyping</p><p>Cell surface antigen immunotyping can be conducted using dual-color fluorescence of cells gated according to size. The expression of a panel of antigens from early myeloid (CD33) to late myeloid can be determined as described in Warrell, Jr. et al., New Engl. J. Med. 324:1385-1392, 1992, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p>Apoptosis Evaluation</p><p>Apoptosis can be evaluated by DNA fragmentation, visible changes in nuclear structure or immunocytochemical analysis of Bcl-2 expression.</p><p>DNA fragmentation can be monitored by the appearance of a DNA ladder on an agarose gel. For example, cellular DNA is isolated and analyzed by the method of Martin et al., J. Immunol., 145:1859-1867, 1990 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p>Changes in nuclear structure can be assessed, for example, by acridine orange staining method of Hare et al., J. Hist. Cyt., 34:215-220, 1986 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p>Immunological detection of Bcl-2 can be performed on untreated cells and cells treated with the test compound. HL-60 cells are preferred but other cell lines capable of expressing Bcl-2 can be used. Cytospins are prepared and the cells are fixed with ethanol. Fixed cells are reacted overnight at 4 dilution of 1:50. Staining is completed to visualize antibody binding, for example, using Strep A-B Universal Kit (Sigma) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Identically-treated cells which received no primary antibody can serve as a non-specific binding control. Commercial kits are also available and can be used for detecting apoptosis, for example, Oncor's Apop Tag</p><p>Modulation of Gene Expression</p><p>The levels of expression from oncogene and tumor suppressor genes can be evaluated by routine methods known in the art such as Northern blotting of RNA, immunoblotting of protein and PCR amplification.</p><p>Mouse Cancer Model</p><p>Compounds can be examined for their ability to increase the life span of animals bearing B16 melanomas, Lewis lung carcinomas and myelomonocytic leukemias as described in Nudelman et al., J. Med. Chem. 35:687-694, 1992, or Rephaeli et al., Int. J. Cancer 49:66-72, 1991, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><p>For example, the efficacy of compounds of the present invention in a leukemia model can be tested as follows: Balb/c mice are injected with WEHI cells and a test compound or control solution is administered the following day. The life span of the treated animals is compared to that of untreated animals.</p><p>The efficacy of compounds of the present invention on primary tumors can also be tested with subcutaneously implanted lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma by measuring the mass of the tumor at the site of implantation every two weeks in control and treated animals.</p><p>The efficacy of compounds in xenografts can be determined by implanting the human tumor cells subcutaneously into athymic mice. Human tumor cell lines which can be used include, but are not limited to, prostate carcinoma (human Pc-3 cells), pancreatic carcinoma (human Mia PaCa cells), colon adenocarcinoma (human HCT-15 cells) and mammary adenocarcinoma (human MX-1 cells). Treatment with control solution or a test compound of the invention begins, for example, when tumors are approximately 100 mg. Anti-tumor activity is assessed by measuring the delay in tumor growth, and/or tumor shrinking and/or increased survival of the treated animals relative to control animals.</p><p>Telomerase Activity</p><p>High levels of telomerase activity is associated with the high proliferation rate found in cancer cells. Compounds which inhibit telomerase activity results in inhibition of cancer cell growth and de-differentiation. Commercially available telomerase assays can thus be used to assess the anticancer activities of compounds on cancer cell lines.</p><p>Chemoprevention</p><p>The chemoprevention activity of the compounds of the invention can be determined in the two-stage mouse carcinogenesis model of Nishimo et al. (supra).</p><p>Assay of Compounds</p><p>Compounds of the invention, their salts or metabolites, can be measured in a biological sample by any method known to those skilled in the art of pharmacology, clinical chemistry or the like. Such methods for measuring these compounds are standard methods and include, but are not limited to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and others.</p><p>Dosage and Formulation</p><p>The compounds of the present invention can be administered to a mammalian patient to treat cancer or in any other method of the invention which involves treating a patient by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agent's site of action in the body of the subject. Mammalian patients include humans and domestic animals. The compounds of the invention can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. The compounds can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be adapted for oral, parenteral, transdermal, transmucosal, rectal or intranasal administration, and may be in unit dosage form, as is well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical art. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection or infusion techniques.</p><p>The appropriate dosage administered in any given case will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the age, general health, metabolism, weight of the recipient and other factors which influence response to the compound; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; and the effect desired. A daily dosage of active ingredient can be expected to be about 10 to 10,000 milligrams per meter.sup.2 of body mass (mg/m.sup.2), with the preferred dose being 50-5,000 mg/m.sup.2 body mass.</p><p>Dosage forms (compositions suitable for administration) contain from about 1 mg to about 1 g of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.</p><p>The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid or semi-solid dosage forms, such as for example hard or soft-gelatin capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, disperse powders or granules, emulsions, and aqueous or oily suspensions. It can also be administered parenterally, in sterile liquid dosage forms. Other dosage forms include transdermal administration via a patch mechanism or ointment.</p><p>Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any methods known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, and preserving agents in order to provide a pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation.</p><p>Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. Such excipients may include, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium phosphate, or lactose; granulating disintegrating agents, for example, maize starch or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acids or talc. Compressed tablets may be uncoated or may be sugar coated or film coated by known techniques to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Hard gelatin capsules or liquid filled soft gelatin capsules contain the active ingredient and inert powdered or liquid carriers, such as, but not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, kaolin, lactose, lecithin starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, arachis oil, liquid paraffin, olive oil, pharmaceutically-accepted synthetic oils and other diluents suitable for the manufacture of capsules. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release-products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours.</p><p>Aqueous suspensions contain the active compound in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, e.g., sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth, and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents, such as a naturally occurring phosphatide, e.g., lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example of polyoxyethylene stearate, or a condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol, e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or a condensation product of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin, or sodium or calcium cyclamate.</p><p>Dispersable powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, sweetening, flavoring, and coloring agents, can also be present.</p><p>Syrups and elixirs can be formulated with sweetening agents, such as glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.</p><p>In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), polysorbate and related sugar solutions, emulsions, such as Intralipid such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Antioxidizing agents, such as but not limited to sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used can be citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as but not limited to benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention also include compositions for delivery across cutaneous or mucosal epithelia including transdermal, intranasal, sublingual, buccal, and rectal administration. Such compositions may be part of a transdermal device, patch, topical formulation, gel, etc., with appropriate excipients.

Cells were grown to 70-80% confluence in complete media [RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 100 IU penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine], harvested, washed in complete media, and counted. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cells were placed into soft agar (0.12% in media) and plated at 5,000 viable cells per well onto an agarose underlayer (0.4%) in 24-well plates. After overnight culture, AB or Compound C was added at the indicated concentration. Control cells received media alone. As a control for cell death, cells were treated with a superlethal dose of 10 μg/ml of cisplatin. The dosage of AB or Compound C which inhibited fifty percent (or ninety percent) of cell proliferation (IC.sub.50 or IC.sub.90) was calculated using the Chou Analysis' Median Effective Dose equation.</p><p>Clonogenicity is determined as the percentage of clones in treated cultures relative to clones in media-treated control cultures. The IC.sub.50 and IC.sub.90 values of AB and Compound C for the neuroblastoma cancer cell lines are provided in Table 2.</p><p>The results demonstrate that Compound C is a more potent growth inhibitor than AB. The data show that Compound C and AB inhibit cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner but that the cells are at least an order of magnitude more sensitive to Compound C. The ratio of IC.sub.50 AB:IC.sub.50 Compound C ranges between 6.5- to 77-fold with a median of 34 μM. Similarly the ratio of IC.sub.90 AB:IC.sub.90 Compound C ranges between 5.8- to 342-fold with a median value of 36 μM.
