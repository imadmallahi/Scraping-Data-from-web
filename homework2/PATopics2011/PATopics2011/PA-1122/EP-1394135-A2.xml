compressive strength and low permeability, basically comprised of particulate acid
degradable glass, water, at least one water soluble polyalkenoic acid, or at least one water
soluble polymerizable alkenoic acid monomer and a water soluble free-radical initiator.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention relates generally to methods and compositions for cementing in
wellbores.</p> <p num="0002">Hydraulic cement compositions are commonly utilized in subterranean well
completion and remedial operations. For example, hydraulic cement compositions are used
in primary cementing operations whereby pipe strings such as casings and liners are
cemented in wellbores. In performing primary cementing, a hydraulic cement composition is
pumped into the annular space between the walls of a wellbore and the exterior surfaces of a
pipe string disposed therein. The cement composition is permitted to set in the annular space
thereby forming an annular sheath of hard substantially impermeable cement therein. The
cement sheath physically supports and positions the pipe string in the wellbore and bonds the
exterior surfaces of the pipe string to the walls of the wellbore whereby the undesirable
migration of fluids between zones or formations penetrated by the wellbore is prevented.</p> <p num="0003">Multi-lateral wells have been developed which include vertical or deviated principal
wellbores having one or more ancillary laterally extending wellbores connected thereto.
Drilling and completion equipment is available which allows multiple-laterals to be drilled
from a principal cased and cemented wellbore. Each of the lateral wellbores can include a
liner cemented therein which is tied into the principal wellbore.</p> <p num="0004">While conventional hydraulic cement compositions which are basically comprised of
a hydraulic cement, e.g., Portland cement, water, and various conventional cement additives
have been used successfully in primary cementing and other well cementing applications, in
some well cementing applications a cement composition is required that upon setting has a
higher compressive strength and lower permeability than conventional hydraulic cement
compositions. Examples of well cement applications which require very high strength and
very low permeability cement include, but are not limited to, cemented multi-lateral
junctions, kick-off or whip-stock plugs which are placed in a wellbore to deflect the drill bit
of a drill string and start directional drilling, cement plugs set on top of mechanical bridge
plugs used to shut-off lower zones, plugs set in wellbores to seal the wellbores when the
wells are abandoned and in remedial applications such as squeeze cementing where a cement
is pressured into cracks, holes or other openings in casings or liners, cement sheaths sealing
the liners in the wellbore and the like. </p><p num="0005">There are needs for improved cement compositions for use in wellbores which have
very high compressive strengths and very low permeabilities.</p><p num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of cementing in a subterranean
zone, which method comprises placing a cement composition comprising an acid degradable
glass in said subterranean zone; and allowing said composition to solidify.</p><p num="0007">Preferably, the cement composition further comprises sufficient water to form a slurry
and a water soluble polyalkenoic acid; and wherein said polyalkenoic acid reacts with said
acid degradable glass to form a cement mass in said zone.</p><p num="0008">Alternatively, the cement composition further comprises sufficient water to form a
slurry, at least one water soluble polymerizable alkenoic acid monomer and a water soluble
free-radical initiator; and wherein said free-radical initiator causes said alkenoic acid
monomer to polymerize and react with said acid degradable glass to form a cement mass in
said zone.</p><p num="0009">The invention also includes a well cement composition comprising particulate acid
degradable glass, sufficient water to form a slurry, at least one water soluble polymerizable
alkenoic acid monomer and a water soluble free-radical initiator.</p><p num="0010">The present invention provides methods and compositions for cementing in
subterranean zones penetrated by wellbores. The cement compositions can be elastic or they
can have very high compressive strength and very low permeability. The methods and
cement compositions of this invention are useful in a variety of well cementing applications
such as cementing multi-lateral junctions, forming kick-off or whip-stock plugs in wellbores
to deflect drill bits and start directional drilling, cementing bridge plugs in wellbores to shut
off lower zones, cementing wellbores to form plugs therein when the wellbores are
abandoned and remedial applications in wellbores whereby holes, cracks and the like in
casing and cement are repaired by squeeze cementing techniques. A quick setting cement
composition which can be utilized in accordance with the methods of this invention is
basically comprised of particulate acid degradable glass, sufficient water to form a slurry and
a water soluble polyalkenoic acid. The polyalkenoic acid reacts with the particulate acid
degradable glass and relatively quickly sets and forms a strong impermeable solid cement.</p><p num="0011">An improved cement composition of this invention which can be utilized in
applications in which the set of the cement composition must be delayed to allow its
placement in a subterranean zone is basically comprised of a particulate acid degradable 
glass, sufficient water to form a slurry, at least one water soluble polymerizable alkenoic acid
monomer and a water soluble free-radical polymerization initiator.</p><p num="0012">The particulate acid degradable glass is different from well-known soda-lime glass.
Acid degradable glass is a calcium alumino silicate material which is a commercially
available glass that is mixed with fluoride and utilized in dental applications. The fluoride in
the acid degradable glass used by dentists is for preventing tooth decay and is not necessary
in well applications. Calcium alumino silicate glass is also available as a slag by-product
from coal gasification processes. As the name implies, acid degradable glass is degraded by
and reacts with certain acids when in contact therewith. The acid degradable glass is present
in the cement compositions described above in an amount in the range of from about 2.5% to
about 85% by weight of the composition.</p><p num="0013">The water in the cement compositions of this invention can be fresh water or
saltwater. The term "saltwater" is used herein to mean unsaturated salt solutions and
saturated salt solutions including brines and seawater. The water is present in the cement
compositions in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 40% by weight of the
compositions.</p><p num="0014">The water soluble polyalkenoic acids which can be utilized in the quick setting
cement compositions described above include, but are not limited to, homopolymers or
copolymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid and 2-butene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic
acid. Of these, polyacrylic acid or polymethacrylic acid is preferred. The
polyalkenoic acid is present in the cement compositions in an amount in the range of from
about 5% to about 15% by weight of the compositions.</p><p num="0015">The water soluble polymerizable alkenoic acid monomer or monomers in the delayed
set compositions of this invention can be alkenoic acid monomers selected from the group
consisting of acrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, methacrylic acid, 2-butene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic
acid and mixtures thereof. Of these, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid is
preferred. The one or more water soluble alkenoic acid monomers can be alkenoic acid esters
which are delayed by requiring hydrolysis before polymerizing and reacting with the acid
degradable glass. Examples of the alkenoic acid esters which can be utilized include, but are
not limited to, hydroxyethyl acrylate ester, hydroxyethyl methacrylate ester, hydroxypropyl
acrylate ester, hydroxypropyl methacrylate ester and mixtures thereof. Of these,
hydroxyethyl acrylate ester is preferred. The one or more water soluble polymerizable 
alkenoic acid monomers or esters utilized are included in the cement compositions of this
invention in an amount in the range of from about 5% to about 15% by weight of the
compositions.</p><p num="0016">A variety of water-soluble free-radical polymerization initiators can be utilized in the
delayed set compositions. A particularly suitable type of free-radical initiator is an azo
polymerization initiator. Azo polymerization initiators are defined by the formulas set forth
in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,335,726 issued to Rodrigues on August 9, 1994 which is
incorporated herein by reference thereto. The azo polymerization initiators are commercially
available from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. of Osaka, Japan and Wako Chemicals
USA, Inc. of Richmond, Virginia. The azo initiators have 10 hour half-lives at temperatures
ranging from about 110°F to about 220°F. Accordingly, by determining the temperature of
the formation into which the cement composition of this invention is to be placed and the
required pumping time, an azo initiator type and concentration can be selected for
polymerization initiation which provides an induction period sufficient to allow the cement to
be placed.</p><p num="0017">Particularly suitable azo free radical initiators include, but are not limited to, 1-[(1-cyano-1-methylethyl)azo]formamide
(10 hour half life temperature 219°F), 2,2'-azobis[2-(5-methyl-2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]
dihydrochloride (10 hour half life temperature 106°F),
2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (10 hour half life temperature 133°F),
2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride (10 hour half life temperature
111°F), 2,2'-azobis[2-methyl-N-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)propionamide] (10 hour half life
temperature 187°F) and 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (10 hour half life temperature
156°F).</p><p num="0018">When an alkenoic acid or a delayed alkenoic acid ester is utilized in the cement
compositions, the water-soluble free-radical initiator can be an oxidizing compound.
Examples of such oxidizing free-radical initiators include, but are not limited to, sodium
persulfate, ammonium persulfate, t-butylhydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide with or
without a reducing agent selected from the group consisting of sodium thiosulfate, sodium
bisulfite and triethanolamine.</p><p num="0019">Generally, the water soluble free-radical initiator utilized is present in the cement
compositions in an amount in the range of from about 0.001% to about 0.25% by weight of
the compositions. </p><p num="0020">The quick set and delayed set cement compositions can also include a filler comprised
of silica flour or powdered iron oxide. When used, the filler is present in the cement
compositions in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 1900% by weight of the
acid degradable glass therein. The presence of relatively large amounts of filler in the cement
compositions makes the cement compositions elastic. For example, when a cement
composition of this invention includes a ratio of iron oxide filler to acid degradable glass in
the range of from about 3:1 to about 19:1, the resulting set cement composition has elastic
properties.</p><p num="0021">The methods of this invention for cementing in a subterranean zone penetrated by a
wellbore are basically comprised of the following steps. A cement composition is provided
comprised of particulate acid degradable glass, sufficient water to form a slurry, and a
polyalkenoic acid, or alternatively when it is necessary to delay the set of the cement
composition, at least one water soluble polymerizable alkenoic acid monomer and a water
soluble free-radical initiator. The cement composition is placed in a subterranean zone to be
cemented and then allowed to set into a strong impermeable solid cement mass in the
subterranean zone.</p><p num="0022">The mechanism by which the delayed set cement compositions of this invention set is
as follows. The free-radical polymerization initiator causes the one or more alkenoic acid
monomers to polymerize. The resulting alkenoic acid polymer then reacts with the acid
degradable glass to form a strong impermeable solid cement mass. While the alkenoic acid
monomer or monomers may react with the acid degradable glass prior to the polymerization,
that reaction does not cause a set.</p><p num="0023">A preferred method of this invention for cementing in a subterranean zone penetrated
by a wellbore where a quick set is required comprises the steps of: (a) providing a cement
composition comprised of particulate acid degradable glass, sufficient water to form a slurry
and a water soluble polyalkenoic acid; (b) placing the cement composition in the
subterranean zone; and (c) allowing the polyalkenoic acid to react with the acid degradable
glass and set into a strong impermeable solid cement mass in the zone.</p><p num="0024">Another preferred method of the present invention for cementing in a subterranean
zone penetrated by a wellbore where a delayed set is required comprises the steps of:
<sl><li>(a) providing a cement composition comprised of particulate acid degradable glass, sufficient
water to form a slurry, at least one water soluble polymerizable alkenoic acid monomer and a 
water soluble free-radical initiator; (b) placing the cement composition in the subterranean
zone; and (c) allowing the free-radical initiator to cause the alkenoic acid monomer to
polymerize and react with the acid degradable glass and set into a strong impermeable solid
cement mass in the zone.</li></sl></p><p num="0025">A preferred well cement composition of this invention is comprised of particulate acid
degradable glass, sufficient water to form a slurry, at least one water soluble polymerizable
alkenoic acid monomer and a water soluble free-radical initiator.</p><p num="0026">In order to further illustrate the methods and compositions of this invention the
following example is given.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading><p num="0027">A cement composition was prepared by combining a 30% by weight water solution of
a copolymer of acrylic acid and itaconic acid having a weight ratio of acrylic acid to itaconic
acid of 7:3 with particulate acid degradable glass. The particulate acid degradable glass was
combined with the copolymer solution in a weight ratio of copolymer solution to particulate
acid degradable glass of 1:1. The resulting composition was cured for 24 hours at 73°F after
which the composition was tested for compressive strength. The test result was that the
composition had a compressive strength of 2912 psi.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading><p num="0028">A first cement composition of this invention was prepared by dissolving a methacrylic
acid monomer in water in an amount to produce an aqueous solution containing 30% by
weight methacrylic acid. An azo initiator, i.e., 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)
dihydrochloride was added to the monomer solution in an amount equivalent to 40 pounds of
initiator per 1,000 gallons of the monomer solution. Particulate acid degradable glass was
added to the monomer solution in a weight ratio of aqueous solution to particulate acid
degradable glass of 1:1. A second cement composition was prepared which was identical to
the first cement composition except that a 1:1 mixture of silica flour and acid degradable
glass was used in place of the acid degradable glass. The resulting cement compositions were
cured for 18 hours at 140°F after which the set cement compositions were tested for
compressive strength. The compressive strength of the first cement composition which did
not contain silica flour was 5,343 psi and the compressive strength of the second cement
composition containing silica flour was 4,978 psi. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading><p num="0029">A first cement composition of this invention was prepared by dissolving acrylic acid
monomer in water in an amount to produce an aqueous solution containing 30% by weight
acrylic acid. A 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride initiator was added to
the monomer solution in an amount equivalent to 40 pounds of initiator per 1,000 gallons of
the monomer solution. Particulate acid degradable glass was added to the monomer solution
in a weight ratio of aqueous solution to particulate acid degradable glass of 1:1. A second
cement composition was prepared which was identical to the first cement composition except
that a 1:1 mixture of silica flour and acid degradable glass was used in place of the acid
degradable glass. A third cement composition was prepared which was identical to the first
cement composition except that a 1:1 mixture of powdered iron oxides and acid degradable
glass was used in place of the acid degradable glass. The resulting cement compositions were
cured for 18 hours at 140°F after which the set cement compositions were tested for
compressive strength. The compressive strength of the first cement composition which did
not contain silica flour or powdered iron oxide was 2,100 psi. The compressive strength of
the second cement composition which contained silica flour was 3,170 psi and the
compressive strength of the third cement composition which contained powdered iron oxide
was 2,920 psi.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 4</heading><p num="0030">A cement composition was prepared by dissolving acrylic acid in a 0.4% aqueous
solution of xanthan gum to produce an aqueous solution containing 30% acrylic acid. 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)
dihydrochloride initiator was added to the monomer
solution in an amount equivalent to 0.1% w/v. A 95:5 mixture of powdered iron oxides and
acid degradable glass was added to the monomer solution in a weight ratio of aqueous
solution to solids of 1:1. The resulting cement composition was cured at 140°F for 72 hours.
The cement was compressed in a load cell to 24% of its original length without failing (730
psi maximum stress based on the original cross-sectional area). Within 1 hour of removing
the sample from the load cell, it had recovered 99% of its original length, demonstrating the
elastic characteristic of the cement.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>A method of cementing in a subterranean zone, which method comprises placing a
