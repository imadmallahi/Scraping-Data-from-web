As a result, it has been found that the stability of vitamin A is extremely improved by formulating the specified stabilizer therein. Thus the present invention has been achieved.</p><p>The present invention will be described in detail below.</p><p>As vitamin A used in the present invention, vitamin A (also called retinol), all-trans type vitamin A or 13-cis type vitamin A is desirable. A mixture thereof can also be used.</p><p>The amount of vitamin A to be formulated into the external skin treatment composition according to the present invention is not particularly limited. However, if the effect on the skin as a function of vitamin A is taking into consideration, the amount is 0.0001% by weight or more, based upon the total weight of the composition. If further effects of vitamin A are required, 0.001% by weight or more of the same is preferably used. The upper limit of the formulation amount is preferably 1% by weight in view of the properties as an external skin treatment composition.</p><p>According to the first embodiment of the present invention, as a stabilizer, the combination of a chelating agent and a polysaccharide is used.</p><p>As a chelating agent used in the present invention, mention may be made of inorganic alkali salts of ethylenediaminetetraacetate such as sodium salts and potassium salts thereof, organic alkali salts of ethylenediaminetetraacetate such as ethanolamines salts thereof (mono, di, tri and tetra salts), citric acid and inorganic alkali salts of citric acid such as sodium and potassium salts thereof, organic alkali salts of citric acid such as ethanolamine salts and basic amino acid salts thereof (mono, di, tri salts); metaphosphoric acid salts, polyphosphoric acid salts, tartaric acid salts.</p><p>The amount of a chelating agent to be formulated in accordance with the present invention is 0.001% by weight or more and the upper limit of the formulation amount cannot be particularly limited. However, when an extremely large amount of the agent is formulated, although the effects of the present invention are not impaired, crystals of the agent are possibly deposited or undesirable phenomena may occur, so that qualities as external skin treatment compositions cannot be maintained. The formulation amount is preferably 1% by weight or less.</p><p>As polysaccharides used in the present invention, mention may be made of cellulose, quinsseed, chondroitin sulfate, starch, galactan, dermatan sulfate, glycogen, gum arabic, heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, gum traganth, keratan sulfate, chondroitin, gum xanthane, mucoitin sulfate, guargum, dextran, keratosulfate, locust bean gum, succinoglucan, charonin, and the salts thereof.</p><p>The amount of polysaccharides to be formulated into the external skin treatment composition of the present invention is not particularly limited in view of the effects of the present invention. However, it is preferably 0.00001 to 5.0% by weight.</p><p>In the second embodiment of the present invention, as oils having an iodine value of 70 or more to be formulated as a stabilizer, typically, mention may be made of plant oils belonging to the drying oil group such as linseed oil, tung oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, walnut oil, eno oil, evening primrose oil, cherrykernel oil and grape seed; plant oils belonging to the nondrying oil such as sesame oil, rape seed oil, cotton seed oil, rice bran oil and wheat embryo bud oil; avocado oil; olive oil; camellia oil; macadamia nut oil; fish oils such as sardine oil, mackerel oil, herring oil, cod-liver oil, oyster oil.</p><p>In these oils, iodine values are, for example, 168-190 in linseed oil, 114-138 in soybean oil, 122-150 in sunflower oil, 94-107 in rape seed oil, 90-121 in cotton seed oil, 75-90 in olive oil, 73-87 in camellia oil, 136-195 in sardine oil, 99-119 in herring oil.</p><p>Further, among free fatty acids and higher alcohols derived from these fats and oils, those having an iodine value of 70 or more include, for example, oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eleostearic acid, γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaene acid, oleyl alcohol.</p><p>One or more kinds of these oils are formulated into the composition. The formulation amount thereof for the purpose of exhibiting the effects of the present invention is preferably 0.01% by weight or more. Further, even if an excess amount of the same is formulated, the effects of the present invention are not impaired. However, if an extremely large amount of the same is formulated, qualities as external skin treatment compositions sometimes can be impaired. Thus caution should be taken not to impair the qualities. The formulation amount is particularly preferably 0.1 to 60% by weight.</p><p>According to the third embodiment of the present invention, as a stabilizer, one or two or more kinds of compounds selected from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and/or polypropylene glycol (PPG) are formulated.</p><p>As PEG, PPG to be formulated in accordance with the present invention, PEG200, PEG300, PEG400, PEG1500, PEG4000, PEG6000, PEG20000 as well as PPG400, PPG750, PPG1200, PPG2000, PPG3000 have been typically known.</p><p>One or more kinds of these compounds are formulated into the composition. The formulation amount thereof for the purpose of exhibiting the effects of the present invention is preferably 0.1% by weight or more. Further, even if an excess amount of the same is formulated, the effects of the present invention are not impaired. However, if an extremely large amount of the same is formulated, qualities as external skin treatment compositions sometimes can be impaired. Thus caution should be taken not to impair the qualities of the composition. The formulation amount is particularly preferably 1 to 80% by weight.</p><p>In the fourth embodiment of the present invention, as hydroxycarbonates included in the external skin treatment composition as a stabilizer, mention may be made of inorganic alkali salts such as sodium salts and potassium salts of citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid and tartaric acid, organic alkali salts such as ethanolamine salts and basic amino acid salts of citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid and tartaric acid (mono, di and tri salts are typically known).</p><p>One or two or more kinds thereof are included in the present composition. The formulation amount thereof for the purpose of exhibiting the effects of the present invention is preferably 0.001% by weight or more. Further, even if an excess amount of the same is formulated, the effects of the present invention are not impaired. However, if an extremely large amount of the same is formulated, qualities as external skin treatment compositions sometimes can be impaired. Thus caution should be taken not to impair the qualities of the composition. The formulation amount is particularly preferably 0.01 to 1% by weight.</p><p>In the fifth embodiment of the present invention, as neutral amino acids included in the external skin treatment composition as a stabilizer, mention may be made of glycine, alanine, seline, phenylalanine, proline and hydroxyproline.</p><p>One or two or more kinds thereof are included in the present composition. The formulation amount thereof for the purpose of exhibiting the effects of the present invention is preferably 0.001% by weight or more. Further, even if an excess amount of the same is formulated, the effects of the present invention are not impaired. However, if an extremely large amount of the same is formulated, the formulation amount exceeds individual solubility to possibly cause the precipitation of the crystals so that qualities as external skin treatment compositions sometimes can be impaired. Thus caution should be taken not to impair the qualities of the composition. The formulation amount is particularly preferably 0.01 to 10% by weight.</p><p>In the sixth embodiment of the present invention, as oil-soluble antioxidants included in the external skin treatment composition as a stabilizer, mention may be made of butyl hydroxytoluene (BHT), butyl hydroxyanisole (BHA), α,β,γ,δ-tocopherols, nordihydrogualaretin, propyl gallate, a fatty acid ester of vitamin C and sorbic acid.</p><p>An amount thereof to be formulated in accordance with the present invention is prefearbly 0.001% by weight or more, more preferably 0.01% by weight or more. In order to maintain the effects of the invention for a long time, the formulation amount is preferably 0.03% by weight. The upper limit of the formulation amount depends on the form of the external skin treatment composition and the formulation amount can be optionally selected.

The upper limit of the formulation amount cannot be particularly set. However, if an extremely large amount of the same is formulated, the effects of the present invention are not impaired, but crystals can be precipitated to impair the qualities of the external skin treatment composition. Thus the formulation amount is preferably 0.005 to 1% by weight.</p><p>As the benzophenone compound used in the present invention, mention may be made of 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-1), 2,2',4,4,-tetrahydroxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-2), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-3), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-4), sodium 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonate (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-5), 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone (hereinafre referred to as benzophenone-6), 2-hydroxy-5-chlorobenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-7), 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-8), disodium 2,2 -dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone-5,5'-sulfonate (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-9), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-4'-methylbenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-10) and 2-hydroxy-4-octyloxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-12).</p><p>The formulation amount thereof to the external skin treatment composition of the present invention is 0.001% by weight or more.

The upper limit of the formulation amount cannot particularly be set. However, if an extremely large amount of the same is formulated, the effects of the present invention are not impaired, but crystals can be precipitated to impair the qualities of the external skin treatment composition. Thus the formulation amount is preferably 10% by weight or less.</p><p>As the benzophenone compound used in the present invention, mention may be made of 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-1), 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-2), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-3), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-4), sodium 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonate (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-5), 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-6), 2-hydroxy-5-chlorobenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-7), 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-8), disodium 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone-5,5'-sulfonate (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-9), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-4'-methylbenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-10) and 2-hydroxy-4-octyloxybenzophenone (hereinafter referred to as benzophenone-12).</p><p>The formulation amount thereof to the external skin treatment composition of the present invention is 0.001% by weight or more.
