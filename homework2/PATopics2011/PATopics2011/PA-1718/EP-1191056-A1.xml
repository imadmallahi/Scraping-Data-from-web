reinforced with particulate silica-based reinforcement together with
tetrathiodipropionic acid as a non-silane containing coupling agent to aid in the
reinforcement of the rubber composition with a particulate silica-based material
and an article of manufacture, including a tire, having at least one component
comprised of such rubber composition.</p><heading><u style="single">Background for the Invention</u></heading><p num="0002">For various applications utilizing rubber compositions, carbon black
and/or synthetic amorphous silica-based materials are conventionally used as
particulate reinforcing fillers for the elastomer(s) of the rubber composition(s).</p><p num="0003">Often a coupling agent is used together with the silica in order to couple,
or otherwise enhance, its elastomer reinforcement effect for the elastomer(s)
and such use of a coupling agent is well known to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0004">Such coupling agents might also be sometimes referred to as being
adhesive agents insofar as use thereof to enhance reinforcement of various
elastomer compositions with various silica-based materials such as, for
example, aggregates of precipitated silica.</p><p num="0005">Historically, such coupling agents are conventionally silane-based
compounds which have one moiety (a silane-based moiety such as, for
example, an alkoxysilane moiety) which is reactive with hydroxyl groups (e.g.
silanol groups) on the surface of a synthetic amorphous silica and having
another moiety (e.g. a polysulfide bridge) which becomes interactive with a
conjugated diene-based elastomer.</p><p num="0006">For example, bis-(3-trialkoxysilylpropyl) polysulfides having an average
of from 2 to 4 connecting sulfur atoms in their polysulfidic bridge are often used
as a coupling agent (or adhesive) to enhance coupling of synthetic amorphous
silicas, such as aggregates of precipitated silica, to various conjugated diene-based
elastomers. Use of such coupling agents is well known to those having
skill in such art.</p><p num="0007">However, use of silane-containing coupling agents, or adhesives, which
rely upon a reaction between the silane and hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol
groups) on the surface of a synthetic amorphous silica typically releases an
alcohol as a by product of such reaction. For example, a reaction of a bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) 
tetrasulfide coupling agent with silanol groups on the
surface of a silica material releases ethanol as a byproduct.</p><p num="0008">For various purposes, it may be desired to reduce or substantially, or
even entirely, eliminate such alcohol evolution created by an in situ reaction of
said reactants, with an associated alcohol formation, within an elastomer host
during the mixing of a rubber composition which contains such reactants.</p><p num="0009">In the description of this invention, the term "phr" is used to designate
parts by weight of a material per 100 parts by weight of elastomer. In the
further description, the terms "rubber" and "elastomer" may be used
interchangeably unless otherwise mentioned. The terms "vulcanized" and
"cured" may be used interchangeably, as well as "unvulcanized" or "uncured",
unless otherwise indicated.</p><heading><u style="single">Summary and Practice of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0010">In accordance with one aspect of this invention, a rubber composition is
provided which comprises
<sl><li>(A) 100 parts by weight of at least one diene-based elastomer,</li><li>(B) 25 to 100, optionally 35 to 90, phr of particulate reinforcing filler

least one of carbon black and silica treated carbon black having domains of
silica on its surface; wherein said silica aggregates and said silica domains on
the surface of said treated carbon black contain hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol
groups) on their surface; and</li><li>(C) a coupling agent as tetrathiodipropionic acid;</li></sl>
wherein said tetrathiodipropionic acid is mixed with said elastomer(s), according
to one or more of the following:
<sl><li>(1) mixing said tetrathiodipropionic acid with said elastomer(s) and
said particulate reinforcement, preferably in an internal rubber mixer,</li><li>(2) mixing said tetrathiodipropionic acid with said elastomer(s) and
said particulate reinforcement, preferably in an internal rubber mixer, wherein

said particulate reinforcement, preferably in an internal rubber mixer, wherein
said tetrathiodipropionic acid has been pre-reacted with
<sl><li>(a) a synthetic precipitated silica or</li><li>(b) an aqueous dispersion of colloidal silica particles
from which a precipitated silica is recovered to form a silica composite thereof,</li></sl></li><li>(5) mixing said tetrathiodipropionic acid with said elastomer(s) and

with said elastomers with an alkylsilane of the general formula (I):
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">(I)   X<sub>n</sub>―Si―R<sub>4-n</sub></st32:che>
wherein X is a radical selected from alkoxy radicals having from 1 through 3
carbon atoms, preferably selected from methoxy and ethoxy radicals, and from
halogen radicals selected from at least one of chlorine and bromine radicals,
preferably a chlorine radical; R is an alkyl radical having from 1 to 18 carbon
atoms, preferably from 1 through 4 carbon atoms and more preferably selected
from methyl and ethyl groups; and n is an integer of 1 through 3,</li><li>(6) mixing said tetrathiodipropionic acid with said elastomer(s) and an

<sl><li>(a) a synthetic precipitated silica or</li><li>(b) an aqueous dispersion of colloidal silica particles

provided which contains at least one component comprised of the rubber
composition of this invention.</p><p num="0012">In additional accordance with this invention, a tire is provided which
contains at least one component comprised of the rubber composition of this
invention. </p><p num="0013">In further accordance with this invention, a tire is provided having a tread
comprised of the rubber composition of this invention.</p><p num="0014">A significant aspect of this invention for the use of tetrathiodipropionic
acid as a coupling agent is that the reaction, and therefore the coupling, of the
terminal hydroxyl functional group of tetrathiodipropionic acid with the hydroxyl
groups on the surface of the silica and/or surface of the silica of the silica
treated carbon black (e.g. silanol groups) results in a formation of water instead
of an alcohol.</p><p num="0015">In addition, it is contemplated that the non-silane coupler of this invention
can be used in combination with a reduced amount of an alkoxysilane
polysulfide coupling agent (e.g. a bis(3-ethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide or
tetrasulfide) to reduce an evolution of an alcohol byproduct during the reaction
thereof with hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol groups) on the surface of a silica in the
manufacture of rubber products.</p><p num="0016">The silica treated carbon black relates to carbon black which contains
domains of exposed silica on the surface of the carbon black. Such carbon
black may be prepared, for example, by reaction of an alkyl silane (e.g. an
alkoxy silane) with carbon black or by co-fuming carbon black and silica at an
elevated temperature. For example, see US-A- 5,679,728 and 6,028,137.</p><p num="0017">In one aspect of the practice of this invention, the silica, particularly
precipitated silica aggregates, may reacted with, particularly pre-reacted with,
the alkylsilane of formula (1), which might be considered herein as a
hydrophobating agent for the silica, to hydrophobate, particularly to pre-hydrophobate,
the silica. In one aspect, it is contemplated herein that the silica
may be pre-hydrophobated, for example, by treating silica in an aqueous
colloidal form thereof with said alkylsilane of formula (I).</p><p num="0018">The pre-hydrophobated precipitated silica aggregates might be
recovered, for example, from said treated colloidal silica, for example as a
treated silica hydrosol, with the aid of acid addition to the treated colloidal silica
(for example, sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid) followed by water washing and
drying the recovered hydrophobated silica as a hydrophobated silica gel or as a
hydrophobated precipitated silica. While this invention is not intended to be
directed to a specific preparation technique (preparation of silica hydrosols,
recovery of silica gels and precipitated silicas, etc.) of the pre-hydrophobated
precipitated silica itself, for education purposes in this regard, reference might
be made to the aforesaid Condensed Chemical Dictionary and US-A-5,094,829
as well as 5,708,069, 5,789,514 and 5,750,610 for a more detailed 
discussion.</p><p num="0019">Representative alkylsilanes of Formula (I) are, for example, trichloro
methyl silane, dichloro dimethyl silane, chloro trimethyl silane, trimethoxy methyl
silane, dimethoxy dimethyl silane, methoxy trimethyl silane, trimethoxy propyl
silane, trimethoxy octyl silane, trimethoxy hexadecyl silane, dimethoxy dipropyl
silane, triethoxy methyl silane, triethoxy propyl silane, triethoxy octyl silane, and
diethoxy dimethyl silane.</p><p num="0020">In practice, various diene-based elastomers may be used such as, for
example, homopolymers and copolymers of monomers selected from isoprene
and 1,3-butadiene and copolymers of at least one diene selected from isoprene
and 1,3-butadiene and a vinyl aromatic compound selected from styrene and
alphamethyl styrene, preferably styrene.</p><p num="0021">Representative of such conjugated diene-based elastomers are, for
example, cis 1,4-polyisoprene (natural and synthetic), cis 1,4-polybutadiene,
styrene/butadiene copolymers (aqueous emulsion polymerization prepared and
organic solvent solution polymerization prepared), medium vinyl polybutadiene
having a vinyl 1,2-content in a range of 15 to 90 percent, isoprene/butadiene
copolymers, styrene/ isoprene/butadiene terpolymers. Tin coupled elastomers
may also be used, such as, for example, tin coupled organic solution
polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene co-polymers and isoprene/butadiene
copolymers, styrene/isoprene copolymers, polybutadiene and
styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymers.</p><p num="0022">In the further practice of this invention, particulate reinforcement for the
rubber composition may be particulate synthetic amorphous silica, or a
combination of carbon black and amorphous silica (exclusive of silica treated
carbon black), usually of an amount in a range of 25 to 100 alternately 35 to 90,
phr. If a combination of such carbon black and silica is used, usually at least 5
phr of carbon black and at least 10 phr of silica are used. For example, a
weight ratio of silica to carbon black ranging from 1/5 to 5/1 might be used.</p><p num="0023">Commonly employed synthetic amorphous silica, or siliceous pigments,
used in rubber compounding applications can be used as the silica in this
invention, including precipitated siliceous pigments and fumed (pyrogenic) silica
wherein aggregates of precipitated silicas are usually preferred.</p><p num="0024">The precipitated silica aggregates preferably employed in this invention
are precipitated silicas such as, for example, those obtained by the acidification
of a soluble silicate, e.g., sodium silicate and may include co-precipitated silica 
and a minor amount of aluminum.</p><p num="0025">Such silicas might usually be characterized, for example, by having a
BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, preferably in the range of
40 to 600, and more usually in a range of 50 to 300 square meters per gram.
The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the <u style="single">Journal of the
American Chemical Society,</u> Volume 60, Page 304 (1930).</p><p num="0026">The silica may also be typically characterized by having a
dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of 50 to 400 cm<sup>3</sup>/100g, and
more usually 100 to 300 cm<sup>3</sup>/100g.</p><p num="0027">Various commercially available precipitated silicas may be considered for
use in this invention such as, only for example herein, and without limitation,
silicas from PPG Industries under the Hi-Sil trademark with designations Hi-Sil
210, Hi-Sil 243, etc; silicas from Rhodia as, for example, Zeosil 1165MP and
Zeosil 165GR, silicas from Degussa AG with, for example, designations VN2
and VN3, as well as other grades of silica, particularly precipitated silicas, which
can be used for elastomer reinforcement.</p><p num="0028">It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber
composition would be compounded by methods generally known in the rubber
compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent
rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example,
curing aids, such as sulfur, activators, retarders and accelerators, processing
additives, such as oils, resins including tackifying resins, silicas, and
plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and
antiozonants, peptizing agents and reinforcing materials such as, for example,
carbon black. As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the intended
use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the
additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional
amounts.</p><p num="0029">Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise 0.5 to 10 phr,
usually 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise 1 to 50 phr.
Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, napthenic, and/or
paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise 1 to 5 phr.
Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine
and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in <u style="single">The Vanderbilt Rubber
Handbook</u> (1978), Pages 344 through 346. Typical amounts of antiozonants
comprise 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include
stearic acid comprise 0.5 to 3 phr. Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise 1 to 
10 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise 1 to 5 phr. Often microcrystalline
waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers comprise 0.1 to 1 phr.</p><p num="0030">The vulcanization is conducted in the presence of a sulfur vulcanizing
agent. Examples of suitable sulfur vulcanizing agents include elemental sulfur
(free sulfur) or sulfur donating vulcanizing agents, for example, an amine
disulfide, polymeric polysulfide or sulfur olefin adducts. Preferably, the sulfur
vulcanizing agent is elemental sulfur. As known to those skilled in the art, sulfur
vulcanizing agents are used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 4 phr, or even, in
some circumstances, up to 8 phr.</p><p num="0031">Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for
vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one
embodiment, a single accelerator system may be used, i.e., primary
accelerator. Conventionally and preferably, a primary accelerator(s) is used in
total amounts ranging from 0.5 to 4, preferably 0.8 to 1.5, phr. In another
embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be
used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts (of 0.05 to
3 phr) in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate.
Combinations of these accelerators might be expected to produce a synergistic
effect on the final properties and are somewhat better than those produced by
use of either accelerator alone. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be
used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures but produce a
satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization
retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used
in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles,
thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the
primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the
secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram
compound.</p><p num="0032">The presence and relative amounts of the above additives are not
considered to be an aspect of the present invention, unless otherwise indicated
herein, which is more primarily directed to the utilization a non-silane containing
coupling agent, namely the tetrathiodipropionic acid, for enhancing
reinforcement of a conjugated diene-based elastomer with a particulate
synthetic silica material, or silica containing material for which such silica
contains hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol groups) on its surface.</p><p num="0033">The mixing of the rubber composition can be accomplished by methods
known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. For example, the 
ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely, at least one non-productive
stage followed by a productive mix stage. The final curatives are
typically mixed in the final stage which is conventionally called the "productive"
mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate
temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive
mix stage(s). The rubber, and fillers such as silica and silica treated
carbon black and adhesive agent, are mixed in one or more non-productive mix
stages. The terms "non-productive" and "productive" mix stages are well known
to those having skill in the rubber mixing art.</p><p num="0034">The following examples are presented to illustrate the invention and are
not intended to be limiting. The parts and percentages are by weight unless
otherwise designated.</p><heading>EXAMPLE I</heading><p num="0035">Rubber compositions are prepared which contained cis 1,4-polyisoprene
natural rubber and a solution polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene
copolymer (S-SBR) with reinforcement as carbon black and silica as filler by
blending the ingredients in an internal rubber mixer as outlined in Table 1 and
identified herein as Samples A, B and C.</p><p num="0036">Sample A represents a Control Sample which was prepared without a
coupling agent. Sample B also represents a Control Sample with a
conventional coupling agent to enhance the coupling of the silica to the
elastomer. Sample C contained the tetrathiodipropionic acid to illustrate a
practice of this invention as a non-silane coupling or adhesive agent.</p><p num="0037">The Sample compositions were prepared by blending the elastomer and
associated ingredients, without the sulfur curative and vulcanization accelerator,
and without a coupling agent in an internal rubber mixer, for 4 minutes to a
temperature of 160°C. (The first non-productive mixing step.) The resulting
elastomer compositions were then mixed in an internal rubber mixer for 2
minutes to a temperature of 160°C degrees during which, for Samples B and C,
the coupling agent was blended. (The second non-productive mixing step).
The resulting elastomer compositions were then mixed in an internal rubber
