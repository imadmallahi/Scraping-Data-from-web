acid and 3-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-2-{[4-(4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)benzoyl]amino}benzanilide
or a salt thereof is an
effective ingredient.</p></abstract> <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><heading>Technical Field:</heading><p num="0001">This invention relates to a novel diazepan
derivative or a salt thereof, which is useful as a
pharmaceutical particularly as an activated blood
coagulation factor X inhibitor and also to such a
pharmaceutical agent.</p><heading>Background Art:</heading><p num="0002">With the changes into European and American life
styles and the increase in aged population in recent years,
the number of patients with thromboembolic diseases
including myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis and
peripheral arterial thrombosis have been increasing year
by year and social importance of their treatment has been
increasing more and more. As well as the fibrinolysis
therapy and antiplatelet therapy, the anticoagulation
therapy takes a part of the medical therapy in treating
and preventing thrombosis (<i>Sogo Rinsho</i>, 41: 2141-2145,
1989). In particular, the safety which withstands long-term
administration and accurate and proper expression of
the anticoagulation activity are essential in the
prevention of thrombosis. Warfarin potassium is
frequently used in the world as the sole oral
anticoagulant but this drug is extremely difficult to use 
clinically because it is difficult to control the
anticoagulation capacity due to the characteristics based
on its action mechanism (<i>J. Clinical Pharmacology</i>, 32,
196-209, 1992 and <i>N. Eng. J. Med.,</i> 324(26), 1865-1875,
1991) whereby a great concern has been directed toward the
development of more useful and easily usable
anticoagulants.</p><p num="0003">Thrombin controls conversion of fibrinogen into
fibrin which is the final step of coagulation and is also
concerned deeply in the activation and aggregation of
platelets ("T-PA and Pro-UK" edited by S. Matsuo,
published by Gakusai Kikaku, pp. 5-40 "Blood Coagulation",
1986) and its inhibitor has been the center of
anticoagulant studies as a target of development of
pharmaceuticals. However, thrombin inhibitors which can
be administered orally have not been put into the market
until now because of their low bioavailability by oral
administration and problems from the viewpoint of safety
(<i>Biomed. Biochim. Acta,</i> 44, 1201-1210, 1985).</p> <p num="0004">Activated blood coagulation factor X is a key enzyme
which is located at the joining point of the extrinsic and
intrinsic coagulation cascade reactions and located
upstream to thrombin whereby there is a possibility that
inhibition of this factor is more efficient than the
thrombin inhibition and such an inhibitor can inhibit this
coagulation system in a specific manner <i>(THROMBOSIS
RESEARCH</i> (19), 339-349, 1980).</p> <p num="0005">As the compounds having an activated blood 
coagulation factor X inhibiting action, amidinonaphthyl
alkylbenzene derivatives or salts thereof have been known
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 208946/1993 ; <i>Thrombosis
Haemostasis,</i> 71(3), 314-319, 1994; and <i>Thrombosis
Haemostasis</i>, 72(3), 393-396, 1994).</p> <p num="0006">In WO 96/16940, it is mentioned that an
