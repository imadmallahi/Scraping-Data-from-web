The contents of the prior applications are hereby incorporated in their entirety.</p><p num="p0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0005">The p53 gene is mutated in over 50 different types of human cancers, including familial and spontaneous cancers, and is believed to be the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer (Zambetti and Levine, FASEB (1993) 7:855-865; Hollstein, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. (1994) 22:3551-3555). Greater than 90% of mutations in the p53 gene are missense mutations that alter a single amino acid that inactivates p53 function. Aberrant forms of human p53 are associated with poor prognosis, more aggressive tumors, metastasis, and short survival rates (Mitsudomi et al., Clin Cancer Res 2000 Oct; 6(10):4055-63; Koshland, Science (1993) 262:1953).</p><p num="p0006">The human p53 protein normally functions as a central integrator of signals including DNA damage, hypoxia, nucleotide deprivation, and oncogene activation (Prives, Cell (1998) 95:5-8). In response to these signals, p53 protem levels are greatly increased with the result that the accumulated p53 activates cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the nature and strength of these signals. Indeed, multiple lines of experimental evidence have pointed to a key role for p53 as a tumor suppressor (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331). For example, homozygous p53 "knockout" mice are developmentally normal but exhibit nearly 100% incidence of neoplasia in the first year of life (Donehower et al, Nature (1992) 356:215-221).</p><p num="p0007">The biochemical mechanisms and pathways through which p53 functions in normal and cancerous cells are not fully understood, but one clearly important aspect of p53 function is its activity as a gene-specific transcriptional activator. Among the genes with known p53-response elements are several with well-characterized roles in either regulation of the cell cycle or apoptosis, including GADD45, p21/Waf 1/Cipl, cyclin G, Bax, IGF- BP3, andMDM2 (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331).</p><p num="p0008">Translocated promoter region (TPR) is a nuclear pore protein that forms filaments extending from the intranuclear surface of the nuclear pore complex to the nucleolus, is involved in mRNA export, and its amino terminus is involved in activation of oncogenic

kinases (Dean, M. et al. (1987) Molec. Cell. Biol. 7: 921-924; Byrd DA et al. (1994) J Cell Biol 127:1515-26). The human TPR gene encodes two alternatively spliced transcripts (Mitchell, P. and Cooper, C. (1992) Oncogene 7(11): 2329-33). TPRs are expressed in a mammary gland/breast carcinoma cell line (Faleiro, L., and Lazebnik, Y. (2000) J Cell Biol 151: 951-60) and in stomach tumor (Soman, N. R., et al. (1991) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 88:4892-6).</p><p num="p0009">The ability to manipulate the genomes of model organisms such as Drosophila provides a powerful means to analyze biochemical processes that, due to significant evolutionary conservation, have direct relevance to more complex vertebrate organisms. Due to a high level of gene and pathway conservation, the strong similarity of cellular processes, and the functional conservation of genes between these model organisms and mammals, identification of the involvement of novel genes in particular pathways and their functions in such model organisms can directly contribute to the understanding of the correlative pathways and methods of modulating them in mammals (see, for example, Mechler BM et al., 1985 EMBO J 4: 1551-1557; Gateff E. 1982 Adv. Cancer Res. 37: 33- 74; Watson KL., et al, 1994 J Cell Sci. 18: 19-33; Miklos GL, and Rubin GM. 1996 Cell 86:521-529; Wassarman DA, et al., 1995 Curr Opin Gen Dev 5: 44-50; and Booth DR. 1999 Cancer Metastasis Rev. 18: 261-284). For example, a genetic screen can be carried out in an invertebrate model organism having underexpression (e.g. knockout) or overexpression of a gene (referred to as a "genetic entry point") that yields a visible phenotype. Additional genes are mutated in a random or targeted manner. When a gene mutation changes the original phenotype caused by the mutation in the genetic entry point, the gene is identified as a "modifier" involved in the same or overlapping pathway as the genetic entry point. When the genetic entry point is an ortholog of a human gene implicated in a disease pathway, such as p53, modifier genes can be identified that may be attractive candidate targets for novel therapeutics.</p><p num="p0010">All references cited herein, including sequence information in referenced Genbank identifier numbers and website references, are incorporated herein in their entireties.</p><p num="p0011">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0012">We have discovered genes that modify the p53 pathway in Drosophila, and identified their human orthologs, hereinafter referred to as TPR.

function. Preferred TPR-modulating agents specifically bind to TPR polypeptides and restore p53 function. Other preferred TPR-modulating agents are nucleic acid modulators such as antisense oligomers and RNAi that repress TPR gene expression or product activity by, for example, binding to and inhibiting the respective nucleic acid (i.e. DNA or mRNA).</p><p num="p0013">TPR-specific modulating agents may be evaluated by any convenient in vitro or in vivo assay for molecular interaction with a TPR polypeptide or nucleic acid. In one embodiment, candidate p53 modulating agents are tested with an assay system comprismg a TPR polypeptide or nucleic acid. Candidate agents that produce a change in the activity of the assay system relative to controls are identified as candidate p53 modulating agents. The assay system may be cell-based or cell-free. TPR-modulating agents include TPR related proteins (e.g. dominant negative mutants, and biotherapeutics); TPR-specific antibodies; TPR-specific antisense oligomers and other nucleic acid modulators; and chemical agents that specifically bind TPR or compete with TPR binding target. In one specific embodiment, a small molecule modulator is identified using a binding assay. In specific embodiments, the screening assay system is selected from an apoptosis assay, a cell proliferation assay, an angiogenesis assay, and a hypoxic induction assay.</p><p num="p0014">In another embodiment, candidate p53 pathway modulating agents are further tested using a second assay system that detects changes in the p53 pathway, such as angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation changes produced by the originally identified candidate agent or an agent derived from the original agent. The second assay system may use cultured cells or non-human animals. In specific embodiments, the secondary assay system uses non-human animals, including animals predetermined to have a disease or disorder implicating the p53 pathway, such as an angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation disorder (e.g. cancer).</p><p num="p0015">The invention further provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway in a mammalian cell by contacting the mammalian cell with an agent that specifically binds a TPR polypeptide or nucleic acid. The agent may be a small molecule modulator, a nucleic acid modulator, or an antibody and may be administered to a mammalian animal predetermined to have a pathology associated the p53 pathway.</p><p num="p0016">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0017">Genetic screens were designed to identify modifiers of the p53 pathway in Drosophila in which p53 was overexpressed in the wing (Ollmann M, et al., Cell 2000 101: 91-101). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
The BX34 gene was identified as a modifier of the p53 pathway. Accordingly, vertebrate orthologs of these modifiers, and preferably the human orthologs, translocated promoter region (TPR) genes (i.e., nucleic acids and polypeptides) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of pathologies associated with a defective p53 signaling pathway, such as cancer.</p><p num="p0018">In vitro and in vivo methods of assessing TPR function are provided herein. Modulation of the TPR or their respective binding partners is useful for understanding the association of the p53 pathway and its members in normal and disease conditions and for developing diagnostics and therapeutic modalities for p53 related pathologies. TPR- modulating agents that act by inhibiting or enhancing TPR expression, directly or indirectly, for example, by affecting a TPR function such as binding activity, can be identified using methods provided herein. TPR modulating agents are useful in diagnosis, therapy and pharmaceutical development.</p><p num="p0019">Nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention</p><p num="p0020">Sequences related to TPR nucleic acids and polypeptides that can be used in the invention are disclosed in Genbank (referenced by Genbank identifier (GI) number) as GI#s 633225 (SEQ ID NO:l), 4507658 (SEQ ID NO:2), 10434882 (SEQ ID NO:3), 37257 (SEQ JJD NO:4), and 1850341 (SEQ ID NO:5) for nucleic acid, and GI#s 633226 (SEQ ID NO:6) and 4507659 (SEQ ID NO:7) for polypeptides.</p><p num="p0021">TPRs are transcription factor proteins with bZD? transcription factor domains. The term "TPR polypeptide" refers to a full-length TPR protein or a functionally active fragment or derivative thereof. A "functionally active" TPR fragment or derivative exhibits one or more functional activities associated with a full-length, wild-type TPR protein, such as antigenic or immunogenic activity, binding activity, ability to bind natural cellular substrates, etc. The functional activity of TPR proteins, derivatives and fragments can be assayed by various methods known to one skilled in the art (Current Protocols in Protein Science (1998) Coligan et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Somerset, New Jersey) and as further discussed below. For purposes herein, functionally active fragments also include those fragments that comprise one or more structural domains of a TPR, such as a binding domain. Protein domains can be identified using the PFAM program (Bateman A., et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1999, 27:260-2; http://pfam.wusfl.edu). For example, the bzip domain of TPR from GI# 4507659 (SEQ ID NO:7) is located at approximately amino acid residues 1547 to 1601 (PFAM 00170). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
Likewise, the transposase domain of TPR from GI# 4507659 (SEQ ID NO:7) is located at approximately amino acid residues 782 to 859 (PFAM 01359). Methods for obtaining TPR polypeptides are also further described below. In some embodiments, preferred fragments are functionally active, domain-containing fragments comprising at least 25 contiguous amino acids, preferably at least 50, more preferably 75, and most preferably at least 100 contiguous amino acids of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 6 or 7 (a TPR). In further preferred embodiments, the fragment comprises the entire bZTP (functionally active) domain.</p><p num="p0022">The term "TPR nucleic acid" refers to a DNA or RNA molecule that encodes a TPR polypeptide. Preferably, the TPR polypeptide or nucleic acid or fragment thereof is from a human, but can also be an ortholog, or derivative thereof with at least 70% sequence identity, preferably at least 80%, more preferably 85%, still more preferably 90%, and most preferably at least 95% sequence identity with TPR. Normally, orthologs in different species retain the same function, due to presence of one or more protein motifs and/or 3- dimensional structures. Orthologs are generally identified by sequence homology analysis, such as BLAST analysis, usually using protein bait sequences. Sequences are assigned as a potential ortholog if the best hit sequence from the forward BLAST result retrieves the original query sequence in the reverse BLAST (Huynen MA and Bork P, Proc Natl Acad Sci (1998) 95:5849-5856; Huynen MA et al, Genome Research (2000) 10:1204-1210). Programs for multiple sequence alignment, such as CLUSTAL</p><p num="p0023">(Thompson JD et al, 1994, Nucleic Acids Res 22:4673-4680) may be used to highlight conserved regions and/or residues of orthologous proteins and to generate phylogenetic trees. In a phylogenetic tree representing multiple homologous sequences from diverse species (e.g., retrieved through BLAST analysis), orthologous sequences from two species generally appear closest on the tree with respect to all other sequences from these two species. Structural threading or other analysis of protein folding (e.g., using software by ProCeryon, Biosciences, Salzburg, Austria) may also identify potential orthologs. In evolution, when a gene duplication event follows speciation, a single gene in one species, such as Drosophila, may correspond to multiple genes (paralogs) in another, such as human. As used herein, the term "orthologs" encompasses paralogs. As used herein,</p><p num="p0024">"percent (%) sequence identity" with respect to a subject sequence, or a specified portion of a subject sequence, is defined as the percentage of nucleotides or amino acids in the candidate derivative sequence identical with the nucleotides or amino acids in the subject sequence (or specified portion thereof), after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps,

if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, as generated by the program WU-BLAST-2.0al9 (Altschul et al, J. Mol. Biol. (1997) 215:403-410; http://blast.wustl.edu/blast/README.html) with all the search parameters set to default values. The HSP S and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched. A % identity value is determined by the number of matching identical nucleotides or amino acids divided by the sequence length for which the percent identity is being reported. "Percent (%) amino acid sequence similarity" is determined by doing the same calculation as for determining % amino acid sequence identity, but including conservative amino acid substitutions in addition to identical amino acids in the computation.</p><p num="p0025">A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid having similar properties such that the folding or activity of the protein is not significantly affected. Aromatic amino acids that can be substituted for each other are phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine; interchangeable hydrophobic amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine; interchangeable polar amino acids are glutamine and asparagine; interchangeable basic amino acids are arginine, lysine and histidine; interchangeable acidic amino acids are aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and interchangeable small amino acids are alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine and glycine. Alternatively, an alignment for nucleic acid sequences is provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2:482-489; database: European Bioinfonnatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/MPsrch/; Smith and Waterman, 1981, J. of Molec.Biol., 147:195- 197; Nicholas et al., 1998, "A Tutorial on Searching Sequence Databases and Sequence Scoring Methods" (www.psc.edu) and references cited therein.; W.R. Pearson, 1991,</p><p num="p0026">Genomics 11:635-650). This algorithm can be applied to amino acid sequences by using the scoring matrix developed by Dayhoff (Dayhoff: Atlas of Protem Sequences and Structure, M. O. Dayhoff ed., 5 suppl. 3:353-358, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D.C., USA), and normalized by Gribskov (Gribskov 1986 Nucl. Acids Res. 14(6):6745-6763). The Smith-Waterman algorithm may be employed where default parameters are used for scoring (for example, gap open penalty of 12, gap extension penalty of two). From the data generated, the "Match" value reflects "sequence identity."

 Derivative nucleic acid molecules of the subject nucleic acid molecules include sequences that hybridize to the nucleic acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs:l, 2, 3, ,4 or 5. The stringency of hybridization can be controlled by temperature, ionic strength, pH, and the presence of denaturing agents such as formamide during hybridization and washing. Conditions routinely used are set out in readily available procedure texts (e.g., Current Protocol in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, Chap. 2.10, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Publishers (1994); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor (1989)).

Isolation, Production, Expression, and Mis-expression of TPR Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides</p><p num="p0029">TPR nucleic acids and polypeptides, useful for identifying and testing agents that modulate TPR function and for other applications related to the involvement of TPR in the p53 pathway. TPR nucleic acids and derivatives and orthologs thereof may be obtained using any available method. For instance, techniques for isolating cDNA or genomic DNA sequences of interest by screening DNA libraries or by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are well known in the art. In general, the particular use for the protein will dictate the particulars of expression, production, and purification methods. For instance, production of proteins for use in screening for modulating agents may require methods that preserve specific biological activities of these proteins, whereas production of proteins for antibody generation may require structural integrity of particular epitopes. Expression of proteins to be purified for screening or antibody production may require the addition of specific tags (e.g., generation of fusion proteins). Overexpression of a TPR protein for assays used to assess TPR function, such as involvement in cell cycle regulation or hypoxic response, may require expression in eukaryotic cell lines capable of these cellular activities. Techniques for the expression, production, and purification of proteins are well known in the art; any suitable means therefore may be used (e.g., Higgins SJ and Hames BD (eds.) Protein Expression: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press Inc., New York 1999; Stanbury PF et al., Principles of Fermentation Technology, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, Elsevier Science, New York, 1995; Doonan S (ed.) Protein Purification Protocols, Humana Press, New Jersey, 1996; Coligan JE et al, Current Protocols in Protein Science (eds.), 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). In particular embodiments, recombinant TPR is expressed in a cell line known to have defective p53 function (e.g. SAOS-2 osteoblasts, H1299 lung cancer cells, C33A and HT3 cervical cancer cells, HT-29 and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, among others, available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). The recombinant cells are used in cell-based screening assay systems of the invention, as described further below.</p><p num="p0030">The nucleotide sequence encoding a TPR polypeptide can be inserted into any appropriate expression vector. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals, including promoter/enhancer element, can derive from the native TPR gene and/or its flanking regions or can be heterologous. A variety of host-vector expression systems may be utilized, such as mammalian cell systems infected with virus (e.g. vaccinia virus, adenovirus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with virus (e.g. baculovirus); 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors, or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA. A host cell strain that modulates the expression of, modifies, and/or specifically processes the gene product may be used.</p><p num="p0031">To detect expression of the TPR gene product, the expression vector can comprise a promoter operably linked to a TPR gene nucleic acid, one or more origins of replication, and, one or more selectable markers (e.g. thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, etc.). Alternatively, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying for the expression of the TPR gene product based on the physical or functional properties of the TPR protein in in vitro assay systems (e.g. immunoassays). The TPR protein, fragment, or derivative may be optionally expressed as a fusion, or chimeric protein product (i.e. it is joined via a peptide bond to a heterologous protem sequence of a different protein), for example to facilitate purification or detection. A chimeric product can be made by ligating the appropriate nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired amino acid sequences to each other using standard methods and expressing the chimeric product. A chimeric product may also be made by protein synthetic techniques, e.g. by use of a peptide synthesizer (Hunkapiller et al., Nature (1984) 310:105-111).</p><p num="p0032">Once a recombinant cell that expresses the TPR gene sequence is identified, the gene product can be isolated and purified using standard methods (e.g. ion exchange, affinity, and gel exclusion chromatography; centrifugation; differential solubility; electrophoresis, cite purification reference). Alternatively, native TPR proteins can be purified from natural sources, by standard methods (e.g. immunoaffinity purification). Once a protein is obtained, it may be quantified and its activity measured by appropriate methods, such as immunoassay, bioassay, or other measurements of physical properties, such as crystallography. The methods of this invention may also use cells that have been engineered for altered expression (mis-expression) of TPR or other genes associated with the p53 pathway. As used herein, mis-expression encompasses ectopic expression, over-expression, under- expression, and non-expression (e.g. by gene knock-out or blocking expression that would otherwise normally occur).</p><p num="p0033">Genetically modified animals</p><p num="p0034">Animal models that have been genetically modified to alter TPR expression may be used in in vivo assays to test for activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent, or to further assess the role of TPR in a p53 pathway process such as apoptosis or cell proliferation.

Preferably, the altered TPR expression results in a detectable phenotype, such as decreased or increased levels of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, or apoptosis compared to control animals having normal TPR expression. The genetically modified animal may additionally have altered p53 expression (e.g. p53 knockout). Preferred genetically modified animals are mammals such as primates, rodents (preferably mice), cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs and cats. Preferred non-mammalian species include zebrafish, C. elegans, and Drosophila. Preferred genetically modified animals are transgenic animals having a heterologous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element in a portion of its cells, i.e. mosaic animals (see, for example, techniques described by Jakobovits, 1994, Curr. Biol. 4:761-763.) or stably integrated into its germ line DNA (i.e., in the genomic sequence of most or all of its cells). Heterologous nucleic acid is introduced into the germ line of such transgenic animals by genetic manipulation of, for example, embryos or embryonic stem cells of the host animal.</p><p num="p0035">Methods of making transgenic animals are well-known in the art (for transgenic mice see Brinster et al., Proc.

or insignificant. Knock-out animals are typically generated by homologous recombination with a vector comprising a transgene having at least a portion of the gene to be knocked out. Typically a deletion, addition or substitution has been introduced into the transgene to functionally disrupt it. The transgene can be a human gene (e.g., from a human genomic clone) but more preferably is an ortholog of the human gene derived from the transgenic host species. For example, a mouse TPR gene is used to construct a homologous recombination vector suitable for altering an endogenous TPR gene in the mouse genome. Detailed methodologies for homologous recombination in mice are available (see Capecchi, Science (1989) 244:1288-1292; Joyner et al, Nature (1989) 338:153-156). Procedures for the production of non-rodent transgenic mammals and other animals are also available (Houdebine and Chourrout, supra; Pursel et al., Science (1989) 244:1281-1288; Simms et al, Bio/Technology (1988) 6:179-183). In a preferred embodiment, knock-out animals, such as mice harboring a knockout of a specific gene, may be used to produce antibodies against the human counterpart of the gene that has been knocked out (Claesson MH et al, (1994) Scan J Immunol 40:257-264; Declerck PJ et al, (1995) J Biol Chem. 270:8397-400).</p><p num="p0038">In another embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-in" animal having an alteration in its genome that results in altered expression (e.g., increased (including ectopic) or decreased expression) of the TPR gene, e.g., by introduction of additional copies of TPR, or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for altered expression of an endogenous copy of the TPR gene. Such regulatory sequences include inducible, tissue-specific, and constitutive promoters and enhancer elements. The knock- in can be homozygous or heterozygous.</p><p num="p0039">Transgenic nonhuman animals can also be produced that contain selected systems allowing for regulated expression of the transgene. One example of such a system that may be produced is the cre/loxP recombinase system of bacteriophage PI (Lakso et al., PNAS (1992) 89:6232-6236; U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,317). If a cre/loxP recombinase system is used to regulate expression of the transgene, animals containing transgenes encoding both the Cre recombinase and a selected protein are required. Such animals can be provided through the construction of "double" transgenic animals, e.g., by mating two transgenic animals, one containing a transgene encoding a selected protein and the other containing a transgene encoding a recombinase. Another example of a recombinase system is the FLP recombinase system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (O'Gorman et al. (1991) Science 251:1351-1355; U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,182). In a preferred embodiment, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
both Cre-LoxP and Flp-Frt are used in the same system to regulate expression of the transgene, and for sequential deletion of vector sequences in the same cell (Sun X et al (2000) Nat Genet 25:83-6).</p><p num="p0040">The genetically modified animals can be used in genetic studies to further elucidate the p53 pathway, as animal models of disease and disorders implicating defective p53 function, and for in vivo testing of candidate therapeutic agents, such as those identified in screens described below. The candidate therapeutic agents are administered to a genetically modified animal having altered TPR function and phenotypic changes are compared with appropriate control animals such as genetically modified animals that receive placebo treatment, and/or animals with unaltered TPR expression that receive candidate therapeutic agent.</p><p num="p0041">In addition to the above-described genetically modified animals having altered TPR function, animal models having defective p53 function (and otherwise normal TPR function), can be used in the methods of the present invention. For example, a p53 knockout mouse can be used to assess, in vivo, the activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent identified in one of the in vitro assays described below. p53 knockout mice are described in the literature (Jacks et al., Nature 2001;410:1111-1116, 1043-1044; Donehower et al., supra). Preferably, the candidate p53 modulating agent when administered to a model system with cells defective in p53 function, produces a detectable phenotypic change in the model system indicating that the p53 function is restored, i.e., the cells exhibit normal cell cycle progression.</p><p num="p0042">Modulating Agents</p><p num="p0043">The invention provides methods to identify agents that interact with and/or modulate the function of TPR and/or the p53 pathway. Such agents are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications associated with the p53 pathway, as well as in further analysis of the TPR protein and its contribution to the p53 pathway. Accordingly, the invention also provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway comprising the step of specifically modulating TPR activity by administering a TPR-interacting or - modulating agent.</p><p num="p0044">In a preferred embodiment, TPR-modulating agents inhibit or enhance TPR activity or otherwise affect normal TPR function, including transcription, protem expression, protein localization, and cellular or extra-cellular activity.

The phrases "specific modulating agent", "specifically modulates", etc., are used herein to refer to modulating agents that directly bind to the TPR polypeptide or nucleic acid, and preferably inhibit, enhance, or otherwise alter, the function of the TPR. The term also encompasses modulating agents that alter the interaction of the TPR with a binding partner or s.ubstrate (e.g. by binding to a binding partner of a TPR, or to a protein/binding partner complex, and inhibiting function).</p><p num="p0045">Preferred TPR-modulating agents include small molecule compounds; TPR-interacting proteins, including antibodies and other biotherapeutics; and nucleic acid modulators such as antisense and RNA inhibitors. The modulating agents may be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions, for example, as compositions that may comprise other active ingredients, as in combination therapy, and/or suitable carriers or excipients. Techniques for formulation and administration of the compounds may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 19<sup>th</sup> edition.</p><p num="p0046">Small molecule modulators</p><p num="p0047">Small molecules, are often preferred to modulate function of proteins with enzymatic function, and/or containing protein interaction domains. Chemical agents, referred to in the art as "small molecule" compounds are typically organic, non-peptide molecules, having a molecular weight less than 10,000, preferably less than 5,000, more preferably less than 1,000, and most preferably less than 500. This class of modulators includes chemically synthesized molecules, for instance, compounds from combinatorial chemical libraries. Synthetic compounds may be rationally designed or identified based on known or inferred properties of the TPR protem or may be identified by screening compound libraries. Alternative appropriate modulators of this class are natural products, particularly secondary metabolites from organisms such as plants or fungi, which can also be identified by screening compound libraries for TPR-modulating activity. Methods for generating and obtaining compounds are well known in the art (Schreiber SL, Science (2000) 151: 1964-1969; Radmann J and Gunther J, Science (2000) 151:1947-1948). Small molecule modulators identified from screening assays, as described below, can be used as lead compounds from which candidate clinical compounds may be designed, optimized, and synthesized. Such clinical compounds may have utility in treating pathologies associated with the p53 pathway. The activity of candidate small molecule modulating agents may be improved several-fold through iterative secondary functional validation, as further described below, structure determination, and candidate modulator

In a preferred embodiment, TPR-interacting proteins affect normal TPR function, including transcription, protein expression, protein localization, and cellular or extra-cellular activity. In another embodiment, TPR- interacting proteins are useful in detecting and providing information about the function of TPR proteins, as is relevant to p53 related disorders, such as cancer (e.g., for diagnostic means). An TPR-interacting protein may be endogenous, i.e. one that naturally interacts genetically or biochemically with a TPR, such as a member of the TPR pathway that modulates TPR expression, localization, and/or activity. TPR-modulators include dominant negative forms of TPR-interacting proteins and of TPR proteins themselves. Yeast two-hybrid and variant screens offer preferred methods for identifying endogenous TPR-interacting proteins (Finley, R. L. et al.

The antibodies have therapeutic and diagnostic utilities, and can be used in screening assays to identify TPR modulators. The antibodies can also be used in dissecting the portions of the TPR pathway responsible for various cellular responses and in the general processing and maturation of the TPR.</p><p num="p0053">Antibodies that specifically bind TPR polypeptides can be generated using known methods. Preferably the antibody is specific to a mammalian ortholog of TPR polypeptide, and more preferably, to human TPR. Antibodies may be polyclonal, monoclonal (mAbs), humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab').sub.2 fragments, fragments produced by a FAb expression library, anti- idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. Epitopes of TPR which are particularly antigenic can be selected, for example, by routine screening of TPR polypeptides for antigenicity or by applying a theoretical method for selecting antigenic regions of a protein (Hopp and Wood (1981), Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-28; Hopp and Wood, (1983) Mol. Immunol. 20:483-89; Sutcliffe et al., (1983) Science 219:660-66) to the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:6 or 7. Monoclonal antibodies with affinities of 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>"1</sup> preferably 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>"1</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, or stronger can be made by standard procedures as described (Harlow and Lane, supra; Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice (2d ed) Academic Press, New York; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,381,292; 4,451,570; and 4,618,577). Antibodies may be generated against crude cell extracts of TPR or substantially purified fragments thereof. If TPR fragments are used, they preferably comprise at least 10, and more preferably, at least 20 contiguous amino acids of a TPR protein. In a particular embodiment, TPR-specific antigens and/or immunogens are coupled to carrier proteins that stimulate the immune response. For example, the subject polypeptides are covalently coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier, and the conjugate is emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, which enhances the immune response. An appropriate immune system such as a laboratory rabbit or mouse is immunized according to conventional protocols. The presence of TPR-specific antibodies is assayed by an appropriate assay such as a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using immobilized corresponding TPR polypeptides. Other assays, such as radioimmunoassays or fluorescent assays might also be used.

 Chimeric antibodies specific to TPR polypeptides can be made that contain different portions from different animal species. For instance, a human immunoglobulin constant region may be linked to a variable region of a murine mAb, such that the antibody derives its biological activity from the human antibody, and its binding specificity from the murine fragment. Chimeric antibodies are produced by splicing together genes that encode the appropriate regions from each species (Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.</p><p num="p0054">(1984) 81:6851-6855; Neuberger et al, Nature (1984) 312:604-608; Takeda et al., Nature</p><p num="p0055">(1985) 31:452-454). Humanized antibodies, which are a form of chimeric antibodies, can be generated by grafting complementary-determining regions (CDRs) (Carlos, T. M., J. M. Harlan. 1994. Blood 84:2068-2101) of mouse antibodies into a background of human framework regions and constant regions by recombinant DNA technology (Riechmann LM, et al., 1988 Nature 323: 323-327). Humanized antibodies contain -10% murine sequences and ~90% human sequences, and thus further reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, while retaining the antibody specificities (Co MS, and Queen C. 1991 Nature 351: 501-501; Morrison SL. 1992 Ann.

As used herein the term "cell-based" refers to assays using live cells, dead cells, or a particular cellular fraction, such as a membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondrial fraction. The term "cell free" encompasses assays using substantially purified protein (either endogenous or recombinantly produced), partially purified or crude cellular extracts. Screening assays may detect a variety of molecular events, including protein-DNA interactions, protein-protein interactions (e.g., receptor-ligand binding), transcriptional activity (e.g., using a reporter gene), enzymatic activity (e.g., via a property of the substrate), activity of second messengers, immunogenicty and changes in cellular morphology or other cellular characteristics. Appropriate screening assays may use a wide range of detection methods including fluorescent, radioactive, colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and amperometric methods, to provide a read-out for the particular molecular event detected. Cell-based screening assays usually require systems for recombinant expression of</p><p num="p0072">TPR and any auxiliary proteins demanded by the particular assay. Appropriate methods for generating recombinant proteins produce sufficient quantities of proteins that retain their relevant biological activities and are of sufficient purity to optimize activity and assure assay reproducibility. Yeast two-hybrid and variant screens, and mass spectrometry provide preferred methods for determining protein-protein interactions and elucidation of protein complexes. In certain applications, when TPR-interacting proteins are used in screens to identify small molecule modulators, the binding specificity of the interacting protein to the TPR protem may be assayed by various known methods such as substrate processing (e.g. ability of the candidate TPR-specific binding agents to function as negative effectors in TPR-expressing cells), binding equilibrium constants (usually at least about 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, preferably at least about 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>1</sup>, more preferably at least about 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>1</sup>), and immunogenicity (e.g. ability to elicit TPR specific antibody in a heterologous host such as a mouse, rat, goat or rabbit). For enzymes and receptors, binding may be assayed by, respectively, substrate and ligand processing. The screening assay may measure a candidate agent' s ability to specifically bind to or modulate activity of a TPR polypeptide, a fusion protein thereof, or to cells or membranes bearing the polypeptide or fusion protein. The TPR polypeptide can be full length or a fragment thereof that retains functional TPR activity.

Preferably, the modulating agent produces a detectable phenotypic change in the cell indicating that the p53 function is restored, i.e., for example, the cell undergoes normal proliferation or progression through the cell cycle.</p><p num="p0097">The discovery that TPR is implicated in p53 pathway provides for a variety of methods that can be employed for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of diseases and disorders involving defects in the p53 pathway and for the identification of subjects having a predisposition to such diseases and disorders.</p><p num="p0098">Various expression analysis methods can be used to diagnose whether TPR expression occurs in a particular sample, including Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR, and microarray analysis, (e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994) Ausubel FM et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chapter 4; Freeman WM et al, Biotechniques (1999) 26:112-125; Kallioniemi OP, Ann Med 2001, 33:142-147; Blohm and Guiseppi-Elie, Curr Opin Biotechnol 2001, 12:41-47). Tissues having a disease or disorder implicating defective p53 signaling that express a TPR, are identified as amenable to treatment with a TPR modulating agent. In a preferred application, the p53 defective tissue overexpresses a TPR relative to normal tissue. For example, a Northern blot analysis of mRNA from tumor and normal cell lines, or from tumor and matching normal tissue samples from the same patient, using full or partial TPR cDNA sequences as probes, can determine whether particular tumors express or overexpress TPR. Alternatively, the TaqMan® is used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of TPR expression in cell lines, normal tissues and tumor samples (PE Applied Biosystems).</p><p num="p0099">Various other diagnostic methods may be performed, for example, utilizing reagents such as the TPR oligonucleotides, and antibodies directed against a TPR, as described

Drosophila p53 screen</p><p num="p0104">The Drosophila p53 gene was overexpressed specifically in the wing using the vestigial margin quadrant enhancer. Increasing quantities of Drosophila p53 (titrated using different strength transgenic inserts in 1 or 2 copies) caused deterioration of normal wing morphology from mild to strong, with phenotypes including disruption of pattern and polarity of wing hairs, shortening and thickening of wing veins, progressive crumpling of the wing and appearance of dark "death" inclusions in wing blade. In a screen designed to identify enhancers and suppressors of Drosophila p53, homozygous females carrying two copies of p53 were crossed to 5663 males carrying random insertions of a piggyBac transposon (Eraser M et al, Virology (1985) 145:356-361). Progeny containing insertions were compared to non-insertion-bearing sibling progeny for enhancement or suppression of the p53 phenotypes. Sequence information surrounding the piggyBac insertion site was used to identify the modifier genes. Modifiers of the wing phenotype were identified as members of the p53 pathway. BX34 was a suppressor of the wing phenotype. Human orthologs of the modifiers are referred to herein as TPR.</p><p num="p0105">BLAST analysis (Altschul et al., supra) was employed to identify Targets from Drosophila modifiers. For example, representative sequence from TPR, GI#4507659 (SEQ ID NO:7), shares 23% amino acid identity with the Drosophila. X34.

A gene is considered overexpressed in a tumor when the level of expression of the gene is 2 fold or higher in the tumor compared with its matched normal sample. In cases where normal tissue is not available, a universal pool of cDNA samples is used instead. In these cases, a gene is considered overexpressed in a tumor sample when the difference of expression levels between a tumor sample and the average of all normal samples from the same tissue type is greater than 2 times the standard deviation of all normal samples (i.e., Tumor - average(all normal samples) &gt; 2 x STDEV(all normal samples) ).</p><p num="p0114">A modulator identified by an assay described herein can be further validated for therapeutic effect by administration to a tumor in which the gene is overexpressed. A decrease in tumor growth confirms therapeutic utility of the modulator. Prior to treating a patient with the modulator, the likelihood that the patient will respond to treatment can be diagnosed by obtaining a tumor sample from the patient, and assaying for expression of the gene targeted by the modulator. The expression data for the gene(s) can also be used as a diagnostic marker for disease progression. The assay can be performed by expression analysis as described above, by antibody directed to the gene target, or by any other available detection method.
