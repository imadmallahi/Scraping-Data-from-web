relates to a ceramic article calcined at elevated temperatures
and endowed with acid points, a carrier for use in a catalyst,

at 1,000° - 2,000°C, a carrier for use in a catalyst, methods
for the production thereof, and method for producing ethylene

silicon, titanium, etc. as basic materials generally possess
exceptionally excellent thermal, mechanical, electrical, and
chemical properties and find utility in applications too many
to enumerate. Those of the ceramic articles which excel in
thermal and mechanical strength are extensively utilized in
the field of chemical industry as a carrier for a catalyst
and as a refining material and in the field of bioceramics 
as artificial bones and artificial teeth which are required
to possess affinity for living organism. Those of the ceramic
articles which possess chemical properties are used for
analysis utilizing the adsorbing desorbing property of a
chemical substance and particularly those of the ceramic
articles which possess acid points are utilized by themselves
as a catalyst for the oxidation of olefins and the
dehydrogenation of hydrated compounds.</p><p num="0003">JP-A-54-32,408, for example, discloses a non-acidic
filler containing alumina, silica, and titania in a total
amount of not less than 99 % by weight, containing metals
of the groups Va, VIa, VIIa, VIII, Ib, and IIb in the Periodic
Table of the Elements in a total amount of less than 0.1 %
by weight as reduced to metal oxides, and assuming no acidic
color in methyl red having a pKa of +4.8.</p><p num="0004">Further, JP-A-55-145,677 discloses a method for the
production of ethylene oxide characterized by using a silver
catalyst formed by using the non- acidic filler mentioned
above as a catalyst carrier and depositing thereon silver
and, when necessary, further an alkali metal component or
an alkaline earth metal component. US-A-4,812,437 discloses
a carrier composed mainly of α-alumina and having a specific
surface area, water absorption ratio, average pore diameter,
silica content and sodium content and assuming acidic color
in an indicator having pKa of +4.8.</p><p num="0005">JP-A-62-4,444 discloses that a carrier having small
amount of impurities is obtained by mixing an aluminium
compound with a salt of a metal of the group IA in the Periodic
Table of the Elements and calcining it, and the catalyst using
the carrier is excellent in stability. JP-A-4-363,139
discloses a carrier which contains an element of 4-6 Cycles
of the groups IIIa-VIIa and IIIb-Vb in the Periodic Table 
of the Elements in α-alumina and the catalyst using such
carrier gives high selectivity and long life. Further,
US-A-5,100,859 discloses a carrier comprising a high purity
α-alumina, an alkali earth metal oxide, a silicon oxide and
zirconium oxide, and the catalyst using such catalyst gives
a high initial selectivity and long life.</p><p num="0006">on the other hand, a carrier for a catalyst provided
on the surface of α-alumina with a coating layer of amorphous
silica and used for the production of ethylene oxide
(US-A-5,077,256) and a carrier for a catalyst provided on
the surface of α-alumina with a coating layer of amorphous
silica-alumina and used for the production of ethylene oxide
(US-A-5,395,812) have been known to the art. These patent
publications, however, neither suggest anything about a
ceramic article containing aluminum, silicon, and titanium
and manifesting acidity nor propose anything about a method
for the production of the ceramic article.</p><p num="0007">Generally, ceramic articles possessing acid points are
used as a dynamic blade and static blade of a gas turbine
and a combustion chamber of a reciproengine as a construction
material, for spraying on a turbine blade or a corn as a thermal
isulation material and for a thermal absorption material
utilizing the acidity thereof, but as a chemical use there
are used as catalysts or carriers for use in catalysts which
are useful for various oxidation reactions, reduction
reactions, addition reactions, and decomposition reactions.
They are required to possess high thermal stability in any
of these applications and they derive huge economic effects
from the high thermal stability. It is predicted that a
high-temperature heat treatment will suffice to impart high
thermal stability and mechanical strength to such carriers.
It is also the fact that the heat treatment performed at a 
high temperature deprives the such carriers of acid points.</p><p num="0008">An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide
a novel ceramic article, a carrier for a catalyst, methods
for the production thereof, a catalyst for producing ethylene
oxide using the carrier, and method for producing ethylene
oxide.</p><p num="0009">Another object of this invention is to provide a ceramic
article calcined at a high temperature and endowed with high
thermal stability and acid points, a carrier for a catalyst,
method for the production thereof, a catalyst for producing
ethylene oxide using the carrier, and method for producing
ethylene oxide.</p><p num="0010">Still another object of this invention is to provide
a catalyst for producing ethylene oxide excellent in a catalyst
performance, i.e., activity, selectivity and life, and a
method for producing ethylene oxide using such catalyst.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0011">These objects are accomplished by the following items

possesses high thermal stability and strong acid points, the
shaped article thereof is useful as a catalyst or a carrier
for a catalyst as in oxidation reactions, reduction reactions,
addition reactions, and decomposition reactions and excellent
in service life and performance in high-temperature reactions
as well. Further, the catalyst for producing ethylene oxide
obtained by using the carrier in accordance with the present
invention is excellent in catalyst performance, especially
in selectivity.</p><heading>EXPLANATION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p num="0013">The ceramic article according to this invention is
obtained, as described above, by calcining a mixture
containing an aluminum compound, a silicon compound, and a
titanium compound at a temperature in the range of 1,000° -
2,000°C.</p><p num="0014">As typical examples of the aluminum compound to be used
in this invention, α-alumina, β-alumina, and γ-alumina may
be cited. Among other aluminum compounds cited above, α
-alumina proves particularly advantageous. The α-alumina 
itself does not need to be particularly restricted. It may
be any of such compounds as are generally used as α-alumina.
It is particularly preferred to have an alkali metal content
in the range of 1 - 70 m.mols, especially in the range of
2 - 30 m.mols, per kg thereof (expressed in this invention
as 1 - 70 m.mols/kg (α-alumina powder). When the finished
product suffers alumina to be present therein in an amount
of not less than 99.5 % by weight, it manifest acid points
with difficulty. Properly, the aluminum content in the
finished product is in the range of 70.0 - 99.5 % by weight,
preferably 80.0 - 99.0 % by weight, and more preferably in
the range of 90.0 - 98.5 % by weight.</p><p num="0015">To be used effectively in this invention, the α-alumina
possesses an alumina crystal diameter (average primary
particle diameter) in the range of 0.1 - 5 µm, preferably
0.5 - 4 µm, a particle diameter (average secondary particle
diameter) in the range of 30 - 100 µm, preferably 50 - 80
µm, further a BET specific surface area in the range of 0.1
- 4 m<sup>2</sup>/g, preferably 0.5- 3.0 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and moreover a coefficient
of linear contraction by two hours' calcination at 1,700°C
in the range of 12-20%. The expression "coefficient of linear
contraction by two hours' calcination at 1,700°C" as used
herein means the coefficient of linear contraction which is
obtained when a sample resulting from pulverizing α-alumina
to the size of α-crystals (primary particles), shaping the
sample under a pressure of 1 ton/cm<sup>2</sup>, and calcining the shaped
article at 1,700°C for two hours.</p><p num="0016">The ceramic article of this invention contains aluminum,
silicon and titanium in a total amount of at least 99 % by
weight as reduced to the oxides (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + SiO<sub>2</sub> + TiO<sub>2</sub>), preferably
at least 99.5 % by weight. It is obtained, for example, by
mixing α-alumina having the aforementioned low alkali metal 
content with a titanium compound and a silicon compound
together with an organic binding agent and a pore forming
agent which are normally used and calcining the resultant
mixture at a temperature in the range of 1,000° - 2,000°C.
This calcination operation is believed to form an amorphous
silica-titania coating layer on the outer surface of α-alumina
and on the inner surface of pores thereof.</p><p num="0017">One of the characteristics of this invention resides
in the formation of such an amorphous silica-titania coating
layer on the surface of the α-alumina and the consequent
manifestation of strong acid points apparently originating
in the coating layer. The acid strength can be readily
determined by a method which is described from page 161 onward
in "Acid-Base Catalysts" written jointly by Kozo Tanabe and
Tsuneichi Takeshita and published by Sangyo Tosho K.K. on
April 26, 1966. The ceramic article of this invention contains
aluminum, silicon, and titanium, has a total content of alumina
(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>) of at least 99 %
by weight, and assumes a color in methyl red as an indicator
of pKa + 4.8. Further, by controlling the composition and
the conditions of preparation of the ceramic article, it is
made possible to manufacture an alumina-silica-titania type
ceramic article which assumes a color in phenyl azo
naphthylamine, an indicator of pKa + 4.0, p-dimethyl

toluene, an indicator of pKa + 2.0, or even dicinnamal acetone,
an indicator of pKa - 3.0. This alumina-silica-titania type
ceramic article is expected to find utility in various
applications, depending on the acid strength and the amount
of acid. Particularly it is possible to prepare a carrier
which has strong acid points and assumes a color at pKa +
2.0 or - 3.0 proves and the carrier having these properties 
is suitable for a catalyst intended for the production of
ethylene oxide.</p><p num="0018">As the titanium compound mentioned above, any of the
titanium compounds can be used so long as it is capable of
forming an amorphous silica-titania layer by being calcined
together with a silicon compound which will be described more
specifically below. As typical examples of the titanium
compound, titanium hydrate and titanium oxides (anatase,
rutile, and amorphous form) may be cited. These titanium
compounds may be used either singly or in the form of two
or more members. They may be used in the form of synthesized
products or natural produces. The titanium compound does not
need to be particularly discriminated on account of the state
of aggregate. It may be incorporated in the mixture in any
arbitrary state such as, for example, powder, sol, or aqueous
solution. When the titanium compound is in the state of powder,
it properly has a particle diameter in the range of 1 - 300
nm, preferably in the range of 1 - 20 nm. Among other titanium
compounds, colloidal titania having a particle diameter in
the range of 1 - 300 nm, preferably 1 - 20 nm, is used particularly
advantageously. From the viewpoint of the ease of dispersion,
this colloidal titania is preferred to be used in the form
of titania sol. This titania sol can be obtained, for example,
by a method which comprises hydrolyzing titanium salt or a
method which comprises neutralizing an aqueous titanium salt
solution with an alkali thereby forming a gel provisionally
and then peptizing the gel.</p><p num="0019">The silicon compound mentioned above to be effectively
used herein is only required to be capable of forming an
amorphous silica-titania by being calcined tegether with an
aluminum compound and a titanium compound. As typical
examples of the silicon compound, silica, feldspar, clay, 
silicon nitride, silicon carbide, silane, and silicates may
be cited. Besides, such aluminosilicates as silica-alumina
and mullite are also usable. These silicon compounds may
be used either singly or in the form of two or more members.
They may be used in the form of synthesized products or natural
produces. The silicon compound does not need to be
particularly discriminated on account of the state of

compounds, colloidal silica having a particle diameter in
the range of 1 - 300 nm, preferably 1 - 20 nm, is used particularly
advantageously. Due to high dispersibility, this colloidal
silica is preferred to be used in the form of an aqueous solution.
This colloidal silica can be obtained, for example, by a method
which comprises neutralizing an aqueous sodium silicate
solution with an acid thereby forming a gel provisionally
and then peptizing the gel or a method which comprises depriving
an aqueous sodium silicate solution of sodium by means of
ion exchange.</p><p num="0020">As the organic binding agent mentioned above, any of
organic binding agents which are generally used in the
preparation of any ordinary ceramic article, especially
carrier can be used. As typical examples of the organic
binding agent, gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxyethyl
cellulose, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and
corn starch may be cited. Among other organic binding agents
mentioned above, methyl cellulose and corn starch can be used
particularly advantageously in respect that they produce
ashes only in a small amount after the step of calcination. </p><p num="0021">The silicon content in the novel ceramic article or

of the fluorescent X-ray diffraction analysis of the ceramic

and titanium compound to be used in the preparation of the
novel ceramic article of this invention may be properly decided
so that the contents of aluminum, silicon, and titanium in
the produced ceramic article may fall in the respective ranges
specified above. Properly, the Ti/Si ratio is in the range
of 0.005 - 20, preferably 0.5 - 10, and more preferably 3

not need to be particularly restricted but may be properly
selected to suit the purpose of use optimally.</p><p num="0026">The method for preparing the novel ceramic article of
this invention does not need to be particularly discriminated.
For example, the preparation may be attained by mixing an
aluminum compound, a silicon compound, a titanium compound,
and an organic binding agent, molding the resultant mixture, 
and then calcining the molded mixture at a temperature in
the range of 1,000° - 2,000°C. To be specific, the method
comprises adding a silicon compound, a titanium compound,
and an organic binding agent to α-alumina, optionally further
adding water thereto, and thoroughly mixing them by the use
of a mixing device such as a kneader, then extrusion molding
the resultant mixture, granulating the molded mixture, drying
the granules, and calcining the dry granules at a temperature
in the range of 1,000° - 2,000°C, preferably 1,200° - 1,700°C,
and more preferably 1,300° - 1,600°C. Though the extrusion
molding may be effected in a dry form or a wet form, it is
generally carried out in a wet form. The drying operation
mentioned above is generally carried out at a temperature
in the range of 80° - 900°c. It may be omitted as occasion
demands.</p><p num="0027">The organic binding agent may be used in conjunction
with a pore forming agent such as, for example, a powder
obtained by pulverizing shells and seeds of peaches, apricots,
and walnuts to a uniform particle diameter or a substance
having a uniform particle diameter and possessing the ability
to disappear when calcined.</p><p num="0028">The ceramic article of this invention on account of the
chemical property of its own is advantageously used as a
catalyst or a carrier for a catalyst. When it is used as a
catalyst or a carrier for a catalyst, it does not need to
be particularly limited in shape. Generally, it is used in
such a granular form as spheres, pellets, and rings. As
regards the size thereof, it has an average equivalent diameter
generally in the range of 3 - 20 mm, preferably 5 - 10 mm.</p><p num="0029">Specifically, from the ceramic article mentioned above,
a carrier for a catalyst is obtained by molding the ceramic
article in the shape mentioned above prior to the step of 
calcination and calcining the produced formed article under
the conditions mentioned above. The carrier thus obtained
is advantageously used particularly for a silver catalyst
having deposited thereon silver and an alkali metal oxide
and used for the production of ethylene oxide by the oxidation
of ethylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas.</p><p num="0030">The specific surface area of the carrier contemplated
by this invention is generally in the range of 0.03 - 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g,
preferably 0.1 - 5 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and more preferably 0.3 - 2 m<sup>2</sup>/g.
If the specific surface area is unduly small, the shortage
will be at a disadvantage in suffering the sinter to proceed
excessively and preventing impartation of a satisfactory
coefficient of water absorption to the carrier and rendering
deposition of a catalyst component on the carrier difficult.
Conversely, if the specific surface area is unduly large,
the excess will be at a disadvantage in decreasing the pore
diameter and accelerating the sequential oxidation of the
produced ethylene oxide. The coefficient of water absorption
is generally in the range of 10 - 70%, preferably 20 - 60%,
and more preferably 30 - 50%. If the coefficient of water
absorption is unduly low, the shortage will be at a disadvantage
in rendering deposition of a catalyst component difficult.
Conversely, if it is unduly high, the excess will be at a
disadvantage in disabling acquisition of a satisfactory
crushing strength. The average pore diameter is generally
in the range of 0.1 - 5 µm, preferably 0.2 - 3 µm, and more
preferably 0.3 - 0.9 µm. If the average pore diameter is
unduly large, the excess will be at a disadvantage in degrading
the activity. Conversely, it is unduly small, the shortage
will be at a disadvantage in inducing stagnation of gas and
promoting the sequential oxidation of the produced ethylene
oxide. The porosity is generally in the range of 40 - 80% 
and preferably 50 - 70%. If the porosity is unduly low, the
shortage will be at a disadvantage in enlarging the specific
gravity of the carrier excessively. If it is unduly high,
the excess will be at a disadvantage in preventing the carrier
from acquiring satisfactory crushing strength.</p><p num="0031">The catalyst for producing ethylene oxide in accordance

inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen gas at a temperature
of 80° - 120°C. Calcination is preferably carried out in air,
oxygen gas or an inert gas atmosphere at a temperature of
150° - 800°C. Further, the calcinations may be carried out
in one step or two steps or more. Among them, it is preferable
