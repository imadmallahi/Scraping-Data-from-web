The present invention further relates to methods of preparing and using such modified particles.</p><p>The role of carbon black as a thermal stabilizer in polymeric systems is discussed by W. L. Hawkins, R. H. Hansen, W. Matreyek, F. H. Winslow; J. Applied Polymer Science, vol. 1, pages 37-42, 1959; J. T. Cruver, K. W. Rollmann: J. Applied Polymer Science, vol. 8, pages 1169-83, 1964, and by G. Ivan, M. Giurgina: Revue Roumaine de Chemie, vol. 29, number 8, pages 639-646, 1984. In each discussion the mechanism is through phenolic and quinone oxygen groups on the carbon black surface behaving either as radical traps or peroxide decomposers. One skilled in the art, however, would consider these sites unavailable as initiating sites for polymerization processes.</p><p>Belmont et al. (J. A. Belmont, J. M. Funt: International Rubber Conference, Essen, Germany, June 24-27 1991) identified the presence of peroxide groups, typically in the range 0.1 to 0.4 micromoles/sq meter, on the carbon black surface. However, the majority (greater than 80%) of the peroxide groups are thermally stable to heat treatment at 200 and hence cannot be considered to be potential initiating sites for radical polymerization.</p><p>Tsubokawa et al. (K. Fujiki, N. Tsubokawa, Y. Sone: Polymer J., vol. 22, number 8, pages 661-70, 1990, and N. Tsubokawa: Prog. Polymer Science, vol. 17, pages 417-70, 1992) discuss growing polymers from an activated carbon black surface by first attaching a reactive group via the oxygen groups on the carbon black surface. Typical examples include the use of glycidyl methacrylate where the glycidyl group reacts with phenolic hydroxyl groups on the carbon black surface providing a vinyl functionality; the reaction of 4,4' azo bis-(4-cyanovaleric acid) whereby the isocyanate group reacts with phenolic hydroxyl groups and subsequent heating decomposes the azo group to generate an alkyl radical; and the reaction of the phenolic hydroxyl groups with butyl lithium which can then be used as an initiation site for anionic polymerization.</p><p>All of these approaches require the presence of oxygen groups on the carbon black surface. Since the level of reactive hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups, relative to the above approaches, present on a typical furnace or thermal carbon black is typically 0.01 to 0.1 micromoles/sq meter, the number of potential initiation sites is quite low.</p><p>Further, subsequent polymerization from these activated sites will most likely occur in the normal manner for free radical polymerization with the chains being irreversible terminated by chain combination reactions, combination with unreacted oxygen groups on the carbon black surface, and/or the addition of chain stoppers. In all cases the polymerization cannot be reinitiated. Accordingly, there is a need to provide particles with attached stable free radicals which overcome the above-described limitations.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>A feature of the present invention is to provide means of attaching a stable free radical onto a particle.</p><p>Another feature of the present invention is to provide modified particles having an attached stable free radical and to further provide modified particles having an attached polymer which is capped with the stable free radical.</p><p>Other features of the present invention relate to the making and using of such modified particles.</p><p>Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present invention.</p><p>To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention relates to a modified particle which includes a particle having an attached group having the formula: ##STR4## wherein Ar represents an aromatic group; R.sup.1 represents a bond, an arylene group, an alkylene ##STR5## wherein R.sup.4 is an alkyl or alkylene group or an aryl or arylene group; R.sup.2 and R.sup.3, which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, --OR.sup.5, --NHR.sup.5, --NR.sup.5 R.sup.5 or --SR.sup.5, wherein R.sup.5, which can be the same or different, represents hydrogen, an alkyl group or an aryl group; and SFR represents a stable free radical.</p><p>The present invention further relates to a modified particle or aggregate wherein the particle or aggregate is a carbon-metal phase aggregate, a carbon-silicon containing species phase aggregate, a metal oxide, or a metal hydroxide. Attached to the particle or aggregate is a group having the formula: ##STR6## wherein CoupA represents a Si-containing group, a Ti-containing group, or a Zr-containing group; R.sup.8 and R.sup.9, which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, --OR.sup.10, --NHR.sup.10, --NR.sup.10 OR.sup.10, or --SR.sup.10, wherein R.sup.10, which can be the same or different, represents hydrogen, an alkyl group or an aryl group; SFR represents a stable free radical, and n is an integer of from 1 to 3.</p><p>The present invention further relates to a modified particle with an attached polymer wherein the modified particle has an attached group having the formula: ##STR7## wherein X represents a polymer formed from at least one polymerizable vinyl or diene based monomer, Ar represents an aromatic group; R.sup.1 represents a bond, an arylene group, an alkylene ##STR8## wherein R.sup.4 is an alkyl or alkylene group or an aryl or arylene group; R.sup.2 and R.sup.3, which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, --OR.sup.5, --NHR.sup.5, --NR.sup.5 R.sup.5 or --SR.sup.5, wherein R.sup.5, which can be the same or different, represents an alkyl group or an aryl group; and SFR represents a stable free radical.</p><p>The present invention also relates to another modified particle having an attached polymer. The particle is a carbon-metal phase aggregate, a carbon-silicon containing species phase aggregate, a metal oxide, or a metal hydroxide. Attached to the particle is a group having the formula: ##STR9## wherein CoupA represents a Si-containing group, a Ti-containing group, or a Zr-containing group; R.sup.8 and R.sup.9, which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, --OR.sup.10, --NHR.sup.10, --NR.sup.10 R.sup.10, or --SR.sup.10, wherein R.sup.10, which can be the same or different, represents an alkyl group or an aryl group; SFR represents a stable free radical, X is a polymer formed from at least one polymerizable monomer, and n is an integer of from 1 to 3.</p><p>The present invention, in addition, relates to a method for preparing and using these various modified particles. The method includes reacting a particle having an attached vinyl substituted aromatic group with a reactive free radical source and a stable free radical source to form a reaction product. The present application further relates to forming the modified particles with an attached polymer by reacting the reaction product with a polymerizable monomer.</p><p>The present invention, in addition, relates to a modified particle which includes a particle having an organic group having a --SFR group, where the organic group is directly attached to the particle. The modified particle can also be a particle having an organic group having an --X--SFR group, where the organic group is directly attached to the particle.</p><p>It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further explanation of the present invention, as claimed.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p>In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a modified particle comprising a particle having attached a group having the formula: ##STR10## wherein Ar represents an aromatic group which is attached to the particle; R.sup.1 represents a bond, ##STR11## wherein R.sup.4 is an alkyl or alkylene group or an aryl or arylene group; R.sup.2 and R.sup.3, which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, --OR.sup.5, --NHR.sup.5, --NR.sup.5 R.sup.5, or --SR.sup.5, wherein R.sup.5, which can be the same or different, represents an alkyl group or an aryl group; and SFR represents a stable free radical.</p><p>The particle, which is modified, can be any particle capable of having a group represented by any one of formulas described herein attached thereto, such as formula (I)-(IV). Preferably, the particle has a carbon reactive site (C--), since in a preferred embodiment for the groups of formula (I) and (III), --SFR and --X--SFR are preferably attached through a carbon bond on the particle. The particle, for instance, can be carbon products, metal oxides (e.g., silica), metal hydroxides, multi-phase aggregates comprising a carbon phase and a silicon-containing species phase, multi-phase aggregates comprising a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase, and the like. The carbon may be of the crystalline and/or amorphous type. Examples of carbon products include but are not limited to, graphite, carbon black, vitreous carbon, activated charcoal, activated carbon, carbon fiber, and mixtures thereof. Finely divided forms of the above are preferred. Most preferably, the particle is a carbon product, and most preferably carbon black.</p><p>The multi-phase aggregate containing the carbon phase and the silicon-containing species phase can also be considered a silicon-treated carbon black aggregate and the multi-phase aggregate containing a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase can be considered to be a metal-treated carbon black aggregate as long as one realizes that in either case, the silicon-containing species and/or metal-containing species are a phase of the aggregate just like the carbon phase. The multi-phase aggregates do not represent a mixture of discrete carbon black aggregates and discrete silica or metal aggregates. Rather, the multi-phase aggregates used in the present invention include at least one silicon-containing or metal-containing region concentrated at or near the surface of the aggregate (but put of the aggregate) and/or within the aggregate.</p><p>The aggregate, thus contains at least two phases, one of which is carbon and the other of which is a silicon-containing species, a metal-containing species, or both. The silicon-containing species that can be a part of the aggregate is not attached to a carbon black aggregate like a silica coupling agent, but actually is part of the same aggregate as the carbon phase. For instance, when the multi-phase aggregate having a carbon phase and a silicon-containing species phase is examined under STEM-EDX, the silicon signal corresponding to the silicon-containing species is found to be present in individual carbon black aggregates. By comparison, for example, in a physical mixture of silica and carbon black, STEM-EDX examination reveals distinctly separate silica and carbon black aggregates.</p><p>The metal-treated carbon blacks are aggregates containing at least a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase. The metal-containing species include compounds containing aluminum, zinc, magnesium, calcium, titanium, vandium, cobalt, nickel, zirconium, tin, antimony, chromium, neodymium, lead, tellurium, barium, cesium, iron, and molybdenum. Preferably, the metal-containing species phase is an aluminum- or zinc-containing species phase. The metal-containing species phase can be distributed through at least a portion of the aggregate and is an intrinsic part of the aggregate.</p><p>Further, it is within the bounds of the present invention to have a metal-treated carbon black containing more than one type of metal-containing species phase or the metal-treated carbon black can also contain a silicon-containing species phase and/or a boron-containing species phase. For example, the metal-treated carbon black of the present invention can have an aggregate comprising a carbon phase, an aluminum-containing species phase, and a zinc-containing species phase. Accordingly, the multi-phase aggregates used in the present invention can have two or more different types of metal-containing species phases and/or additional non-metal species phases.</p><p>Preferably, for purposes of the present invention, the amount of elemental silicon and/or elemental metal present in the multi-phase aggregate is from about 0.1 to about 25 wt. %, more preferably, from about 0.5 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, and most preferably from about 0.2 wt. % to about 5.4 wt. %, by weight of the aggregate.</p><p>The details of making the multi-phase aggregates are explained in U.S. patent application Ser.

The particle can be a metal oxide, a metal hydroxide, an aggregate comprising a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase, or an aggregate comprising a carbon phase and a silicon-containing species phase. Attached to this particle or aggregate is a group having the formula: ##STR13## wherein CoupA represents a Si-containing group, a Ti-containing group, or a Zr-containing group; R.sup.8 and R.sup.9, which can be the same or different, represent hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, --OR.sup.10, --NHR.sup.10, --NR.sup.10 R.sup.10, or --SR.sup.10, wherein R.sup.10 represents an alkyl group or an aryl group; SFR represents a stable free radical, and where n is an integer of from 1 to 3. Preferably, CoupA is attached to the particle or aggregate, especially in the case of a Si-containing group, via an oxygen radical which can form a part of a CoupA.</p><p>Examples of Si-containing groups include, but are not limited to, dimethylsilylmethyl, dialkoxysilylmethyl, and the like. Examples of Ti-containing groups include, but are not limited to, alpha substituted tri-acetyl titanate and the like.

Likewise, examples of the substituent R.sup.10 can be the same as the substituent R.sup.5 discussed above. Also, the SFR is the same as discussed above.</p><p>The modified particles having the attached group of the formulas, such as formula (I), can be made in the following manner. A particle, such as carbon black, can first have a vinyl substituted aromatic group attached to the particle. This attachment can be accomplished by the methods described in PCT International Application No. WO 96/18688 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,630,868; 5,559,169; 5,571,311; 5,851,280; and 5,559,169, all of which are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference herein.</p><p>The particle having the attached vinyl substituted aromatic group is then reacted with a reactive free radical source and a stable free radical source for a sufficient time and at a sufficient temperature to form the modified particle having the attached group, like that of formula I. The molar ratio of the reactive free radical source to the stable free radical source is from about 0.7 to about 2.0, and preferably from about 0.9 to about 1.1. Examples of the reactive free radical source include but are not limited to radicals generated from organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxides and azo initiators such as azobisisobutyronitrile, and the like. The reactive free radical source is present in amounts sufficient to react with the vinyl aromatic group present on the particle. Preferably, the amount of the reactive radical source is from about 0.01 mmoles/g (of particle) to about 10 mmoles/g and more preferably from about 0.01 to about 5 mmoles/g.</p><p>Alternatively, the modified particles of the present invention can be made by first forming the groups of the formulas described above, such as formula (I). Preferably, the stable free radical group is attached in the meta or para position of the aromatic group. This group is then attached to the particle by a diazonium treatment in the manner described in the above referenced patents and patent applications, where a diazonium salt will first be formed containing a group of one of the formulas described above in the manner described in the above-referenced patents. The groups of the formulas can be then subsequently attached to the particle. In a less preferred way, the formulas of the present invention can be attached to the particle through a hydroxyl or carbonoyl group present on the particle.</p><p>Also, the modified particle of the present invention can be formed by attaching a stable free radical compound containing at least one alkoxy silyl, alkoxy titanyl, or alkoxy zirconyl group to the particle which, in this particular process is preferably a metal oxide or metal hydroxide, or a carbon surface. This particular embodiment would attach a group of formula (II) or (IV) to a particle.</p><p>In another process, the modified particle can be formed by first taking an aromatic group and reacting it with a compound to form the groups of the formulas described above except for the presence of the --SFR group. In other words, a group having the formula Ar--R.sup.1 --CR.sup.2 R.sup.3 would first be formed and then the --SFR would be attached to this group to form a group of formula (I) of the present invention which can then be attached to the particle. In this process, R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 are preferably hydrogen.</p><p>Alternatively, the process of making the modified particles of the present invention can be a three step process where Ar is first attached to the particle and then the group having the formula R.sup.1 C--R.sup.2 R.sup.3 can be attached to the aromatic group. Then in a third step, the --SFR can be attached to the R.sup.1 --C--R.sup.2 R.sup.3 group.</p><p>Also, in making the modified particles having the attached group of one the formulas described above, an aliphatic vinyl group can be attached to the particle surface by a diazotisation of a vinyl substituted amino aromatic compound, or a vinyl substituted alkoxy silyl, titanyl, or zirconyl derivate. The vinyl group is then reacted with an organic peroxide and a stable free radical such that the organic peroxide and stable free radical are present in an amount sufficient to react with at least one percent of the vinyl groups and preferably from about 50 to about 100% of the vinyl groups and the mole ratios of the organic peroxide to stable free radical are preferably from about 0.5:1 to about 1:1.</p><p>The modified particles of formula (II) can be made in the following manner. The aggregate comprising a carbon phase and a metal-containing species phase can be made as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/828,725, hereby incorporated herein by reference. The aggregate comprising a carbon phase and a metal containing species phase can be made as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/446,141 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,930) and Ser. No. 08/750,017. The aggregate or particle can then be reacted with a coupling agent by adding the coupling agent to the aggregate in a medium and mixing. Then, the aggregate or particle having the attached coupling group can be reacted with a reactive radical source and stable free radical source as described above.</p><p>For purposes of the above-described reactions, the reaction should occur for a time and temperature sufficient to form the attached group onto the particle or aggregate. Generally, this time is from about 3 minutes to about 96 hours and more preferably from about 1 hour to about 24 hours. The temperature of the reaction is dependent on the half-life of the peroxide, preferably from about 50 more preferably from about 75</p><p>With the modified particles described above, polymers can be attached onto these attached groups by reacting these modified particles or aggregates with a polymerizable monomer such as a vinyl or diene containing monomer. Specific examples of such monomers include, but are not limited to styene, isoprene, butadiene, chloromethylstyrene, methyl methacrylate, and butyl methacrylate, as well as acrylic acid and esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and esters of methacrylic acid. Mixtures of two or more monomers can be also used.</p><p>The polymerization reaction is conducted under conditions which permits the polymerization of the monomer so that it forms a part of the attached group onto the particle or aggregate. These conditions are preferably heating modified particles with a monomer above 80 from about 120 presence of a solvent. The reaction can be ended by lowering the temperature below 80 subjected to distillation, steam stripping, or precipitation or other known methods in order to remove residual monomers and solvents.</p><p>The polymerization reaction thus can produce any length of polymer on the modified particle or aggregate. For example, polymers having average molecular weights, preferably ranging from about 1,000 to about 1,000,000 can be made. The polymers can be any type, such as homopolymers, co-polymers, ter-polymers, or higher chain polymers. The polymers can also be block, graft, or random-type polymers.</p><p>Once the polymerization occurs, the modified particle will have a group attached having the formula: ##STR14## wherein the substituents are the same as described earlier for formula (I) and X is a polymer formed from at least one polymerizable monomer.</p><p>Similarly, when the modified particle or aggregate having a group of formula (II) is polymerized by the introduction of one or more monomers, the group attached to the particle or aggregate will have the formula: ##STR15## wherein the substituents are the same as described in formula (II) and X is a polymer formed from at least one polymerizable monomer.</p><p>In another embodiment, a modified particle has an organic group containing a --SFR group directly attached to the particle. Preferably, the --SFR group is directly attached to the particle. The --SFR group and particle can be the same as discussed above. This type of modified particle can be prepared by heating a particle, like carbon black, with a organic group comprising a stable free radical in a solvent, such as toluene and preferably, in an inert atmosphere. With this modified particle having an attached organic group having a --SFR group, polymers can be attached onto the --SFR group by reacting the modified particle with a polymerizable monomer as discussed above using the same procedure.</p><p>The modified particles of the present invention can form part of a polymeric composition and be present with other ingredients commonly used and found in polymeric compositions.</p><p>The modified particle of the present invention can be used in a variety of applications. For instance, it can be used in coating or ink compositions, such as printing inks and ink jet inks, toners, automobile coatings, and the like. Also, the modified particles can be used as reinforcers for compositions, such as polymeric compositions and can also serve as impact modifiers, or as agents used to increase compatibility of a polymeric composition.</p><p>The present invention will be further clarified by the following examples, which are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><heading>Example 1</heading><p>Attachment of 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidinyloxy free radical (TEMPO) to carbon black.</p><p>TEMPO and carbon black grade Vulcan 7H were added to toluene and heated under an inert atmosphere at 130 was filtered from the toluene, washed with deionized water, and dried.</p><p>Kjeld analysis of the resultant carbon black indicated that the nitrogen content of the carbon black had increased from 0.040% to 0.57% by weight.
