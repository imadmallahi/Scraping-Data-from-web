In 1983, the etiological cause of AIDS was determined to be the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By December of 1990, the World Health organization estimated that between 8 and 10 million people worldwide were infected with HIV, and of that number, between 1,000,000 and 1,400,000 were in the U.S.</p><p>In 1985, it was reported that the synthetic nucleoside 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus. Since then, a number of other synthetic nucleosides, including 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), 21,3'-dideoxycytidine (DDC), 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (FLT), and 2',3.sup.1 -dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (D4T), have been proven to be effective against HIV. A number of other 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides have been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of a variety of viruses in vitro. It appears that, after cellular phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate by cellular kinases, these synthetic nucleosides are incorporated into a growing strand of viral DNA, causing chain termination due to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group.</p><p>The success of various 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides in inhibiting the replication of HIV in vivo or in vitro has led a number of researchers to design and test nucleosides that substitute a heteroatom for the carbon atom at the 3'-position of the nucleoside. Norbeck, et al., disclose that (.+-.)-1-[(2β,4β)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-dioxolanyl]thymine (referred to as (+)-dioxolane-T) exhibits a modest activity against HIV (EC.sub.50 of 20 μm in ATH8 cells), and is not toxic to uninfected control cells at a concentration of 200 μM. Tetrahedron Letters 30 (46), 6246, (1989). European Patent Application Publication No. 0 337 713 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,449, assigned to IAF BioChem International, Inc., disclose 2-substituted-4-substituted-1,3-dioxolanes that exhibit antiviral activity.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,407 and European Patent Application Publication No. 0 382 526, also assigned to IAF Biochem International, Inc. disclose a number of 2-substituted-5-substituted-1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides with antiviral activity, and specifically report that the racemic mixture (about the C4'-position) of the C1'-β isomer of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane (referred to below as (.+-.)-BCH-189) has approximately the same activity against HIV as AZT, and no cellular toxicity at the tested levels. (.+-.)-BCH-189 has also been found to inhibit the replication of AZT-resistant HIV isolates in vitro from patients who have been treated with AZT for longer than 36 weeks.</p><p>Another virus that causes a serious human health problem is the hepatitis B virus (referred to below as "HBV"). HBV is second only to tobacco as a cause of human cancer. The mechanism by which HBV induces cancer is unknown, although it is postulated that it may directly trigger tumor development, or indirectly trigger tumor development through chronic inflammation, cirrhosis, and cell regeneration associated with the infection.</p><p>After a two to six month incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood levels of certain enzymes. HBV can cause fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often fatal form of the disease in which massive sections of the liver are destroyed.</p><p>Patients typically recover from acute hepatitis. In some patients, however, high levels of viral antigen persist in the blood for an extended, or indefinite, period, causing a chronic infection. Chronic infections can lead to chronic persistent hepatitis. Patients infected with chronic persistent HBV are most common in developing countries. By mid-1991, there were approximately 225 million chronic carriers of HBV in Asia alone, and worldwide, almost 300 million carriers. Chronic persistent hepatitis can cause fatigue, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer.</p><p>In western industrialized countries, high risk groups for HBV infection include those in contact with HBV carriers or their blood samples. The epidemiology of HBV is very similar to that of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which accounts for why HBV infection is common among patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex. However, HBV is more contagious than HIV.</p><p>A human serum-derived vaccine has been developed to immunize patients against HBV. While it has been found effective, production of the vaccine is troublesome because the supply of human serum from chronic carriers is limited, and the purification procedure is long and expensive. Further, each batch of vaccine prepared from different serum must be tested in chimpanzees to ensure safety. Vaccines have also been produced through genetic engineering. Daily treatments with a-interferon, a genetically engineered protein, has also shown promise. However, to date there is no known pharmaceutical agent that effectively inhibits the replication of the virus.</p><p>To market a nucleoside for pharmaceutical purposes, it must not only be efficacious with low toxicity, it must also be cost effective to manufacture. An extensive amount of research and development has been directed toward new, low cost processes for large scale nucleoside production. 2',3'-Dideoxynucleosides are currently prepared by either of two routes: derivatization of an intact nucleoside or condensation of a derivatized sugar moiety with a heterocyclic base. Although there are numerous disadvantages associated with obtaining new nucleoside analogues by modifying intact nucleosides, a major advantage of this approach is that the appropriate absolute stereochemistry has already been set by nature. However, this approach cannot be used in the production of nucleosides that contain either nonnaturally occurring bases or nonnaturally occurring carbohydrate moieties (and which therefore are not prepared from intact nucleosides), such as 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides and 1,3-dioxolane nucleosides.</p><p>When condensing a carbohydrate or carbohydrate-like moiety with a heterocyclic base to form a synthetic nucleoside, a nucleoside is produced that has two chiral centers (at the C1' and C4'-positions), and thus exists as a diastereomeric pair. Each diastereomer exists as a set of enantiomers. Therefore, the product is a mixture of four enantiomers.</p><p>It is often found that nucleosides with nonnaturally-occurring stereochemistry in either the C1' or the C4'-positions are less active than the same nucleoside with the stereochemistry as set by nature. For example, Carter, et al., have reported that the concentration of the (-)-enantiomer of carbovir (2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine) in cell culture required to reduce the reverse transcriptase activity by 50% (EC.sub.50) is 0.8 μM, whereas the EC.sub.50 for the (+)-enantiomer of carbovir is greater than 60 μM. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 34:6, 1297-1300 (June 1990).</p><p>PCT International Publication No. WO 91/11186 discloses that 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides can be prepared with high diastereoselectivity (high percentage of nucleoside with a β configuration of the bond from the C1'-carbon to the heterocyclic base) by careful selection of the Lewis acid used in the condensation process. It was discovered that condensation of a 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside with a base occurs with almost complete β-stereospecificity when stannic chloride is used as the condensation catalyst. Other Lewis acids provide low (or no) C1'-β selectivity or simply fail to catalyze the reactions.</p><p>In light of the fact that acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS-related complex, and hepatitis B virus have reached epidemic levels worldwide, and have tragic effects on the infected patient, there remains a strong need to provide new effective pharmaceutical agents to treat these diseases that have low toxicity to the host.</p><p>There is also a need to provide a cost effective, commercially viable method to produce pharmaceutically important nucleosides, and specifically attain β-stereospecificity in the C4'-position of synthetic nucleosides prepared by condensing a carbohydrate-like moiety with a base.</p><p>Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and composition for the treatment of human patients infected with HIV.</p><p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and composition for the treatment of human patients or other host animals infected with HBV.</p><p>It is still another object of the present invention to provide enantiomerically enriched 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides.</p><p>It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for the resolution of C4'-enantiomers of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>A method and composition for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections in humans and other host animals is disclosed that includes administering an effective amount of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, including a 5' or N.sup.4 alkylated or acylated derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p>It has been discovered that 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane ("FTC"), exhibits surprisingly high activity against human immunodeficiency virus with very low host cell toxicity. It has also been discovered that FTC exhibits very significant activity against HBV, and therefore can be used to treat patients who have a variety of illnesses associated with HBV infection.</p><p>Toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies confirm the usefulness of FTC as an antiviral agent for pharmaceutical administration. FTC and its enantiomers are nontoxic to peripheral human bone marrow cells at concentrations up to 50 μM and other cell lines at concentrations up to 200 μM. FTC-TP is a major intracellular metabolite in PBMC and HepG2 cells. FTC-TP competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with a K.sub.I of 0.2 μM using a poly(I)oligo(dC) template-primer. Using sequencing analysis, FTC-TP can be shown to be a potent DNA chain terminator when HIV-RT is used (C-stops).</p><p>Chronic treatment with FTC is not toxic to rodents, even at oral doses of 85 mg/kg per day for at least two months. The pharmacokinetics of FTC in rhesus monkeys indicates high oral bioavailability (approximately 73.+-.6%) and a plasma terminal half life of approximately 1.34.+-18 (mean of oral and I.V. administration).</p><p>A process for the resolution of a racemic mixture of nucleoside enantiomers, including the racemic mixture of FTC, is also disclosed that includes the step of exposing the racemic mixture to an enzyme that preferentially catalyzes a reaction in one of the enantiomers. The process can be used to resolve a wide variety of nucleosides, including pyrimidine and purine nucleosides that are optionally substituted in the carbohydrate moiety or base moiety. The process can also be used to resolve nucleoside derivatives that contain additional heteroatoms in the carbohydrate moiety, for example, (.+-.)-FTC and (.+-.)-BCH-189. The resolution of nucleosides can be performed on large scale at moderate cost.</p><p>Using methods described herein, FTC was resolved into its (+)-β-D and (-)-β-L enantiomers. The (-)-β-L-enantiomer appears to be more potent that the (+)-β-D-enantiomer against HIV, HBV, and SIV. The (+)-enantiomer of FTC is also active against HIV, HBV, and SIV.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p>FIG. 1 is an illustration of the chemical structure of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane ("FTC").</p><p>FIG. 2 is an illustration of a method for the preparation of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane.</p><p>FIG. 3 is a flow chart of the specificity of alkaline phosphatase and snake venom phosphodiesterase for the (+) and (-) enantiomers of FTC.</p><p>FIG. 4 is a graph indicating the progress of lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5'-butyryl ester of FTC over time using the enzymes Amano PS-800 (-open square-) and PLE (-open circle with dot-).</p><p>FIG. 5 is a graph of the effect of concentration (μM) of racemic and enantiomerically enriched FTC (prepared by the method of Example 4) versus the percent inhibition of human PBM cells infected with HIV-1.

Nonlimiting examples are the pharmaceutically acceptable salts (alternatively referred to as "physiologically acceptable salts"), and the 5' and N.sup.4 acylated or alkylated derivatives of the active compound (alternatively referred to as "physiologically active derivatives").

The reaction was quenched with a small amount of ice water. The liquid was decanted off from the salt and evaporated in vacuo. The remaining salt was dissolved in water and the aqueous solution was extracted twice with ethyl ether. The combined other layers were washed once with saturated CuSO.sub.4, twice with saturated NaHCO.sub.3 containing Norit then vacuum filtered through a celite</p><p>The concentrated reaction mixture was dissolved in ether and washed following the same procedure as above for the salt solution. The combined organic layers were concentrated by rotary evaporation, then placed under vacuum. This reaction is typically very close to quantitative. The scale can be easily increased as necessary. The product, 1,4-dibutyryl-2-butene-1,4-diol is a colorless to slightly yellow, clear liquid.</p><p>Ozonolysis of the protected diol</p><p>1,4-Dibutyryl-2-butene-1,4-diol (1.365 mol) was dissolved in 4L of dry CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 in a dry, 5L 3-neck flask equipped with a large drying tube and an open tube for the introduction of gas. The tube is optimally not a fritted, gas bubbling tube that will clog on exposure to the concentrated solution. The solution was stirred and cooled to -78 C. while inert gas was bubbled through the solution. The gas inlet was sealed once the solution had cooled sufficiently, and the flask and stirring apparatus were moved to the ozone generator. Oxygen was bubbled through the stirring solution for at least 20 minutes while maintaining the ice bath. A Cryocool is ideal to maintain the low temperature for this lengthy reaction. The ozone was then introduced at 8 to 8.5 psi. Upon completion, the ozone flow was stopped, and oxygen was bubbled through the solution for about a half an hour before 3 equivalents of Me.sub.2 S were added. The flask was removed from the cooling bath and transported to a hood where it was stirred for about 2 days to affect complete reduction. The solution was evaporated and put under vacuum for several hours.</p><p>This reaction typically yields approximately 95% of protected aldehyde (2-butyryloxyacetaldehyde), a colorless to yellow, clear liquid.</p><p>Cyclization of the Aldehyde with Mercaptoacetic acid</p><p>The aldehyde (1.0 equivalent) was dissolved in toluene to provide a 0.80 to 0.85M solution in a flask equipped with a Dean Stark-type trap. Thioglycolic acid (1.1 equiv.) was added and the mixture was heated to reflux. Water was azeotropically removed via the trap. The reaction was completed in 3 hours and was allowed to cool to room temperature. The organic solution was washed twice with equal volumes of sat. NaHCO.sub.3 water and once with water, dried over MgSO.sub.4 and Norit, and vacuum filtered through celite before being evaporated in vacuo. The first NaHCO.sub.3 wash was back extracted once with ether; the ether was washed once with water, dried over MgSO.sub.4 and Norit through celite from the toluene solution. The combined material was placed under vacuum overnight.</p><p>The reaction typically provides a 90% yield of 2-(butyryloxy)-methyl-5-oxo-1,3-oxathiolane.</p><p>Reduction of Lactone and Conversion to the Acetate</p><p>2-Butyryloxy-methyl-5-oxo-1,3-oxathiolane (1.00 equivalent) was dissolved in dry THF to give a 0.23M solution in a dry, 3-neck flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and maintained under an inert atmosphere. The solution was stirred and cooled to 0 Li(t-BuO).sub.3 AlH in THF was added via canula. The reduction was complete in approximately three hours, as indicated by TLC using 2:1 ether/hexane solvent system and an anisaldehyde stain.</p><p>Approximately 10 equivalents of freshly distilled Ac.sub.2 O were then added and allowed to stir for 2 days to provide the acetylated product. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated NaHCO.sub.3, which was stirred overnight. The solution was then evaporated and stirred with more NaHCO.sub.3 solution overnight. This was extracted with ether which was washed (carefully) twice with sat. NaHCO.sub.3 and once with water, dried over MgSO.sub.4 and Norit evaporated. The product is a dark yellow, clear liquid.

The flask was then sealed tightly and the solvent removed using a vacuum pump with an auxiliary trap. The product, a white solid, was left under vacuum over night until ready for use in the following coupling reaction.</p><p>Coupling of Silylated 5-Fluorocytosine with Acetylated Lactol</p><p>To silylated 5-fluorocytosine (33.86 gm. 0.124 mol) in dry dichloromethane (350 ml) was added SnCl.sub.4 solution (135.6 ml, a 1 molar solution in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2) under nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. This solution was cannulated to the solution of the lactol acetate (38 gm, 0.113 mol) in dichloromethane (400 ml) under nitrogen atmosphere over a period of 30 minutes.</p><p>The reaction solution was stirred for 2 hours, at which point the completion of reaction was indicated by TLC. The reaction solution was then diluted with dichloromethane (500 ml) and quenched with ammonium hydroxide solution. The ammonium hydroxide solution (100 ml) was added slowly maintaining the temperature of reaction below 30 resulting in the formation of a white precipitate.</p><p>The mixture was allowed to stir for another 30 minutes, and then passed through silica gel plug column (7 inch diameter 5 inch height).

Resolution of Nucleoside Enantiomers</p><p>A method is provided herein for the resolution of racemic mixtures of nucleoside enantiomers, including but not limited to the (+) and (-) enantiomers of FTC. The method can also be used to resolve racemic mixtures of carbohydrates or carbohydrate-like moieties, such as derivatives of 1,3-oxathiolane and 1,3-dioxolane. The method involves the use of an enzyme that preferentially catalyzes a reaction of one enantiomer in a racemic mixture. The reacted enantiomer is separated from the unreacted enantiomer on the basis of the new difference in physical structure. Given the disclosure herein, one of skill in the art will be able to choose an enzyme that is selective for the nucleoside enantiomer of choice (or selective for the undesired enantiomer, as a method of eliminating it), by selecting one of the enzymes discussed below or by systematic evaluation of other known enzymes. Given this disclosure, one of skill in the art will also know how to modify the substrate as necessary to attain the desired resolution. Through the use of either chiral NMR shift reagents, polarimetry, or chiral HPLC, the optical enrichment of the recovered ester can be determined.</p><p>The following examples further illustrate the use of enzymes to resolve racemic mixtures of enantiomers. Other known methods of resolution of racemic mixtures can be used in combination with the method of resolution disclosed herein. All of these modifications are considered within the scope of the invention.</p><p>Resolution Based on Hydrolysis of C5'-Nucleoside Esters</p><p>In one embodiment, the method includes reacting the C5'-hydroxyl group of a mixture of nucleoside racemates with an acyl compound to form C5'-esters in which the nucleoside is in the "carbinol" end of the ester. The racemic mixture of nucleoside C5'-esters is then treated with an enzyme that preferentially cleaves, or hydrolyses, one of the enantiomers and not the other, in a given time period.</p><p>An advantage of this method is that it can be used to resolve a wide variety of nucleosides, including pyrimidine and purine nucleosides that are optionally substituted in the carbohydrate moiety or base moiety. The method can also be used to resolve nucleoside derivatives that contain additional heteroatoms in the carbohydrate moiety, for example, FTC and BCH-189. The broad applicability of this method resides in part on the fact that although the carbinol portion of the ester plays a role in the ability of an enzyme to differentiate enantiomers, the major recognition site for these enzymes is in the carboxylic acid portion of the ester. Further, one may be able to successfully extrapolate the results of one enzyme/substrate study to another, seemingly-different system, provided that the carboxylic acid portions of the two substrates are the same or substantially similar.</p><p>Another advantage of this method is that it is regioselective. Enzymes that hydrolyse esters typically do not catalyze extraneous reactions in other portions of the molecule. For example, the enzyme lipase catalyses the hydrolysis of the ester of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-oxo-1,3-oxathiolane without hydrolysing the internal lactone. This contrasts markedly with "chemical" approaches to ester hydrolysis.</p><p>Still another advantage of this method is that the separation of the unhydrolysed enantiomer and the hydrolysed enantiomer from the reaction mixture is quite simple. The unhydrolysed enantiomer is more lipophilic than the hydrolysed enantiomer and can be efficiently recovered by simple extraction with one of a wide variety of nonpolar organic solvents or solvent mixtures, including hexane and hexane/ether. The less lipophilic, more polar hydrolysed enantiomer can then be obtained by extraction with a more polar organic solvent, for example, ethyl acetate, or by lyophilization, followed by extraction with ethanol or methanol. Alcohol should be avoided during the hydrolysis because it can denature enzymes under certain conditions.</p><p>Enzymes and Substrates</p><p>With the proper matching of enzyme and substrate, conditions can be established for the isolation of either nucleoside enantiomer. The desired enantiomer can be isolated by treatment of the racemic mixture with an enzyme that hydrolyses the desired enantiomer (followed by extraction of the polar hydrolysate with a polar solvent) or by treatment with an enzyme that hydrolyses the undesired enantiomer (followed by removal of the undesired enantiomer with a nonpolar solvent).</p><p>Enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of esters include esterases, for example pig liver esterase, lipases, including porcine pancreatic lipase and Amano PS-800 lipase, substillisin, and α-chymotrypsin.</p><p>FIG. 3 is a flow chart of the specificity of alkaline phosphatase and snake venom phosphodiesterase for the (+) and (-) enantiomers of FTC. As indicated, alkaline phosphatase hydrolyses the triphosphate of both of the enantiomers to FTC, and therefore is not effective as a separation means. Phosphodiesterase I preferentially hydrolyses the (+)-isomer of FTC to its monoester, which can then be exposed to 5'-nucleotidase to provide (+)-FTC.</p><p>The most effective acyl group to be used to esterify the C5'-position of the nucleoside can be determined without undue experimentation by evaluation of a number of homologs using the selected enzyme system. For example, when 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides are esterified with butyric acid, resolutions with both pig liver esterase and Amano PS-800 proceed with high enantioselectivity (94-100% enantiomeric excess) and opposite selectivity. Pig liver esterase preferentially hydrolyses the (+)-enantiomer of FTC, and Amano PS-800 (-)-enantiomer of FTC. The percent enantiomeric excess reported in Table 1 is the amount of purified butyrate ester remaining in the enzyme treated mixture (i.e., the butyrate ester of (-)-FTC in the case of PLE and the butyrate ester of (+)-FTC in the case of Amano PS-800</p><p>Non-limiting examples of acyl groups that can be evaluated for use with a particular nucleoside enantiomeric mixture and particular enzyme include alkyl carboxylic acids and substituted alkyl carboxylic acids, including acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and pentanoic acid. With certain enzymes, it may be preferred to use an acyl compound that is significantly electron-withdrawing to facilitate hydrolysis by weakening the ester bond. Examples of electron-withdrawing acyl groups include α-haloesters such as 2-chloropropionic acid, 2-chlorobutyric acid, and 2-chloropentanoic acid. α-Haloesters are excellent substrates for lipases.</p><p>Resolution Conditions</p><p>The enzymatic hydrolyses are typically carried out with a catalytic amount of the enzyme in an aqueous buffer that has a pH that is close to the optimum pH for the enzyme in question. As the reaction proceeds, the pH drops as a result of liberated carboxylic acid. Aqueous base should be added to maintain the pH near the optimum value for the enzyme. The progress of the reaction can be easily determined by monitoring the change in pH and the amount of base needed to maintain pH. The hydrophobic ester (the unhydrolysed enantiomer) and the more polar alcohol (the hydrolysed enantiomer) can be sequentially and selectively extracted from the solution by the judicious choice of organic solvents. Alternatively, the material to be resolved can be passed through a column that contains the enzyme immobilized on a solid support.</p><p>Enzymatic hydrolyses performed under heterogeneous conditions can suffer from poor reproducibility. Therefore, it is preferred that the hydrolysis be performed under homogeneous conditions. Alcohol solvents are not preferred because they can denature the enzymes. Homogeneity can be achieved through the use of non-ionic surfactants, such as Triton X-100. However, addition of these surfactants not only assists in dissolving the starting material, they also enhance the aqueous solubility of the product. Therefore, although the enzymatic reaction can proceed more effectively with the addition of a non-ionic surfactant than under heterogeneous conditions, the isolation of both the recovered starting material and the product can be made more difficult. The product can be isolated with appropriate chromatographic and chemical (e.g., selective salt formation) techniques. Diacylated nucleosides can be used but are often quite lipophilic and hard to dissolve in the medium used.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading><heading>Enantioselective Lipase-Catalyzed Hydrolysis of FTC Esters</heading><p>A number of 5'-O-acyl derivatives of FTC were prepared by selective O-acylation of the N-hydrochloride salt (see Table 1 and FIG. 4) of (.+-.)-FTC. The efficiency of the hydrolysis of the derivatives by lipases was investigated. As shown in Table 1, pig liver esterase (PLE) exhibits a high level of selectivity for the hydrolysis of the ester of the (+)-enantiomer of FTC, leaving predominately the butyrate of (-)-FTC in the HPLC-analyzed mixture. In contrast, PS-800 hydrolyses the ester of the (-)-enantiomer of FTC preferentially, leaving predominately the butyrate of the (+)-FTC in the HPLC-analyzed mixture. The rate of the hydrolysis was also found to be dependent on the nature of the acyl group; the acetyl derivative was significantly slower than the butyryl derivative. It has now been discovered that the rate of the hydrolysis of the propionic acid ester of FTC is even faster than that observed for the butyrate derivative. Percent recovery and percent of enantiomeric excess were both determined using HPLC. Although the enantioselectivity is excellent when employing PLE (typically 97% e.e. or higher), additional enrichment can be accomplished-by sequential enzymatic hydrolysis reactions in which the enantiomerically-enriched butyrate from a PLE-catalyzed hydrolysis is subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by PS-800.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 1______________________________________Comparison of Effect of Ester on Enzyme Hydrolysis    Substrate        % Recovery                          % E.E.

The clear solution was stirred and treated with 26 mg of pig liver esterase (PLE-A). The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC (FIG. 4). After 20 hours (52% conversion), the reaction mixture was extracted with 2 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic layer extracts were combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO.sub.4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting residue was eluted on 2 acetate as eluant (double elution) to give, after isolation, 53 mg (36% based on starting material) of FTC butyrate which was determined to have 98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) by HPLC analysis. The enantiomerically-enriched butyrate was then treated with 1.6 mL of methanol followed by 0.38 mmol (20 mg) of sodium methoxide. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. The reaction was completed within 30 minutes. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to give a crude white solid (76 mg) that was eluted on a 1000 m pTLC using 5:1 ethyl acetate:ethanol. (-)-FTC was isolated as a white solid (33 mg; 82% yield). HPLC analysis of the FTC as its 5'-O-acetate derivative showed 97% e.e.; [α](.sup.20,.sub.D) -120.5.degree.

The clear solution was stirred and treated with 58 mg of pig liver esterase (PLE-A). The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. After 90 minutes (38% conversion), the reaction mixture was added to 150 mL of CHCl.sub.3. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer lyophilized to remove solvent. The white residue from the lyophilization was extracted with 3 absolute ethanol. The extracts were filtered, combined, and concentrated in vacuo to yield 179 mg of crude oil. The crude material was eluted on a 45 followed by 5:1 ethyl acetate-ethanol. (+)-FTC was isolated as a white solid (109 mg; 37% based on starting butyrate). HPLC analysis of the (+)-FTC as its 5'-O-acetate derivative showed 97.4% e.e.; [a]O(.sup.20,.sub.D) +113.4.degree. (c=2.53; absolute ethanol)</p><p>A similar reaction was performed using 0.12 mmol (37 mg) of the 5'-O-butyrate of FTC and 7 mg of PS-800 in 4.0 mL of 4:1 pH 8 buffer:CH.sub.3 CN. The reaction was considerably slower than that with PLE-A and required 74 hours for 59% conversion. The recovered butyrate (11.4 mg; 31% of the initial amount) was found to exhibit 94% e.e. by HPLC.</p><heading>Resolution of Nucleoside Enantiomers with Cytidine-Deoxycytidine Deaminase</heading><p>In an alternative embodiment, cytidine-deoxycytidine deaminase is used to resolve racemic mixtures of 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane and its derivatives, including 2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluoro-cytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane. The enzyme catalyses the deamination of the cytosine moiety to a uracil. It has been discovered that one of the enantiomers of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides is a preferred substrate for cytidine-deoxycytidine deaminase. The enantiomer that is not converted to a uracil derivative (and therefore is still basic) is extracted from the solution with an acidic solution. Care should be taken to avoid strong acidic solutions (pH below 3.0), that may cleave the oxathiolane ring.</p><p>Cytidine-deoxycytidine deaminase can be isolated from rat liver or human liver, or expressed from recombinant sequences in a procaryotic system such as in E. coli.</p><p>The method of resolution of cytidine nucleoside enantiomers using cytidine-deoxycytidine deaminase can be used as the sole method of resolution or can be used in combination with other methods of resolution, including resolution by enzymatic hydrolysis of 5'-O-nucleoside esters as described above.</p><heading>Combination of Enzymatic Resolution with Classical Resolution Methods</heading><p>The process described above for resolving racemic mixtures of nucleoside enantiomers can be combined with other classical methods of enantiomeric resolution to increase the optical purity of the final product.</p><p>Classical methods of resolution include a variety of physical and chemical techniques. Often the simplest and most efficient technique is recrystallization, based on the principle that racemates are often more soluble than the corresponding individual enantiomers. Recrystallization can be performed at any stage, including on the acylated compounds or the final enantiomeric product. If successful, this simple approach represents a method of choice.</p><p>When recrystallization fails to provide material of acceptable optical purity, other methods can be evaluated. If the nucleoside is basic (for example, a cytidine) one can use chiral acids that form diastereomeric mixtures that may possess significantly different solubility properties. Nonlimiting examples of chiral acids include malic acid, mandelic acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, 3-bromocamphor-8-sulfonic acid, 10-camphorsulfonic acid, and di-p-toluoyltartaric acid. Similarly, acylation of the free hydroxyl group with a chiral acid derivative also results in the formation of diastereomeric mixtures whose physical properties may differ sufficiently to permit separation.</p><p>Small amounts of enantiomerically enriched nucleosides can be obtained or purified by passing the racemic mixture through an HPLC column that has been designed for chiral separations, including cyclodextrin bonded columns marketed by Rainin Corporation.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 4</heading><heading>Separation of Racemic Mixtures of Nucleosides by RPLC</heading><p>The resolutions of the C4'-enantiomers of (.+-.)-FTC were performed using a chiral cyclodextrin bonded (cyclobond AC-I) column obtained from Rainin Corporation (Woburn, Mass.). The conditions were as follows: Isocratic 0.5% methanol in water; flow rate 1 ml/min., UV detection at 262 nm. HPLC grade methanol was obtained from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, N.J.). The racemic mixtures were injected and fractions were collected. Fractions containing each of the enantiomers were pooled, frozen, and then lyophilized. The compounds were characterized by UV spectroscopy and by their retention times on HPLC. In general, the (-)-enantiomers have lower retention times than the (+)-enantiomers (see J. Liquid Chromatography 7:353-376, 1984). The concentrations of the compounds were determined by UV spectroscopy, using a stock solution of known concentration (15 μM) prepared in water for biological evaluation.

Ability of 2-Hydroxymethyl-5-(S-Fluorocytosin-1-yl)-1,3-Oxathiolane ("FTC") to Inhibit the Replication of HIV</p><p>It is often desirable to screen a number of racemic mixtures of nucleosides as a preliminary step to determine which warrant further resolution into enantiomerically enriched components and further evaluation of antiviral activity. The ability of nucleosides to inhibit HIV can be measured by various experimental techniques. The technique used herein, and described in detail below, measures the inhibition of viral replication in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells infected with HIV-1 (strain LAV). The amount of virus produced is determined by measuring the virus-coded reverse transcriptase enzyme. The amount of enzyme produced is proportional to the amount of virus produced. Table 3 provides the EC.sub.50 values (concentration of nucleoside that inhibits the replication of the virus by 50% in PBM cells, estimated 10% error factor) and IC.sub.50 values (concentration of nucleoside that inhibits 50% of the growth of mitogen-stimulated uninfected human PBM cells) of a number of (.+-.)-1,3-oxathiolane and nucleosides.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 6</heading><heading>Anti-HIV Activity of (.+-.)-1,3-Ozathiolane Nucleosides</heading><p>A. Three-day-old phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBM cells (10.sup.6 cells/ml) from hepatitis B and HIV-1 seronegative healthy donors were infected with HIV-1 (strain LAV) at a concentration of about 100 times the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TICD 50) per ml and cultured in the presence and absence of various concentrations of antiviral compounds.</p><p>B. Approximately one hour after infection, the medium, with the compound to be tested (2 times the final concentration in medium) or without compound, was added to the flasks (5 ml; final volume 10 ml). AZT was used as a positive control.</p><p>C. The cells were exposed to the virus (about 2 determined by reverse transcriptase assay) and then placed in a CO.sub.2 incubator. HIV-1 (strain LAV) was obtained from the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga. The methods used for culturing the PBM cells, harvesting the virus and determining the reverse transcriptase activity were those described by McDougal et al. (J. Immun. Meth. 76, 171-183, 1985) and Spira et al. (J. Clin. Meth. 25, 97-99, 1987), except that fungizone was not included in the medium (see Schinazi, et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 32, 1784-1787 (1988); Id., 34:1061-1067 (1990)).</p><p>D. On day 6, the cells and supernatant were transferred to a 15 ml tube and centrifuged at about 900 g for 10 minutes. Five ml of supernatant were removed and the virus was concentrated by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 30 minutes (Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor). The solubilized virus pellet was processed for determination of the levels of reverse transcriptase. Results are expressed in dpm/ml of sampled supernatant. Virus from smaller volumes of supernatant (1 ml) can also be concentrated by centrifugation prior to solubilization and determination of reverse transcriptase levels.</p><p>The median effective (EC.sub.50) concentration was determined by the median effect method (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 30, 491-498 (1986). Briefly, the percent inhibition of virus, as determined from measurements of reverse transcriptase, is plotted versus the micromolar concentration of compound. The EC.sub.50 is the concentration of compound at which there is a 50% inhibition of viral growth.</p><p>E. Mitogen stimulated uninfected human PBM cells (3.8.times.10.sup.5 cells/ml) were cultured in the presence and absence of drug under similar conditions as those used for the antiviral assay described above. The cells were counted after 6 days using a hemacytometer and the trypan blue exclusion method, as described by Schinazi et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 22(3), 499 (1982).

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM cells) were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (2 timepoint) and incubated with addition of 10 μM FTC (specific activity about 700 dpm/pmol). Cells were exposed to the drug for 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours. At these timepoints, the medium was removed and the cells were washed two times with cold Hank's balanced salt solution. Extraction was performed with addition of 0.2 ml of 60% cold methanol/water and stored overnight at -70 centrifuged and extractions were repeated two times for 0.5 hours at -70 dryness. The residues were resuspended in 250 μl of water and aliquots of between 50 and 100 μl were analyzed by HPLC. Quantitation of intracellular parent drug and metabolic derivatives were conducted by HPLC. Because of the potential acid lability of some compounds, a buffer system close to physiological pH was used for the separation of the metabolites.</p><p>FIG. 7 is a graph of the presence (uptake) of tritiated (.+-.)-FTC in human PBM cells (average of two determinations) in time (hours) versus pmol/10.sup.6 cells.

The antiviral evaluations were performed on two separate passages of cells. All wells, in all plates, were seeded at the same density and at the same time.</p><p>Assay Parameters</p><p>Due to the inherent variations in the levels of both intracellular and extracellular HBV DNA, only depressions greater than 3.5-fold (for HBV virion DNA) or 3.0-fold (for HBV DNA replication intermediates) from the average levels for these HBV DNA forms in untreated cells are considered to be statistically significant [P&amp;lt;0.05]. The levels of integrated HBV DNA in each cellular DNA preparation (which remain constant on a per cell basis in these experiments) were used to calculate the levels of intracellular HBV DNA forms, thereby ensuring that equal amounts of cellular DNA were compared between separate samples.</p><p>Typical values for extracellular HBV virion DNA in untreated cells ranged from 50 to 150 pg/ml culture medium (average of approximately 76 pg/ml). Intracellular HBV DNA replication intermediates in untreated cells ranged from 50 to 100 pg/μg cell DNA (average approximately 74 pg/μg cell DNA). In general, depressions in the levels of intracellular HBV DNA due to treatment with antiviral compounds are less pronounced, and occur more slowly, than depressions in the levels of HBV virion DNA (Korba and Milman, 1991, Antiviral Res., 15:217).</p><p>The manner in which the hybridization analyses were performed for these experiments resulted in an equivalence of approximately 1.0 pg of intracellular HBV DNA to 2-3 genomic copies per cell and 1.0 pg/ml of extracellular HBV DNA to 3</p><p>Toxicity Analysis</p><p>Toxicity analyses were performed to assess whether any observed antiviral effects were due to a general effect on cell viability. The method used herein was the measurement of the uptake of neutral red dye, a standard and widely used assay for cell viability in a variety of virus-host systems, including HSV and HIV. Toxicity analyses were performed in 96-well flat bottomed tissue culture plates.</p><p>Cells for the toxicity analyses were cultured and treated with test compounds with the same schedule as described for the antiviral evaluations below. Each compound was tested at 4 concentrations, each in triplicate cultures (wells "A", "B", and "C"). Uptake of neutral red dye was used to determine the relative level of toxicity. The absorbance of internalized dye at 510 nm (A.sub.sin) was used for the quantitative analysis. Values are presented as a percentage of the average A.sub.sin values in 9 separate cultures of untreated cells maintained on the same 96-well plate as the test compounds. Dye uptake in the 9 control cultures on plate 5 ranged from 91.6% to 110.4%, and on plate 6 from 96.6% to 109%.

Preparation of Pharmaceutical Compositions.</p><p>Humans suffering from diseases caused by HIV or HBV infection can be treated by administering to the patient an effective amount of (.+-.)-FTC, or its (-) or (+) enantiomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or salt thereof in the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The active materials can be administered by any appropriate route, for example, orally, parenterally, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, or topically, in liquid or solid form.</p><p>The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in an amount sufficient to deliver to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of compound to inhibit viral replication in vivo, especially HIV and HBV replication, without causing serious toxic effects in the patient treated. By "inhibitory amount" is meant an amount of active ingredient sufficient to exert an inhibitory effect as measured by, for example, an assay such as the ones described herein.</p><p>A preferred dose of (-), (+), or (.+-.)-FTC-for all of the above-mentioned conditions will be in the range from about 1 to 50 mg/kg, preferably 1 to 20 mg/kg, of body weight per day, more generally 0.1 to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. The effective dosage range of the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives can be calculated based on the weight of the parent nucleoside to be delivered. If the derivative exhibits activity in itself, the effective dosage can be estimated as above using the weight of the derivative, or by other means known to those skilled in the art.</p><p>The compound is conveniently administered in unit any suitable dosage form, including but not limited to one containing 7 to 3000 mg, preferably 70 to 1400 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. A oral dosage of 50-1000 mg is usually convenient.</p><p>Ideally the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 0.2 to 70 μM, preferably about 1.0 to 10 μM. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.1 to 5% solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or administered as a bolus of the active ingredient.</p><p>The concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time.</p><p>A preferred mode of administration of the active compound is oral. Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition.</p><p>The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar, shellac, or other enteric agents.</p><p>(.+-.)-FTC, or its (-) or (+)-enantiomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors.</p><p>(.+-.)-FTC, or its (-) or (+)-enantiomers, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or salts thereof can also be mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antibiotics, antifungals, antiinflammatories, or other antivirals, including other nucleoside anti-HIV compounds.</p><p>Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The parental preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</p><p>If administered intravenously, preferred carriers are physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS).</p><p>In a preferred embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</p><p>Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) are also preferred as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, liposome formulations may be prepared by dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, stearoyl phosphatidyl choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol) in an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the active compound or its monophosphate, diphosphate, and/or triphosphate derivatives are then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension.</p><p>IV. Preparation of Phosphate Derivatives of FTC</p><p>Mono, di, and triphosphate derivative of FTC can be prepared as described below.</p><p>The monophosphate can be prepared according to the procedure of Imai et al., J. Org. Chem., 34(6), 1547-1550 (June 1969). For example, about 100 mg of FTC and about 280 μl of phosphoryl chloride are reacted with stirring in about 8 ml of dry ethyl acetate at about 0 about four hours. The reaction is quenched with ice. The aqueous phase is purified on an activated charcoal column, eluting with 5% ammonium hydroxide in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and water. Evaporation of the eluant gives ammonium FTC-5'-monophosphate.</p><p>The diphosphate can be prepared according to the procedure of Davisson et al., J. Org. Chem., 52(9), 1794-1801 (1987). FTC diphosphate can be prepared from the corresponding tosylate, that can be prepared, for example, by reacting the nucleoside with tosyl chloride in pyridine at room temperature for about 24 hours, working up the product in the usual manner (e.g., by washing, drying, and crystallizing it).</p><p>The triphosphate can be prepared according to the procedure of Hoard et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87(8), 1785-1788 (1965). For FTC is activated (by making a imidazolide, according to methods known to those skilled in the art) and treating with tributyl ammonium pyrophosphate in DMF. The reaction gives primarily the triphosphate of the nucleoside, with some unreacted monophosphate and some diphosphate. Purification by anion exchange chromatography of a DEAE column is followed by isolation of the triphosphate, e.g., as the tetrasodium salt.</p><p>This invention has been described with reference to its preferred embodiments. Variations and modifications of the invention, will be obvious to those skilled in the art from the foregoing detailed description of the invention. It is intended that all of these variations and modifications be included within the scope of the appended claims.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>We claim:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
