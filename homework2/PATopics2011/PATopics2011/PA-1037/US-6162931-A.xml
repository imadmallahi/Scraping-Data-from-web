Additionally a facile synthesis for fluorinated resorcinols and aminophenols is provided.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Fluorescent dyes are known to be particularly suitable for biological applications in which a highly sensitive detection reagent is desirable. Fluorescent dyes are used to impart both visible color and fluorescence to other materials.</p><p>The dyes of this invention are fluorine-substituted analogs of xanthene-based dyes that are typically fluorescein or rhodol derivatives. Fluoresceins and rhodols are known to strongly absorb visible light and, in most cases, to be highly fluorescent. Polychlorinated, polybrominated and polyiodinated analogs of fluorescein dyes are known to shift the spectrum to longer-wavelengths than the unsubstituted dyes. Polybrominated and polyiodinated analogs of fluorescein dyes have much lower fluorescence yields, higher phosphorescence yields and are effective photosensitizers of certain chemical reactions. The preparation and use of reactive rhodol dyes and their conjugates was disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,227,487 (1993) and 5,442,045 (1995) to Haugland et al. (each incorporated by reference). Both fluorescein and rhodol are considered "xanthene" dyes. That is, they are characterized by structural similarity to, or derivation from, xanthene. ##STR1##</p><p>"Fluorescein" dyes include derivatives of 3H-xanthen-6-ol-3-one that are substituted at the 9-position by a 2-carboxyphenyl group, while "rhodol dyes" include derivatives of 6-amino-3H-xanthen-3-one that are substituted at the 9-position by a 2-carboxyphenyl group. ##STR2##</p><p>When substituted at the 1-position by a derivative capable of forming a 5- or 6-membered lactone or lactam ring alternative structures for fluorescein and rhodol dyes are possible: ##STR3##</p><p>Despite their widespread use in biological assays, fluorescein-based dyes have certain well-known deficiencies. In particular, it is widely recognized that fluorescein conjugates are unstable with respect to the intense illumination produced in most fluorescence instrumentation. The result is irreversible photobleaching, which typically results in a rapid decrease in fluorescent signal. In a fluorescence microscope the amount of irreversible bleaching may reach essentially 100% in less than one minute. This susceptibility to photobleaching considerably reduces the utility of fluorescein fluorophores for quantitative assays. A second problem of fluorescein is that its pK.sub.a (acid dissociation constant) is approximately 6.4 in water (see FIG. 3), making its absorbance and fluorescence properties quite pH dependent in the physiological pH range, so much so that certain fluoresceins are utilized as fluorescent pH indicators (for example BCECF, Rink et al. J. CELL BIOL. 95, 189 (1982)). This pH sensitivity also reduces the utility of fluoresceins for quantitative assays (See FIG. 3). A third difficulty that is recognized when using fluorescein dyes is the tendency of fluorescein conjugates to exhibit fluorescence that is highly quenched relative to that of the free fluorophore. This typically quickly leads to protein conjugates of fluorescein exhibiting less fluorescence even when more dye molecules are conjugated to the protein (see FIG. 1), reducing the sensitivity that is possible for assays using fluorescein conjugates. A highly desirable class of fluorophores would retain the favorable characteristics of fluorescein, including generally high absorbance and fluorescence of fluorescein, the ability to be excited using the 488-nm line of the argon-ion laser, and the ability to use standard optical filters for fluorescein that are already available for most fluorescence microscopes, while simultaneously possessing characteristics that improve on the deficiencies of fluorescein.</p><p>Fluorination of fluorescein-like dyes simultaneously improves all three of these known deficiencies of fluorescein dyes, while generally retaining the other desirable spectral properties of fluorescein-like dyes. In particular, fluorinated analogs of fluorescein are typically more photostable than the corresponding nonfluorinated analogs. In addition, the conjugates of fluorinated fluorescein dyes typically exhibit higher fluorescence than those of nonfluorinated dyes. In some cases the fluorescence of the protein conjugates of the fluorinated dyes is not quenched at degrees of substitution that strongly quench the fluorescence of conjugates of the corresponding nonfluorinated dyes (for example, see FIG. 1). The pK.sub.a of the fluorinated dyes is significantly lower than that of the nonfluorinated analogs (&amp;gt;1.5 pH units on the otherwise unsubstituted dyes, see FIG. 3). Furthermore, we found that fluorination of fluoresceins at the 2'- and 7'-positions unexpectedly had virtually no effect on either the absorption spectrum, the fluorescence spectrum or the quantum yield of the dye relative to the nonfluorinated versions, and additionally, the conjugates of these fluorinated fluoresceins tend to be more fluorescent than the nonfluorinated versions (for example, see FIG. 1) making these dyes preferred substitutes for fluoresceins. All other reported substitutions at the 2'- and 7'-positions of fluorescein, including halogenation with Cl, Br or I, have been reported to shift the spectra of the dye toward longer wavelengths.</p><p>Additionally, fluorescein analogs that are polyfluorinated on the phenyl substituent that is typically present in most fluorescein and rhodol dyes are subject to nucleophilic displacement reactions, providing a novel route to reactive derivatives and conjugates. Certain types of the fluorinated xanthenes unexpectedly give products that are well-retained in live biological cells. This reactivity is not observed with the nonfluorinated xanthenes.</p><p>In addition to the fluorinated dyes of the invention, we hereby also provided a means to prepare derivatives of fluorescein that are substituted at the 1'- and/or 8'-positions; molecules that do not appear to have been previously described.</p><p>Analogs of fluorescein dyes with fluorine atoms substituted onto the xanthene portion of the dye have been generically included as claimed embodiments in various patents describe, typically by claiming "halogens" as permitted substituents on the dye. However these patents do not describe either the highly advantageous properties of these fluorinated fluorophores and their conjugates, and typically require other structural limitations not required by the present invention. In particular these patents do not describe the lack of spectral shift and enhanced photostability that typifies several of the dyes of the current invention. Also, these patents do not require that the dye be substituted by at least one fluorine atom. Furthermore, these patents fail to describe methods that are suitable for synthesis of the dyes the invention, as the unique chemistry of fluorine in organic chemistry does not permit utilization of the methods that are typically used to prepare chlorine, bromine or iodine substituted fluorescein derivatives. While halogenated rhodol dyes have been described previously (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,227,487 (1993) and 5,442,045 (1995) to Haugland et al., the properties and syntheses of fluorinated analogs of rhodol dyes have not previously been described. In particular, efficient methods for preparing the requisite fluororesorcinols and fluoroaminophenols have not previously been described. It was found that a more facile method of preparing these intermediates was required in order to efficiently prepare the wide variety of dyes described herein.</p><p>The preparation and use of fluorescein dyes and conjugates of fluorescein dyes is already well-known in the art, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,213,904 to Haugland et al. (1980), U.S. Pat. No. 3,996,345 to Ullman et al. (1976), U.S. Pat. No. 4,199,559 to Ullman et al. (1980)), U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,803 to Mattingly (1993), U.S. Pat. No. 4,420,568 to Wang et al. (1983), U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,666 to Prober et al. (1994), U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,928 to Hobbs (1991), U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,356 to Khanna et al. (1984), U.S. Pat. No. 4,510,251 to Kirkemo et al. (1985), U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,740 to Rotman (1986), U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,846 to Khanna et al. (1982), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,343 to Neckers et al. (1995), all of which are incorporated by reference, and International Publication No. WO 94/05688 by Menchen et al. (1994).</p><p>We have demonstrated the use of the fluorinated dyes for the preparation of a wide variety of reactive derivatives that utilize chemistry mostly analogous to that used to prepare known reactive fluorescein and rhodol dyes. We have also demonstrated a heretofor unknown reactivity toward nucleophilic displacement possessed by fluorinated dye derivatives that are fluorinated on the 9-aryl portion of the dyes. We have further demonstrated that the improved properties of the fluorinated dyes are retained in their conjugates and that these conjugates have properties that are typically superior to those prepared from the corresponding nonfluorinated dyes. The dyes of the invention are suitable for substitution for fluoresceins and rhodols in all their known applications except those requiring sensitivity to pH changes near pH 7.</p><p>For the practical preparation of the fluorinated dyes it was necessary to develop a novel general synthesis of fluorinated resorcinol and aminophenol derivatives that would yield isomer-free products in good yield. Previous methods give low yields of products that usually consist of difficult-to-separate isomer mixtures and require the use of generally obnoxious fluorinating agents. Our novel method uses generally available precursors and standard laboratory reagents and equipment to reproducibly produce these essential precursors in relatively large quantities.</p><p>It is an object of this invention to provide novel and advantageous fluorinated fluorescein and rhodol dyes suitable for use as tracers, labels or synthetic intermediates. It is an additional object of this invention to provide reactive derivatives of fluorinated fluorescein and rhodol dyes useful for the preparation of fluorescent dye-conjugates. It is yet another object of this invention to provide usefully labeled dye-conjugates of fluorinated fluorescein and rhodol dyes that possess the novel and advantageous properties of the novel dyes. It is a further object of the invention to provide versions of fluorinated fluorophores that are useful for detecting enzymes, particularly within live cells and cellular organelles. It is also an object of the invention to provide a novel synthesis of fluorinated resorcinols and aminophenols, greatly simplifying the preparation of the fluorinated fluorescein and rhodol dyes of the invention.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1: A comparison of relative fluorescence as a function of the number of fluorophores attached per protein for goat anti-mouse IgG conjugates, as described in Example 112, prepared using 9-(4-carboxy-2-sulfophenyl)-2,7-difluoro-6-hydroxy-3H-xanthen-3-ol-6-one, succinimidyl ester (.tangle-solidup.), 6-carboxymethylthio-2',4,5,7,7'-pentafluorofluorescein, succinimidyl ester (Compound 64) (.box-solid.), 6-carboxy-2',7'-difluorofluorescein, succinimidyl ester (Compound 61) (.circle-solid.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, □).

In another embodiment of the invention, R.sup.12 is a carboxy or a sulfo, and none of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 or R.sup.16 is F. In yet another embodiment, three of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 are F, and R.sup.12 is a carboxy or a sulfo.</p><p>In another embodiment of the invention, the dyes have the formula ##STR6##</p><p>The ring substituents R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5 and R.sup.6 are as defined previously.</p><p>Substituent A is independently OR.sup.7 or NR.sup.8 R.sup.9, where R.sup.7, R.sup.8 and R.sup.9 are as defined previously.</p><p>R.sup.10 is as defined previously.

Dyes that incorporate a spirosultone ring may exist in equilibrium with the isomer wherein R.sup.12 is a sulfonic acid, or R.sup.10 is a sulfonic acid-substituted ethyl or propyl. Isomers that incorporate a spirolactone or spirosultone ring are non-fluorescent until the ring is opened.</p><p>Where A is OR.sup.7, R.sup.10 is aryl and R.sup.12 is carboxy, the described dye is a fluorescein (Formula I) or a dihydrofluorescein (Formula II). Where A is NR.sup.8 R.sup.9, R.sup.10 is aryl and R.sup.12 is carboxy, the described dye is a rhodol (Formula I) or a dihydrorhodol (Formula II).</p><p>The fluorinated xanthenes described thus far are optionally modified to possess a reactive group that is bound directly to the fluorophore by a single bond or by a linking moiety. Such a reactive dye may be used to prepare a dye-conjugate (as described below). The dyes are optionally substituted by an R.sup.7 substituent that modifies the spectral properties of the dye, that makes the dye a substrate for an enzyme, makes the dye more cell-permeant, or makes the dye photoactivatible.</p><p>For all embodiments of the invention, at least one of the dye substituents R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, R.sup.6, R.sup.10, R.sup.12, R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 or R.sup.16 is required to be a covalently bound fluorine (F).</p><p>In one embodiment, one or more of R.sup.1, R.sup.2 R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5 and R.sup.6 is F. In an additional embodiment, where at least one of R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4 and R.sup.5 is F, none of R.sup.12, R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 is F. In yet another embodiment, where at least one of R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4 and R.sup.5 is F, at least one of R.sup.12, R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 is F. In another embodiment at least one of the substituents (other than R.sup.3 and R.sup.4) is F.</p><p>Typically, where A=OR.sup.7, either R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are each F, or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are each F, or all of R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4 and R.sup.5. Where A=OR.sup.7, fluorination at R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 alone is preferred over fluorination at R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 alone because, inter alia, fluorination at R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 alone results in improved and greater photostability, lower pKa, higher quantum yield, and greater degree of substitution on polymers without quenching of fluorescence, relative to fluorescein, while maintaining substantially identical wavelengths of maximum absorption and emission. Fluorination at R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 alone, in contrast, results in improved photostability and a lower pKa relative to fluorescein, but with a lower quantum yield, no increase in useful degree of substitution and a shift in maximal absorption wavelength of about 20 nm, relative to carboxyfluorescein. Fluorination at each of R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 and R.sup.5, however, improves the photostability and lowers the pKa relative to either pair of fluorine substituents; but still shifts the absorption peak, shows no increase in useful degrees of substitution, and results in a lower quantum yield, relative to fluorescein.</p><p>Where A=NR.sup.8 R.sup.9, preferably R.sup.5 is F, resulting in a drop in the pKa of the dye relative to the non-fluorinated analog. Where R.sup.2 is F, the pKa is comparable to that of the non-fluorinated compound; with both groups of compounds having comparable wavelengths of maximal absorption and emission relative to non-fluorinated compounds.</p><p>In another embodiment, at least one of R.sup.12, R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 is F. In one embodiment, four of R.sup.12, R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 is F. In another embodiment, each of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 is F. In another embodiment, where at least one of R.sup.12, R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 is F, none of R.sup.1, R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5 and R.sup.6 is F. For both A=NR.sup.8 R.sup.9 and A=OR.sup.7, where each of R.sup.13 through R.sup.16 is fluorinated, the resulting dyes react readily with nucleophiles, and where in addition R.sup.11 and R.sup.12, taken in combination, are spirolactone, the resulting dyes are well retained in cells or attach readily to biological molecules, relative to the non-fluorinated analogs. Dye conjugates of these polyfluorinated dyes exhibit increased fluorescence, and achieve higher degrees of fluorophore substitution before fluorescence quenching begins to occur. The dyes also possess increased photostability relative to non-fluorinated analogs. Where both the pendent aryl and xanthene rings are fluorinated, the photostability of the dye increases and its pKa decreases, relative to less-fluorinated and non-fluorinated compounds. In addition, where A=OR.sup.7, the wavelength of maximum absorption shifts and the pKa and quantum yield are slightly lower than that of fluorescein.</p><p>In yet another embodiment of the invention, R.sup.1 and R.sup.6 are H, and R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, and R.sup.5 are H, F, Cl, Br or I, provided that at least one of the substituents is F, as permitted.

In certain embodiments (see, for example Examples 64 and 73) the reactive group R.sub.x is attached to the dye by multiple intervening atoms that serve as a spacer to separate the resulting conjugated substance from the dye itself. Such separation frequently improves the properties of conjugates by reducing quenching of the dye's fluorescence, by removing the large dye from a site required for use of the conjugate in an enzymatic reaction or by reducing the effect of the dye on binding of a labeled ligand to its receptor. This covalent linkage, L, is also useful in improving the accessibility of the dye to an antibody that binds to the dye.</p><p>The covalent linkage L is optionally a single covalent bond, such that the reactive group R.sub.x is bound directly to the fluorophore at any of R.sup.2 -R.sup.5 or R.sup.7 -R.sup.16, preferably at one of R.sup.13 -R.sup.16, more preferably at R.sup.14 or R.sup.15, or is present as a substituent on an alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio or alkylamino substituent. The linkage L is typically selected so as to link the dye to the reactive group R.sub.x with stable chemical bonds, typically including carbon-carbon bonds, carbon-nitrogen bonds, nitrogen-nitrogen bonds, carbon-oxygen bonds and carbon-sulfur bonds. In addition to single, double, triple or aromatic carbon-carbon bonds, L typically includes ether, thioether, carboxamide, sulfonamide, urea, urethane or hydrazine functional moieties. Preferred L moieties have 1-20 nonhydrogen atoms selected from the group consisting of C, N, O and S. These preferred L moieties are composed of any combination of chemical bonds, including ether, thioether, amine, ester, carboxamide, sulfonamide, hydrazide bonds and aromatic or heteroaromatic bonds. Preferred L moieties are composed of any combination of single carbon-carbon bonds and carboxamide or thioether bonds. The longest linear segment of the linkage L preferably contains 4-10 nonhydrogen atoms including one or two heteroatoms.</p><p>Specific examples of L optionally include substituted or unsubstituted polymethylene, arylene, alkylarylene or arylenealkyl. In one embodiment of the invention, L contains 1-6 carbon atoms. In another embodiment of the invention, L is a single covalent bond. In yet another embodiment of the invention, L has the formula --(CH.sub.2).sub.a (CONH(CH.sub.2).sub.b).sub.z --, where a has any value from 0-5, b has any value from 1-5 and z is 0 or 1. In yet another embodiment of the invention, L is a thioether linkage.</p><p>The dyes of the invention that contain a reactive group, R.sub.x, possess particular utility for the attachment of the fluorinated fluorophore to desired substances. The desired substances are typically organic substances but may also be inorganic substances such as glass or silicon derivatives. The reactive dyes of the invention fluorescently label a wide variety of substances, provided that the substance to be labeled contains a functional group that possesses suitable reactivity with at least one reactive group (R.sub.x) on the dye. Typically, the reactive group is selected to possess suitable reactivity with a functional group already on the substance to be derivatized. The reactive group and functional group are typically an electrophile and a nucleophile that readily react to generate a covalent linkage. Typically, but not exclusively, the reactive group on the fluorophore is an electrophile, and the functional group on the substance to be derivatized is a nucleophile. Alternatively, the reactive group is a photoactivatable group, such as an azide, diazirinyl or azidoaryl derivative, and becomes chemically reactive only after illumination with light of an appropriate wavelength.</p><p>Generally, amines, thiols, and alcohols are the preferred nucleophilic functional groups for conjugation, as they are both more reactive and more commonly available for the modification of biomolecules. However, a wide variety of other functional groups, including carboxylic acids, aldehydes and ketones, react under conditions well understood by one skilled in the art. Selected examples of functional groups and linkages are shown in Table 2, where the reaction of an electrophilic group and a nucleophilic group yields a covalent linkage. The specific covalent linkage that attaches the fluorinated fluorophore to the conjugated substance typically depends on the functional group that is naturally present on the substance to be conjugated or is present as a result of derivatization of the substance to be conjugated according to methods generally known in the art. The functional group on the organic substance may be attached directly, or attached via any useful spacer or linker as defined below. A dye-conjugate is prepared from either a readily-available organic or inorganic substance, or from an initially non-reactive organic or inorganic substance that has been derivatized by an appropriate functional group.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 2______________________________________Examples of some routes to useful covalent linkagesElectrophilic Group       Nucleophilic Group                    Resulting Covalent Linkage______________________________________activated esters*       amines/anilines                    carboxamidesacyl azides**       amines/anilines                    carboxamidesacyl halides       amines/anilines                    carboxamidesacyl halides       alcohols/phenols                    estersacyl nitriles       alcohols/phenols                    estersacyl nitriles       amines/anilines                    carboxamidesaldehydes   amines/anilines                    iminesaldehydes or ketones       hydrazines   hydrazonesaldehydes or ketones       hydroxylamines                    oximesalkyl halides       amines/anilines                    alkyl aminesalkyl halides       carboxylic acids                    estersalkyl halides       thiols       thioethersalkyl halides       alcohols/phenols                    ethersalkyl sulfonates       thiols       thioethersalkyl sulfonates       carboxylic acids                    estersalkyl sulfonates       alcohols/phenols                    ethersanhydrides  alcohols/phenols                    estersanhydrides  amines/anilines                    carboxamidesaryl halides       thiols       thiophenolsaryl halides       amines       aryl aminesazindines   thiols       thioethersboronates   glycols      boronate esterscarboxylic acids       amines/anilines                    carboxamidescarboxylic acids       alcohols     esterscarboxylic acids       hydrazines   hydrazidescarbodiimides       carboxylic acids                    N-acylureas or anhydridesdiazoalkanes       carboxylic acids                    estersepoxides    thiols       thioethershaloacetamides       thiols       thioethershalotriazines       amines/anilines                    ammotriazineshalotriazines       alcohols/phenols                    triazinyl ethersimido esters       amines/anilines                    amidinesisocyanates amines/anilines                    ureasisocyanates alcohols/phenols                    urethanesisothiocyanates       amines/anilines                    thioureasmaleimides  thiols       thioethersphosphoramidites       alcohols     phosphite esterssilyl halides       alcohols     silyl etherssulfonate esters       amines/anilines                    alkyl aminessulfonate esters       thiols       thioetherssulfonate esters       carboxylic acids                    esterssulfonate esters       alcohols     etherssulfonyl halides       amines/anilines                    sulfonamidessulfonyl halides       phenols/alcohols                    sulfonate esters______________________________________ *Activated esters, as understood in the art, generally have the formula --COΩ, where Ω is a good leaving group (e.g. oxysuccinimidyl (--OC.sub.4 H.sub.4 O.sub.2) oxysulfosuccinimidyl (--OC.sub.4 H.sub.3 O.sub.2 --SO.sub.3 H), 1-oxybenzotriazolyl (--OC.sub.6 H.sub.4 N.sub.3); or an aryloxy group or aryloxy substituted one or more times by electron withdrawing substituents such as nitro,  # fluoro, chloro, cyano, or trifluoromethyl, or combinations thereof, used to form activated aryl esters; or a carboxylic acid activated by a carbodiimide to form an anhydride or mixed anhydride --OCOR.sup.a or --OCNR.sup.a NHR.sup.b, wher R.sup.a and R.sup.b, which may be the same or different, are C.sub.1C.sub.6 alkyl, C.sub.1C.sub.6 perfluoroalkyl, or C.sub.1C.sub.6 alkoxy; or cyctohexyl, 3dimethylaminopropyl, or Nmorpholinoethyl). **Acyl azides can also rearrange to isocyanates</pre></p><p>The types of functional groups typically present on the organic or inorganic substance to be conjugated include, but are not limited to, amines, thiols, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, phosphates, imidazoles, hydrazines, hydroxylamines, disubstituted amines, halides, epoxides, sulfonate esters, purines, pyrimidines, carboxylic acids, or a combination of these groups. Amines, thiols, and alcohols are the preferred functional groups for conjugation, as they are both more reactive and more commonly available for the modification of biomolecules.</p><p>Other types of reactions that are useful for preparing dye-conjugates, especially of polymers, include catalyzed polymerizations or copolymerizations of alkenes and reactions of dienes with dienophiles, transesterifications or transaminations.</p><p>Dyes that are selected to conjugate with substances or materials having free amine groups are typically those dyes of the invention wherein R.sub.x is a carboxylic acid, a derivative of a carboxylic acid, or an activated ester of a carboxylic acid, preferably a succinimidyl or sulfosuccinimidyl ester. Amine-reactive dyes are of particular relevance as they are commonly used to label proteins and polypeptides, which possess free amine groups. Amine-reactive dyes are additionally used to label materials that have been substituted with free amine groups, such as amino-dextrans, or amine containing nucleotides, oligonucleotides, nucleic acids, amine-derivatized polymers or glasses, or amine-containing haptens.</p><p>Dyes that are selected to conjugate with materials having free thiol groups are preferably those dyes of the invention wherein R.sub.x is a haloalkyl, haloacetamide, halomethylbenzamide, a maleimido group, an epoxide or a sulfonate ester, wherein the sulfonic acid is an alkylsulfonic acid, perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid or an arylsulfonic acid. More preferably, the R.sub.x is an iodoacetamide, maleimido or a halomethylbenzamide. Additionally, the dyes of the invention where at least one of R.sup.13 -R.sup.16 is fluorine react spontaneously with certain nucleophiles, including thiols, to yield stable dye-conjugates. Preferably such dyes are of Formula II, where A is OR.sup.7, R.sup.7 is a BLOCK, and R.sup.10 and R.sup.12, when taken in combination, form a spirolactone ring or spirosultone ring, wherein 1-4 of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 and R.sup.16 is F.</p><p>Preferred alcohol- and phenol-reactive dyes are those dyes of the invention wherein R.sub.x is an isocyanate, a 3,5-dichloro-2,4,6-triazine, an acyl nitrile or a phosphoramidite.</p><p>Where dye-conjugates are prepared using a photoreactive dye of the invention, (wherein R.sub.x is an azide, diazirinyl or azidoaryl derivative), the conjugation reaction requires illumination of the reactive dye by light having a suitable wavelength, typically &amp;lt;400 nm.

Where a single fluorinated fluorophore is covalently conjugated to a substance, the conjugated substance is typically represented by --L--S.sub.c, where S.sub.c is the conjugated substance itself, and --L-- is a covalent linkage attaching the conjugated substance to the fluorinated fluorophore, as described previously.</p><p>Any organic or inorganic substance that contains an appropriate functional group with suitable cross-reactivity may be conjugated with a dye of the present invention. A conjugated substance may be conjugated to more than one fluorophore, which may be the same or different, or to a substance that is additionally modified by a hapten, such as biotin or digoxigenin. The preparation of conjugates of fluorescein and rhodol dyes is well-known in the art (Haugland et al., MOLECULAR PROBES HANDBOOK OF FLUORESCENT PROBES AND RESEARCH CHEMICALS, (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,442,045 to Haugland et al. (1995), incorporated by reference). However, the preparation of conjugates of the fluorinated fluorophores of the present invention impart the highly advantageous properties of the novel fluorinated fluorophores onto the resulting dye-conjugate.</p><p>Useful dye-conjugates of the present invention include conjugates of antigens, steroids, vitamins, drugs, haptens, metabolites, toxins, environmental pollutants, amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, nucleic acid polymers, carbohydrates, lipids, ion-complexing moieties, polymers, or cells or cellular components.</p><p>In one embodiment of the invention, the conjugated substance (S.sub.c) is an amino acid, protected amino acid, peptide, or protein. By amino acid is meant any of the natural amino acids or their optical isomers, as well as synthetic variations commonly known and utilized in the art. Common synthetic variations include amino acids that are protected on their amino, carboxylic acid, hydroxy, thiol, imidazole or other functional group. Other modified amino acids may be substituted by phosphate, or through glycosylation or acylation with a C.sub.1 to C.sub.22 carboxylic acid. Both peptides and proteins fall under the general category of peptides. While the specific demarcation line between peptides and proteins is not exact, it is typically recognized in the art that peptides have molecular weights of less than about 5,000 to 10,000 daltons, and proteins have molecular weights greater than about 5,000 to 10,000 daltons. Proteins typically possess at least secondary structure, and most often tertiary and quaternary structure.</p><p>Although peptides include molecules as small as dipeptides, where S.sub.c is a peptide, it is preferred that the peptide contain at least five amino acids, more preferably 5 to 36 amino acids. Preferred peptides to be conjugated to the dyes of the invention include, but are not limited to, neuropeptides, chemotactic peptides, cytokines (such as lymphokines), gastrointestinal peptides, toxins, protease substrates, synthetic peptides, experimental peptides, endothelin and protein kinase substrates. Dye-peptide conjugates of this invention include those labeled with at least one dye of the present invention in combination with a second fluorescent or nonfluorescent dye to form an energy transfer pair, or to a hapten such as biotin or digoxigenin, or to a reactive group R.sub.x.</p><p>The protein conjugates of the present invention encompass a variety of proteins, including but not limited to enzymes, antibodies, catalytic antibodies, kinases, lectins, glycoproteins, histones, albumins, lipoproteins, avidin, strepavidin, protein A, protein G, phycobiliproteins, hormones, toxins and growth factors. By enzyme is meant any of a group of molecules that are typically but not exclusively produced by living cells, that function as catalysts for biochemical reactions. Some enzymes require small organic molecular cofactors for their activity. Antibodies, as used herein, are any of various proteins synthesized by animals in response to the presence of a foreign substance, for example, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and its fragments, monoclonal antibodies, "humanized" antibodies and catalytic antibodies. A kinase is one of a number of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to another substrate, including polynucleotide kinase, protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Lectins, as used herein, are any of various proteins that selectively bind carbohydrates, such as cell surface carbohydrates, which can be used to identify cell type. Appropriate lectins are typically isolated from plants, preferably legumes, or from bacteria, fish or invertebrates. Preferred lectins are wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A. Glycoproteins, as used herein, are any of a class of conjugated proteins containing both carbohydrate and protein units. Lipoproteins, as used herein, are any class of conjugated proteins containing both lipid and protein units. Phycobiliproteins are any of several proteins isolated from algae, including but not limited to B-phycoerythrin, R-phycoerythrin, C-phycocyanine or allophycocyanin. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the conjugated substance is an antibody, an antibody fragment, avidin, streptavidin, α-bungarotoxin, epidermal growth factor or a phallotoxin.</p><p>In another embodiment of the invention, the conjugated substance (S.sub.c) is a single nucleic acid base, single nucleoside, single nucleotide or a nucleic acid polymer. By nucleotide is meant the basic structural unit of a nucleic acid, comprising an ester of a nucleoside and one or more phosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid groups, optionally containing an additional linker or spacer for attachment of a fluorophore or other ligand, such as an alkynyl linkage (U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,519 to Hobbs, Jr. et al., (1991), incorporated by reference), an aminoallyl linkage (U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,955 to Ward et al. (1987), incorporated by reference) or other linkage. Nucleotides, as used herein, include natural and synthetic derivatives, including deoxynucleotides, dideoxynucleotides, cyclonucleotides and abasic nucleotide analogs, wherein the base is replaced by a fluorophore or hapten. Preferably, the conjugated nucleotide is a mono-, di- or triphosphate ester of an adenosine, a guanosine, a uridine, a cytidine or a thymidine. More preferably, the conjugated nucleotide is a nucleoside triphosphate or a deoxynucleoside triphosphate or a dideoxynucleoside triphosphate.</p><p>Nucleic acid polymers are typically large, chainlike molecules containing phosphoric acid esters, sugars, and purine and pyrimidine bases. Polymers that are oligonucleotides are typically composed of fewer than 50 nucleotides, more typically composed of fewer than 25 nucleotides. Oligonucleotides are optionally deoxyribonucleic acid polymers (DNA) or ribonucleic acid polymers (RNA), or a hybrid thereof. Suitable oligonucleotides are optionally antisense oligonucleotides, or strands of DNA having a sequence identical to messenger RNA. DNA polymers are optionally single-stranded (ss), double-stranded (ds), triple-stranded or quadruple-stranded DNA. RNA is optionally single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid polymers. The nucleic acid polymer may be a natural polymer (biological in origin) or a synthetic polymer (modified or prepared artificially). The nucleic acid polymer optionally incorporates an unusual linker such as morpholine derivatized phosphates (AntiVirals, Inc., Corvallis Oreg.), or peptide nucleic acids such as N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units (Wittung, et al., NATURE 368, 561 (1994)). In one embodiment of the invention, the dye is attached to the nucleotide, oligonucleotide or nucleic acid polymer via one or more purine or pyrimidine bases through an amide, ester, ether or thioether bond. In another embodiment of the invention, the dye is attached to the phosphate or carbohydrate by a bond that is an ester, thioester, amide, ether or thioether. In another embodiment of the invention at least one dye of the invention is conjugated to an oligonucleotide that is simultaneously labeled with at least a second dye to form a fluorescence energy transfer pair (as described in Ju et al., PROC. NATL. ACAD. SCI. USA 92, 4347 (1955), or to a hapten such as biotin or digoxigenin, or to an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase, or to a protein such as an antibody.</p><p>In another embodiment of the invention, the conjugated substance (S.sub.c) is a carbohydrate. By carbohydrate is meant any of the group of organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and occasionally nitrogen or sulfur, that include sugars, starches and celluloses. In one embodiment the conjugated sugar is an α- or β-glycoside or an aminoglycoside antibiotic. The conjugated substance is optionally a polysaccharide, such as dextran, FICOL, heparin, glycogen, amylopectin, mannan, inulin, starch, agarose and cellulose. All of these polysaccharides are readily available at low cost, high purity, low background absorbance and fluorescence and have relatively uniform physical properties. Where the conjugated substance is a polysaccharide, preferably the polysaccharide conjugate is a dextran or FICOL conjugate, more preferably a dextran conjugate.</p><p>In another embodiment of the invention, the conjugated substance (S.sub.c), is a lipid. By lipid is meant one of a class of compounds that contains long-chain saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons (typically having 6-25 carbons) and their derivatives, such as fatty acids, alcohols, amines, amino alcohols, and aldehydes. The class of lipids include glycolipids, phospholipids and sphingolipids. Glycolipids are lipids that additionally contain carbohydrate units. Phospholipids are lipids containing esters of phosphoric acid containing one or two molecules of fatty acid or fatty alkyl ethers, an alcohol, and generally a nitrogenous base. Sphingolipids are lipids, such as sphingomyelin, that yield sphingosine or one of its derivatives as a product of hydrolysis. Alternatively, the conjugated substance is a lipid vesicle, such as a liposome or lipoprotein (as in Examples 121 and 122).</p><p>The conjugated substance is optionally an ion-complexing moiety. While any chelator that binds an ion of interest and gives a change in its fluorescence properties is a suitable conjugate, preferred ion-complexing moieties are crown ether, including diaryldiaza crown ethers, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,975 to Kuhn et al. (1995); derivatives of 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxyethane)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (Examples 103-105 and Example 104), as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,517 to Kuhn et al. (1995) (incorporated by reference) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,673 to Tsien et al. (1991); derivatives of 2-carboxymethoxy-aniline-N,N-diacetic acid (APTRA), as described by Ragu et al. AM. J. PHYSIOL. 256, C540 (1989); and pyridyl-based and phenanthroline metal ion chelators (Example 106), as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,270 to Kuhn et al. (1997) (incorporated by reference). Preferably the conjugated ion-complexing moiety is a diaryldiaza crown ether chelator or a BAPTA chelator. Fluorescent conjugates of ion-complexing moieties possess utility as indicators for the presence of a desired metal ion. While fluorescent ion-indicators are known in the art the incorporation of the fluorinated fluorophores of the present invention imparts the highly advantageous properties of the instant fluorophores onto the resulting ion indicator. In particular, the lower pK.sub.a of the dyes of the invention result in less sensitivity of the fluorescence of the ion indicator to changes in intracellular pH and the reduced photobleaching properties improves the ability to quantitate the fluorescence response of the indicator. Furthermore, conjugates based on 2',7'-difluorofluorescein are better excited by the 488-nm excitation line of the argon-ion laser than are the conjugates of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein that were described by Tsien et al. (1991) (supra). These ion-sensing conjugates are optionally prepared in chemically reactive forms and further conjugated to polymers such as dextrans to improve their utility as sensors as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,405,975 and 5,453,517 (supra).</p><p>Alternatively, the conjugates of the present invention are conjugates of cells, cellular systems, cellular fragments, or subcellular particles. Examples of this type of conjugated material include virus particles, bacterial particles, virus components, biological cells (such as animal cells, plant cells, bacteria, or yeast), or cellular components. Examples of cellular components that can be labeled, or whose constituent molecules can be labeled, include but are not limited to lysosomes, endosomes, cytoplasm, nuclei, histones, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles.</p><p>Finally, the conjugates of the present invention are optionally dye-conjugates of polymers, polymeric particles, polymeric microparticles including magnetic and non-magnetic microspheres, polymeric membranes, conducting and non-conducting metals and non-metals, and glass and plastic surfaces and particles. Conjugates are optionally prepared by copolymerization of a fluorinated dye that contains an appropirate functionality while preparing the polymer, or by chemical modification of a polymer that contains functional groups with suitable chemical reactivity. In another embodiment of the invention, the conjugated substance is a glass or silica, which may be formed into an optical fiber or other structure.</p><p>In one embodiment of the invention, exactly one of R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, R.sup.7, R.sup.9, R.sup.10, R.sup.11, R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15 or R.sup.16 is a --L--S.sub.c moiety. In another embodiment of the invention, exactly one of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15, or R.sup.16 is an --L--S.sub.c moiety. Where exactly one of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15, or R.sup.16 is an --L--S.sub.c moiety, typically either each of the remaining of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15, or R.sup.16 is fluorine, or each of the remaining of R.sup.13, R.sup.14, R.sup.15, or R.sup.16 is hydrogen.</p><p>Preferably the conjugated substance is an amino acid, peptide protein, polysaccharide, ion-complexing moiety, nucleotide, oligonucleotide, nucleic acid, hapten, drug, lipid, phospholipid, lipoprotein, lipopolysaccharide, liposome, lipophilic polymer, polymer, polymeric microparticle, animal cell, plant cell, bacterium, yeast or virus.</p><p>Preparation of Dye-Conjugates</p><p>Conjugates of most low molecular weight drugs, peptides, toxins, nucleotides, phospholipids and other organic molecules are prepared by organic synthesis methods using the reactive dyes of the invention, by means well recognized in the art (Haugland, MOLECULAR PROBES HANDBOOK, supra, Sets 1-7, (1992)). Preferably, conjugation to form a covalent bond consists of simply mixing the reactive dyes of the present invention in a suitable solvent in which both the reactive dye and the substance to be conjugated are soluble. The reaction preferably proceeds spontaneously without added reagents at room temperature or below. For those reactive dyes that are photoactivated, conjugation requires illumination of the reaction mixture to activate the reactive dye. Chemical modification of water-insoluble substances, so that a desired dye-conjugate may be prepared, is preferably performed in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, ethyl acetate, toluene, or chloroform. Similar modification of water-soluble materials is readily accomplished through the use of the instant reactive dyes to make them more readily soluble in organic solvents. Many of the dyes of the present invention are readily dissolved in aqueous solution by adjusting the pH of the solution to about 6 or higher.</p><p>Preparation of peptide or protein conjugates typically comprises first dissolving the protein to be conjugated in aqueous buffer at ˜1-10 mg/mL at room temperature or below. Bicarbonate buffers pH ˜8.3 are especially suitable for reaction with succinimidyl esters, phosphate buffers pH ˜7.2-8 for reaction with thiol-reactive functional groups and carbonate or borate buffers pH ˜9 for reaction with isothiocyanates and dichlorotriazines. The appropriate reactive dye is then dissolved in a nonhydroxylic solvent (usually DMSO or DMF) in an amount sufficient to give a suitable degree of conjugation when added to a solution of the protein to be conjugated. The appropriate amount of dye for any protein or reactive dyes is predetermined by experimentation in which variable amounts of the dye are added to the protein, the conjugate is chromatographically purified to separate unconjugated dye and the dye-protein conjugate is tested in its desired application (see for example FIG. 1). Following addition of the reactive dye to the protein solution, the solution is incubated for a suitable period (typically ˜1 hour at room temperature to several hours on ice), the excess dye is removed by gel filtration, dialysis, HPLC, adsorption on an ion exchange or hydrophobic polymer or other suitable means. The dye-protein conjugate is used in solution or lyophilized. In this way, suitable conjugates can be prepared from antibodies, antibody fragments, avidins, lectins, enzymes, proteins A and G, cellular proteins, albumins, histones, growth factors, hormones, and other proteins. The approximate degree of dye substitution is determined from the long wavelength absorption of the dye-protein conjugate by using the extinction coefficient of the unreacted dye at its long wavelength absorption peak, the unmodified protein's absorption peak in the ultraviolet and by correcting the UV absorption of the conjugate for absorption by the dye in the UV. In this way data as in FIG. 1 are obtained.</p><p>Conjugates of polymers, including biopolymers and other higher molecular weight polymers are typically prepared by means well recognized in the art (for example, Brinkley et al., BIOCONJUGATE CHEM., 3, 2 (1992)). In these cases, a single type of reactive site may be available, as is typical for polysaccharides) or multiple types of reactive sites (e.g. amines, thiols, alcohols, phenols) may be available, as is typical for proteins. Selectivity of labeling is best obtained by selection of an appropriate reactive dye. For example, modification of thiols with a thiol-selective reagent such as a haloacetamide or maleimide, or modification of amines with an amine-reactive reagent such as an activated ester, acyl azide, isothiocyanate or 3,5-dichloro-2,4,6-triazine. Partial selectivity can also be obtained by careful control of the reaction conditions.</p><p>When modifying polymers with the dyes, an excess of dye is typically used, relative to the expected degree of dye substitution. Any residual, unreacted dye or a dye hydrolysis product is typically removed by dialysis, chromatography or precipitation (Example 111). Presence of residual, unconjugated dye can be detected by thin layer chromatography using a solvent that elutes the dye away from its conjugate. In all cases it is usually preferred that the reagents be kept as concentrated as practical so as to obtain adequate rates of conjugation.</p><p>In one aspect of the invention, the conjugate of the invention is associated with an additional substance, that binds either to the fluorophore or the conjugated substance through noncovalent interaction. In a specific embodiment, the additional substance is an antibody, an enzyme, a hapten, a lectin, a receptor, an oligonucleotide, a nucleic acid, a liposome, or a polymer. The additional substance is optionally used to probe for the location of the dye-conjugate, for example, as a means of enhancing the signal of the dye-conjugate.</p><p>In another embodiment of the invention, one of the reactive dyes of the invention is provided with instructions for conjugating the dye to any substance possessing an appropriate functional group, and optionally for recovering or purifying the materials labeled thereby. This combination of reactive dye and instructions therefore comprise a kit for labeling an appropriate substance. Selected appropriate substances include, but are not limited to, polymers of biological molecules (e.g. proteins, oligonucleotides or carbohydrates), polymeric resins and plastics (e.g. polystyrene), metals, glasses, and other organic or inorganic substances. The dyes of the present invention are well-suited for the preparation of such a kit.</p><p>BLOCKED dyes</p><p>In another embodiment of the invention, each R.sup.7 substituent is optionally a BLOCK moiety, such that when BLOCK is present, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is substantially altered or diminished. In addition, one of R.sup.8 or R.sup.9 may be a BLOCK moiety. Typically BLOCK is a monovalent moiety derived by removal of a hydroxy group from phosphate or from sulfate, or a biologically compatible salt thereof; or a monovalent moiety derived by removal of a hydroxy group from a carboxy group of an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid or of an amino acid, protected amino acid, peptide, or protected peptide; or a monovalent moiety derived by removal of a hydroxy group from an alcohol or from a mono- or polysaccharide. In each of these embodiments, BLOCK is selected to be removable from said compound by action of an appropriate enzyme.</p><p>Where R.sup.7 is a BLOCK, the BLOCK-fluorophore bond is typically an ether or ester bond. Where R.sup.8 or R.sup.9 is a BLOCK, the BLOCK-fluorophore is typically an amide bond resulting from removal of a hydroxy group from the carboxylic acid on an amino acid or peptide, and a hydrogen atom from the amino moiety on the xanthene dye.</p><p>In another embodiment of the invention, the BLOCK moiety is selected to be a photolabile caging group. The dye-conjugates of the present invention have particular utility where the conjugated substances is removable by action of an enzyme in solution, in a biological fluid, in a cell or a cell extract or immobilized on a polymer such as a biological membrane. In this case the preferred conjugated moieties are those that significantly reduce or eliminate the long wavelength fluorescence of the parent dye and that upon action of the enzyme restore this fluorescence (a BLOCK moiety).</p><p>It is generally recognized that dihydroxyxanthenes derivatives can form mono or disubstituted ethers or esters with one or both of its hydroxyl groups and that when both hydroxyl groups are blocked the product is typically a colorless lactone that is devoid of long wavelength fluorescence. For the dyes of the invention that are fluoresceins, this corresponds to those dye conjugates where each R.sup.7 is a BLOCK moiety, which may be the same or different (as shown below). For the dyes of the invention that are aminohydroxyxanthenes; such as rhodols, at least one of the substituents on the nitrogen atom is hydrogen and one of R.sup.8 or R.sup.9 is a BLOCK (as shown below). ##STR9##</p><p>Numerous examples of useful enzyme substrates based on fluorescein dyes are known, including examples in which the fluorescein dye is conjugated as an alkyl ether (formally derived by removal of a hydroxy group from an alcohol), or to the anomeric hydroxyl group of a carbohydrate, as an ester of a phosphate or sulfate, or as an ester of an aliphatic carboxylic acid (such as acetate) or an aromatic carboxylic acid (such as p-guanidinobenzoate). Enzymes that are known to cleave these conjugated moieties back to the free dye include microsomal dealkylases (for example, cytochrome P450 enzymes), glycosidases (for example β-galactosidase, β-glucosidase, α-fucosidase, β-glucosaminidase), phosphatases, sulfatases, esterases, lipases, guanidinobenzoatases and others. Conjugates of rhodol dyes that are amides of aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids, amino acids or peptides are typically useful as peptidase substrates. In addition, those substrates that are rhodol dyes that are blocked as an amide of a carboxylic acid are optionally additionally blocked on the rhodol oxygen atom by an additional BLOCK that is the same or different. Preferably the enzyme substrates of the present invention are fluorinated on the aryl ring portion of the dye.</p><p>Particularly preferred are derivatives that comprise two identical BLOCK moieties that are acetate or a glycoside, such as β-D-galactopyranoside that are at least tetrafluorinated on the aryl substituent. As with their known nonfluorinated analogs, for example fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and fluorescein digalactoside (FDG), these derivatives can be used for detecting enzymes in live cells. However, the polyfluorinated aryl derivatives yield fluorescent products that are much better retained in cells than are the corresponding nonfluorinated dyes, making them useful for cell tracing (Example 132), as probes for study of cell efflux mechanisms (Example 134) and for detecting enzymatic activity in cells (Examples 129 and 132). Selected examples of the substrates such as 6-methoxy-4,5,7-trifluorofluorescein di(β-D-galactopyranoside) yield exceptionally high fluorescence in cells possessing lyosomal β-galactosidase activity (Example 130).</p><p>Tetrafluorination of the blocked substrate was shown to yield at least some products that were thiol adducts of glutathione, an abundant intracellular tripeptide in most cells (Example 133), and of proteins, most likely conjugated through thiol groups (Example 113). This reaction, which makes use of an unexpected property of the aryl-ring tetrafluorinated dyes, is not possible using the nonfluorinated analogs or with analogs that are only fluorinated in the xanthene portion.</p><p>Additionally preferred for detection of enzymes that have maximal turnover rates below pH 7 are substrates that are fluorinated at the 2' and 7' positions, in particular wherein BLOCK is phosphate or BLOCK is β-D-galactopyranoside. Because of both the lower pK.sub.a of the hydrolysis product and faster turnover rates, these substrates have greater utility in continuous assays of enzymatic activity that are made near the pH optimum of the enzymes when that pH optimum is below 7. In particular, these substrates are superior for detection of acid phosphatase activity (Example 128) and an acidic β-galactosidase from bovine testes (Example 129).</p><p>When the substrate is a fluorinated rhodol dye, the amine is preferably an amide of a carboxylic acid, amino acid or peptide and the hydroxy function is preferably an ether so that the hydrolysis product is a rhodol ether. Alternatively, the amine is an amide and the oxygen function is a phosphate ester or a glycoside. In either case, the aryl substituent is preferably tetrafluorinated and the substrate is a lactone.</p><p>Particular examples of preferred fluorinated dyes that incorporate at least one BLOCK include, but are not limited to:</p><p>3'-acetoxy-6'-acetylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrafluorospiro(isobenzofuran)-1(3),9'-(9H)xanthen-3-one</p><p>6'-acetylamino-3'-phosphoryloxy-4,5,6,7-tetrafluorospiro(isobenzofuran)-1(3H),9'-(9B)xanthen-3-one, disodium salt</p><p>6'-amino-3'-methoxy-4,5,6,7-tetrafluorospiro(isobenzofuran)-1(3H),9'-(9H)xanthen-3-one</p><p>5-chloromethyl-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate</p><p>5-chloromethyl-2',7'-difluorofluorescein di-β-D-galactopyranoside</p><p>2',7'-difluoro-5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-β-D-galactopyranoside</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein-5-carboxylic acid diacetate</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein-5-carboxylic acid diacetate, succinimidyl ester</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein-5-carboxylic acid di(2-nitrobenzyl ether)</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein dibutyrate</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein di(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl ether)</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein diethyl ether</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein dioctadecanoate</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein di-β-D-galactopyranoside</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein di-β-D-glucuronide</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein di(4-guanidinobenzoate)</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein diphosphate, tetrasodium salt</p><p>2',7'-difluorofluorescein mono(4-guanidinobenzoate)</p><p>2',7'-difluoro-3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate</p><p>2',7'-difluoro-5-((pentafluorobenzoyl)amino)fluorescein diacetate</p><p>2',4,5,6,7,7'-hexafluorofluorescein diacetate</p><p>6'-L-leucylamino-3'-methoxy-4,5,6,7-tetrafluorospiro(isobenzofuran)-1(3H),9'-(9H)xanthen-3-one</p><p>2',4',5',7'-tetrafluorofluorescein diacetate</p><p>2',7'-difluorosulfonefluorescein diacetate</p><p>2',7'-difluorosulfonefluorescein diphosphate</p><p>4,5,6,7-tetrafluorofluorescein di-β-D-galactopyranoside</p><p>4,5,6,7-tetrafluorofluorescein diphosphate, tetraammonium salt</p><p>In general these enzyme substrates are prepared by chemistry that has previously been demonstrated for fluorescein dyes and tested for their suitability as enzyme substrates by methods commonly practiced in the art. In many cases, however, the lower pK.sub.a that is typical of the dyes of this invention facilitates continuous measurement of enzyme activity at a lower pH than is possible with the fluorescein analog. This is particularly important for use in monitoring the activity of enzyme such as prostatic acid phosphatase that has a low pH optimum (Example 128). Furthermore the greater photostability that is typical of many of the dyes of this invention make them more reliable for quantitative assays.</p><p>When these "blocked" dyes are further substituted by a reactive group that is a haloalkyl, haloacetamide, halomethylbenzamide or by a lipophilic moiety, the conjugates not only possess utility as reporter molecules for a particular enzyme of interest, but are also well-retained in cells due to the conjugation of the dye to intracellular thiols, among which is glutathione, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,148 to Haugland et al. (1993), U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,628 to Haugland et al. (1994) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,424 to Mao et al. (1996), all incorporated by reference. "Blocked" dyes that are enzyme substrates that are additionally polyfluorinated at positions R.sup.13 -R.sup.16 also possess utility as enzyme reporters that are well-retained in cells, due to the spontaneous reaction of these "bottom-ring" fluorine substituents with certain nucleophiles, including thiols, to yield stable dye-conjugates with intracellular components.</p><p>In an additional embodiment of the invention, the BLOCK moiety is a photolabile caging group, such that the fluorescence of the "blocked dye" is restored by photolytic illumination. Typically a caged dye is a dye wherein one or more R.sup.7 substituents is a BLOCK that is a cage that is a substituted or unsubstituted derivative of o-nitroarylmethine, including α-carboxy o-nitroarylmethine and bis-(5-t-butoxycarbonylmethoxy)-2-nitrobenzyl (Example 101), a substituted or unsubstituted derivative of 2-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl or a substituted or unsubstituted derivative of desyl. Where the BLOCK is present as R.sup.8 or R.sup.9, the caging group is typically attached to the amine of the fluorophore via an intermediate carboxyl linker (i.e. via a carbamate linkage). The caged dyes and dye-conjugates of the present invention possess advantageous properties with respect to conventional caged fluoresceins, as the enhanced photostability of the free dyes is better able to withstand the intense illumination sometimes required to photolyse the caging group.</p><p>Applications of the Dye-Conjugates/Method of Use</p><p>The compounds of the present invention are generally utilized to stain a sample to give a detectable optical response under desired conditions by a) preparing a dye solution comprising a dye compound described above, at a concentration sufficient to yield a detectable optical response under the desired conditions; combining the sample of interest with the dye solution for a period of time sufficient for the dye compound to yield a detectable optical response under the desired conditions; and c) illuminating the sample at a wavelength selected to elicit the optical response. Optionally, the sample is washed to remove residual, excess or unbound dye. The dye compound typically forms a covalent or non-covalent association or complex with an element of the sample, or is simply present within the bounds of the sample or portion of the sample. In one embodiment, the staining is used to determine a specified characteristic of the sample by further comparing the optical response with a standard or expected response. For example, the dye solution is used to monitor specific components of the sample with respect to their spatial and temporal distribution in the sample. Alternatively, the dye compound preferentially binds to a specific ingredient in a sample, enabling the researcher to determine the presence or quantity of that specific ingredient. In another alternative, the dye compound is used to analyze the sample for the presence of a mechanism that responds specifically to the dye compound. The desired analysis to be performed determines the composition of the dye solution and chemical nature of the dye itself. In another example, the dye is bound by an antibody directed against the dye itself, typically resulting the fluorescence quenching of the dye (as in Example 135).</p><p>For biological applications, the dye solution is typically an aqueous or mostly aqueous solution that comprises one or more of the described dye compounds. In one aspect of the invention, the dye solution comprises a fluorinated fluorophore of Formula I or Formula II described above; alternatively, the dye solution comprises a dye compound that is a reactive dye analog of Formula I or Formula II dyes, as previously described; in yet another aspect of the invention, the dye solution comprises a conjugate of the subject dyes, as described above. The term "dye compound" is used herein to refer to all aspects of the claimed fluorinated dyes, including the parent fluorinated dyes, reactive fluorinated dyes, fluorinated dye-conjugates and BLOCKED dyes.</p><p>Dye solutions of the subject compounds are prepared according to methods generally known in the art. As with related known fluorophores, the dyes and dye-conjugates are generally soluble in water and aqueous solutions having a pH greater than or equal to about 6. Stock solutions of pure dyes, however, are typically dissolved in organic solvent before diluting into aqueous solution or buffer. Preferred organic solvents are aprotic polar solvents such as DMSO, DMF, N-methylpyrrolidone, acetone, acetonitrile, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and other nonhydroxylic, completely water-miscible solvents. In general, the amount of dye or conjugate in the dye solution is the minimum amount required to yield detectable staining in the sample within a reasonable time, with minimal background fluorescence or undesireable staining. The exact concentration of dye or dye-conjugate to be used is dependent upon the experimental conditions and the desired results, and optimization of experimental conditions is typically required to determine the best concentration of stain to be used in a given application. The concentration of dye present in the dye solution typically ranges from nanomolar to micromolar. The required concentration for the dye solution is determined by systematic variation in dye or dye-conjugate concentration until satisfactory dye staining is accomplished. The starting ranges are readily determined from methods known in the art for use of similar compounds under comparable conditions for the desired optical response.</p><p>For those embodiments of the present invention that are substituted by alpha-acyloxyalkyl esters, or are substituted by sufficiently lipophilic moieties, the dye is optionally introduced into living cells by passive permeation through the cellular membranes. Less cell-permeant embodiments of the invention are optionally introduced into cells by pressure microinjection methods, scrape loading techniques (short mechanical disruption of the plasma membrane where the plasma membrane is peeled away from the cytoplasm, the dye is perfused through the sample and the plasma membrane is reassembled), patch clamp methods (where an opening is maintained in the plasma membrane for long periods) or phagocytosis. Any other treatment that will permeabilize the plasma membrane, such as electroporation, shock treatments or high extracellular ATP can be used to introduce the dye, dye-conjugate or BLOCKED dye into the cellular cytoplasm.</p><p>A detectable optical response means a change in, or occurrence of, a parameter in a test system that is capable of being perceived, either by direct observation or instrumentally. Such detectable responses include the change in, or appearance of, color, fluorescence, reflectance, chemiluminescence, light polarization, light scattering, or x-ray scattering. Typically the detectable response is a change in fluorescence, such as a change in the intensity, excitation or emission wavelength distribution of fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime, fluorescence polarization, or a combination thereof. The detectable optical response may occur throughout the sample or in a localized portion of the sample. The presence or absence of the optical response after the elapsed time is indicative of one or more characteristic of the sample. Comparison of the degree of staining with a standard or expected response can be used to determine whether and to what degree the sample possesses a given characteristic.</p><p>In one aspect of the invention, the dye solution comprises a fluorinated dye that non-covalently associates with organic or inorganic materials. Preferred embodiments of the fluorinated dyes that possess a lipophilic substituent can be used to stain lipid assemblies such as biological membranes or liposomes by non-covalent incorporation of the dye compound within the membrane, e.g. for use as probes for membrane structure or for incorporation in liposomes, lipoproteins, films, plastics, lipophilic microspheres or similar materials.</p><p>The fluorinated fluorescein dyes, and to a much lesser extent fluorinated rhodol dyes, are useful as coloring agents, tracers for detecting the flow of fluids such as in angiography, and tracing of fluid flow through gap junctions of neurons according to procedures known in the art for other xanthene derivatives. Fluorinated xanthene dyes are also useful in assays as haptens, according to known methods, because fluorination does not interfere with the recognition of the fluorophore by the anti-fluorescein antibody (Example 135).</p><p>In another aspect of the invention, the dye solution comprises a chemically reactive fluorinated dye that is used to chemically attach the dye to the corresponding functional group on any of a wide variety of materials, such as cells, tissues, proteins, antibodies, enzymes, drugs, hormones, lipids, nucleotides, nucleic acids, or natural or synthetic polymers. Fluorinated reactive dye compounds are selected to label reactive sites such as occur at the surface of cells, in cell membranes or in intracellular compartments such as organelles, or in the cell's cytoplasm, or to derivative low molecular weight compounds for their analysis by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), HPLC or other separation techniques. Certain reactive groups allow the retention of the fluorophore in cells or organelles by reacting with cellular materials. In particular, haloalkyl- or halomethylbenzamide-substituted fluorinated fluorophores are used to react selectively with intracellular components such as glutathione, or to retain the dye compounds within cells or within selected organelles where the dye compound is localized therein, according to methods previously described (U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,628 to Haugland et al, (1994); U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,424 to Mao et al. (1996) (in cells); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,268 to Haugland et al. (1995) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,261 to Zhang et al. (1997) (in mitochondria); all incorporated by reference). Polyfluoroaryl-substituted dye compounds are similarly retained in cells, in part by covalent attachment (see Examples 132 and 133). The reactive dyes are used to localize staining in a part of the sample, e.g., where the localization of the corresponding functional group is indicative of a characteristic of the sample; or to retain the dye in a specific portion of the sample for extended periods of time, e.g., to follow the stained portion of the sample through a period of time or sequence of events. Alternatively, the fluorinated reactive dyes are used according to this method to make dye-conjugates, as described above, that are separately useful for staining.</p><p>Typically, where the dye solution comprises a dye-conjugate, the dye conjugate is a labeled member of a specific binding pair, and is used as a fluorescent probe for the complementary member of that specific binding pair, each specific binding pair member having an area on the surface or in a cavity which specifically binds to and is complementary with a particular spatial and polar organization of the other. The fluorescent conjugate of a specific binding pair member is useful for detecting and optionally quantifying the presence of the complementary specific binding pair member in a sample, by methods that are well known in the art. Optionally, the complementary binding pair member is present in a animal cell, plant cell, bacteria, yeast or virus. Alternatively, the complementary member is immobilized on a solid or semi-solid surface, such as a polymer, polymeric membrane or polymeric particle (such as a polymeric bead). The dye-conjugate may also comprise a fluorinated dye in a BLOCKED form wherein the BLOCK is later removed by the action of an enzyme or light, or the conjugate may be one for which R.sup.11 is H, in which case detection is made following oxidation of the probe to a fluorescent dye.</p><p>Representative specific binding pairs are shown in Table 3. Typically a specific binding pair member conjugated to the dye is a ligand or a receptor. As used in this document, the term ligand means any organic compound for which a receptor naturally exists or can be prepared. A receptor is any compound or composition capable of recognizing a spatial or polar organization of a molecule, e.g. epitopic or determinant site. Ligands for which naturally occurring receptors exist include natural and synthetic proteins, including avidin and streptavidin, antibodies, enzymes, and hormones; nucleotides and natural or synthetic oligonucleotides, including primers for RNA and single- and double-stranded DNA; lipids; polysaccharides and carbohydrates; and a variety of drugs, including therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse and pesticides. The reactive dyes are used according to methods extensively known in the art, to prepare antibody conjugates for use in microscopy and immunofluorescent assays and nucleotide or oligonucleotide conjugates for nucleic acid hybridization assays and nucleic acid sequencing (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,332,666 to Prober, et al. (1994); 5,171,534 to Smith, et al. (1992); 4,997,928 to Hobbs (1991); and WO Appl. 94/05688 to Menchen, et al.; all incorporated by reference) and a wide variety of other applications. The nucleotide conjugates of the present invention are readily incorporated by DNA polymerase (Example 126) and can be used for in situ hybridization or other techniques (Example 127). Numerous fluorescence polarization assays have been developed that use conjugates of fluorescein dyes to low molecular weight drugs and ligands which will be improved by the use of the fluorinated dye compounds, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,420,568 to Wang (1983) and 4,510,251 to Kirkemo et al. (1985) (both incorporated by reference).</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 3______________________________________Representative Specific Binding Pairsantigen        antibody______________________________________biotin         avidin (or streptavidin or anti-biotin)IgG*           protein A or protein Gdrug           drug receptortoxin          toxin receptorcarbohydrate   lectin or carbohydrate receptorpeptide        peptide receptorprotein        protein receptorenzyme substrate          enzymeDNA (RNA)      apNA (aRNA)†hormone        hormone receptorion            chelator______________________________________ *IgG is an immunoglobulin †aDNA and aRNA are the antisense (complementary) strands used for hybridization</pre></p><p>Where a fluorinated dye is conjugated to a specific binding pair member that is a chelator of calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, or other biologically important metal ion, the dye-conjugate functions as an indicator of the ion, which indicators are optionally further conjugated to a biological or plastic polymer according to methods known in the art; e.g., using fluorinated analogs of the compounds described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,453,517 to Kuhn, et al. (1995); 5,405,975 to Kuhn, et al. (1995) (both incorporated by reference). Alternatively, the dye itself acts as a pH indicator (H.sup.30  ion indicator) at pH values within 1.5 pH units of the individual dye's pKa. Those dye embodiments having fluorine at R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are most useful as pH indicators over the range of pH 4-6. Typically the detectable optical response of the ion indicators is a change in fluorescence.</p><p>As indicated above, biological polymers can be labeled with a greater number of fluorinated dyes before quenching is observed. More typically, however, the substrate dye compound is a fluorinated dye that contains a -BLOCK moiety at positions R.sup.7, R.sup.8 or R.sup.9 as defined above, such that cleavage of -BLOCK yields a detectable response indicative of the presence of enzyme activity, or R.sup.11 is H, and oxidation of the dye yields a detectable response indicative of the presence of the oxidizing agent or enzyme. The enzyme substrates derived from fluorophores exhibiting enhanced photostability share that advantage. In addition, dye compounds having a pKa in an aqueous solution less than 6, more preferably less than about 5, are preferred for substrates to be used to assess enzyme activity in an acidic environment. For example, substrates where -BLOCK is cleaveable by a phosphatase enzyme are useful to detect acid phosphatase as well as alkaline phosphatase because, unlike substrates based on non-fluorinated analogs, a strong fluorescence response is evident with fluorinated substrates even when used in acidic environments. Alternatively, substrates wherein the dye compound has a pKa that is advantageous for acidic environments are useful in assessing the activity of enzymes found in acidic organelles, e.g. substrates for lysosomal glycosidases (see Example 130). Fluorinated diacetate compounds readily enter intact cells where the acetate moieties are cleaved by intracellular esterases in viable cells, restoring intrinsic fluorescence and serving as an indicator of viability. Similarly, fluorinated dyes that are substituted by acetoxymethyl ester (such as fluorinated analogs of calcein-AM, e.g. Compound 99, Example 99) readily enter intact cells and can serve as cell tracers or viability indicators, particularly where R.sup.11 is H.</p><p>In another substrate embodiment, the dye compounds are fluorinated dyes for which R.sup.11 is H, that are substrates for oxidative enzymes and other reactive oxidizing agents, particularly for peroxidase enzymes. In addition to the lowered pKa and enhanced photostability advantages of the parent fluorophores described above, the oxidative substrates possess additional undexpected advantages. Unlike their non-fluorinated analogs, fluorinated dihydrofluorescein and dihydrorhodol, are stable in aqueous solutions without the use of blocking groups on the hydroxyl or amine functions that typically reduce aqueous solubility. For example, Compound 84 (4,5,6,7-tetrafluorodihydrofluorescein, Example 85) is soluble in water to at least 2 mM, while existing diacetate fluorogenic peroxidase substrates are typically soluble only in the single-digit μM concentration range. Furthermore, 4,5,6,7-tetrafluorodihydrofluorescein is stable toward reaction of hydrogen peroxide during the period of analysis, in contrast to existing fluorogenic peroxidase substrates, which give fluorescence signal increase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide alone (i.e. in the absence of horseradish peroxidase).</p><p>The fluorinated enzyme substrates optionally contain additional substituents that provide additional advantages. Fluorinated fluorophores modified to contain a lipophilic tail according to the synthesis described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,148 to Haugland et al. (1993) (incorporated by reference), are useful for permeabilizing substrates for intracellular enzymes. Fluorinated fluorophores that are polyfluorinated on the 9-carboxyphenyl substituent serve to retain the enzyme substituents within an intact cell.</p><p>In one embodiment of the invention, the polyfluorinated fluorescein substrate compounds are used to determine the efficiency of a cellular efflux pump of cells in a sample. Typically, the fluorinated dye compound used for this purpose contains at least four fluorine substituents, where the remaining substituents are H or halogen; preferably, the fluorinated compounds have 4 fluorines on the pendent phenyl ring, and 2 halogens (preferably fluorine or chlorine) on the xanthene ring system at the 2- and 7-positions (R.sup.2 and R.sup.5). Preferably the dye compounds are diacetates or diphosphates. The dye compound is used in the minimum concentration that gives a detectable fluorescence emission. Once the diacetate compounds are inside the cell, the blocking acetates are cleaved and the compound becomes highly fluorescent. The efficiency of the cellular efflux pump of cells in the sample is determined by comparing the fluorescence emission of cells in the sample with the fluorescence of cells having a known efflux efficiency. Where the efflux pump is impaired, inhibited, or absent, the fluorescent compound is well retained in the cell; where the efflux pump is present and functioning, the fluorescence of the cells decreases markedly. The photostability of the fluorinated compounds is advantageous for monitoring the time course of fluorescence.</p><p>Another application where the enhanced photostability and also lower pKa of the subject fluorinated dye compounds are particularly advantageous is use of the dye compounds for tracing. One or more fluorinated dyes conjugated to a biologically compatible polymer, including amino acid polymers (typically proteins, including fluorescent proteins), carbohydrate polymers (typically dextrans), and polymeric microspheres (typically polystyrene) are readily prepared for use as tracers according to methods known in the art. Other dye compounds useful as tracers include fluorinated analogs of calcein; caged fluorinated xanthenes; haloalkyl-, halomethylbenzamide-, and perfluorobenzyl-substituted dye compounds; fluorinated dye compounds conjugated to chelators of ions; and fluorinated dye compounds containing a lipophilic substituent, optionally incorporated into liposomes.</p><p>The dye compounds are most advantageously used to stain biological samples, i.e. samples that comprise biological components. In one aspect of the invention, the sample comprises heterogeneous mixtures of components, including intact cells, cell extracts, bacteria, viruses, organelles, and mixtures thereof. In another aspect of the invention, the sample comprises a single component or homogeneous group of components, e.g. biological polymers such as amino acid polymers, nucleic acid polymers or carbohydrate polymers, or lipid membrane complexes, whether the polymers are synthetic or natural.</p><p>The sample is typically stained by passive means, i.e., by incubation with the dye solution. Any other method of introducing the dye into the sample, such as microinjection of a dye solution into a cell or organelle, can be used to accelerate introduction of the dye into the sample. The dyes of the present invention are generally non-toxic to living cells and other biological components, within the concentrations of use, although those fluorinated dyes that are additionally substituted one or more times by Br or I are efficient photosensitizers. Cells have been incubated in dye solution for at least five hours without observable ill effects.</p><p>The sample can be observed immediately after staining. The sample is optionally combined with other solutions in the course of staining, including wash solutions, permeabilization and/or fixation solutions, and other solutions containing additional detection reagents. Washing following staining generally improves the detection of the optical response due to the decrease in non-specific background fluorescence after washing. Satisfactory visualization is possible without washing by using lower labeling concentrations. A number of fixatives and fixation conditions suitable for practicing this invention are known in the art, including formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, formalin, glutaraldehyde, cold methanol and 3:1 methanol:acetic acid. Fixation is typically used to preserve cellular morphology and to reduce biohazards when working with pathogenic samples. Selected embodiments of the dyes described above are well retained in cells, and sample cells stained with these dyes retain considerable fluorescent staining after fixation. Fixation is optionally followed or accompanied by permeabilization, such as with acetone, ethanol, DMSO or various detergents, to allow bulky dye compounds, including dye-conjugates described above, to cross cell membranes, according to methods generally known in the art. The staining of the present invention is optionally combined with the use of an additional detection reagent that produces a detectable response due to the presence of a specific cell component, intracellular substance, or cellular condition, according to methods generally known in the art. Where the additional detection reagent has spectral properties that differ from those of the subject dye compounds, multi-color applications are possible.</p><p>At any time after or during staining, the sample is illuminated with a wavelength of light that results in a detectable optical response, and observed with a means for detecting the optical response. While the dye compounds are detectable colorimetrically, using ambient light, typically the dye compounds are detected by the fluorescence properties of the parent fluorophore. Upon illumination, such as by an ultraviolet or visible wavelength emission lamp, an arc lamp, a laser, or even sunlight or ordinary room light, the dye compounds, including dye compounds bound to the complementary specific binding pair member, display intense visible absorption as well as fluorescence emission. Selected equipment that is useful for illuminating the dye-conjugates of the invention includes, but is not limited to, hand-held ultraviolet lamps, mercury arc lamps, xenon lamps, argon lasers, laser diodes, and YAG lasers. These illumination sources are optionally integrated into laser scanners, fluorescence microplate readers, standard or mini fluorometers, or chromatographic detectors. This colorimetric absorbance or fluorescence emission is optionally detected by visual inspection, or by use of any of the following devices: CCD cameras, video cameras, photographic film, laser scanning devices, fluorometers, photodiodes, quantum counters, epifluorescence microscopes, scanning microscopes, flow cytometers, fluorescence microplate readers, or by means for amplifying the signal such as photomultiplier tubes. Where the sample is examined using a flow cytometer, a fluorescence microscope or a fluorometer, the instrument is optionally used to distinguish and discriminate between the fluorinated dye compound and a second fluorophore with detectably different optical properties, typically by distinguishing the fluorescence response of the fluorinated dye-conjugate from that of the second fluorophore. Where the sample is examined using a flow cytometer, examination of the sample optionally includes isolation of particles within the sample based on the fluorescence response of the dye compound by using a sorting device.</p><p>Typical Embodiments</p><p>Specific embodiments of fluorinated dyes, reactive fluorinated dyes and fluorinated dye conjugates include but are not limited to fluorinated

CHEM. SOC. PERKIN TRANS. I, 1658 (1980), followed by boron tribromide-mediated demethylation. 2-Fluororesorcinol and 2,4-difluororesorcinol can be prepared in low yield as a mixture upon electrophilic fluorination of resorcinol (Patrick et al. J. ORG. CHEM. 51, 3242 (1986)) or its diethers (Lerman et al. J. ORG. CHEM. 49, 806 (1984)), using reagents such as SELECTFLUOR (trademark of Air Products for 1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1,4-diazonia-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, bistetrafluoroborate) followed by preparative HPLC separation and then dealkylation. More conveniently, fluorinated resorcinols and aminophenols are synthesized reliably and in high yield beginning with the appropriate (commercially available) polyfluoronitrobenzenes or their alkoxy-substituted derivatives, many of which are commercially available (Examples 1-4). Two equivalents of alkoxide or benzyloxide are added, displacing any fluorine atoms that occur ortho and para to the nitro group. The nitro group is reduced via catalytic hydrogenation or chemical reduction, followed by diazotization and in situ reductive dediazonization using hypophosphorous acid; alternatively, diazonium cations can be isolated pure as tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate salts, followed by reduction to the arene with sodium borohydride. Dealkylation with boron tribromide or another ether-cleaving reagent, or in the case of benzyl ethers, catalytic hydrogenolysis, then affords isomerically and constitutionally pure fluorinated resorcinols. Several other moieties are optionally present during these synthetic steps, provided that they resist the steps required for synthesis of the fluorinated resorcinol. These moieties include alkyl, carboxyalkyl, chloro, bromo, iodo, alkoxy and hydroxy, while hydroxy moietites may also be formed during cleavage of alkoxy groups present in the starting material.</p><p>Fluorinated aminophenols are prepared using similar methodology. For instance, alkyl-substituted amine nucleophiles may be substituted onto a polyfluoronitrobenzene, in sequence with alkoxide or benzyloxide, resulting in fluorinated aminophenols after the nitro group is removed by reduction followed by diazotization and hydrodediazoniation (Examples 18-22). These fluorinated aminophenols may then be used to prepare fluorinated rhodol fluorophores. A different means of synthesizing fluorinated aminophenols involves converting commercially available fluorinated nitrophenyl ketones and aldehydes into the corresponding phenolic esters using Baeyer-Villiger oxidation chemistry. N-Substitution is accomplished via reductive amination or by direct allylation to yield the desired N-substituted aminophenol. Deacylation of the phenolic hydroxyl then gives the desired fluorinated aminophenol (Examples 23-25).</p><p>Xanthylium dyes having fluorine substituents on the xanthene portion of the dye are typically prepared by condensation of the appropriate fluorinated resorcinol with various derivatives of phthalic acid or phthalic anhydride or sulfobenzoic acid or anhydride, including phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, nitrophthalic anhydride, o-sulfobenzoic anhydride, sulfoterephthalic acid, or with benzaldehydes (when followed by oxidation, as in Example 58 or Example 82) or with aliphatic dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides such as a succinic anhydride or a glutaric anhydride (Example 83). This condensation occurs in the presence or absence of various acid catalysts (such as zinc chloride or methanesulfonic acid), and after an aqueous workup yields the desired fluorinated xanthylium dye.</p><p>Fluorinated xanthylium dyes are also obtained by the condensation of two equivalents of a resorcinol, either unsubstituted or substituted, with a fluorinated benzenecarbonyl compound. Particularly useful fluorinated carboxyphenyl compounds include tetrafluorophthalic anhydride, tetrafluorophthalic acid or fluorophthalic acid derivatives, pentafluorobenzoic acid, and fluorinated benzaldehydes such as pentafluorobenzaldehyde (an oxidation step is required after using fluorinated benzaldehydes to give the fluorescent xanthylium dye). In the resulting dye the fluorinated aryl ring pendant to the xanthene ring system is the "aryl substituent" of the dye. For fluorinated xanthylium dyes that have fluorine atoms at the 4- and 6-positions of the bottom ring, heteroatom nucleophiles such as reduced glutathione, mercaptoacetic acid (Examples 59, 60, 61), mercaptoethylamine and azide are substituted at the 4- or 6-positions, by displacement of a fluoride ion, affording a synthetic route to functionality that can be elaborated into a variety of reactive groups for subsequent conjugation chemistry. For example, the carboxylate group of the mercaptoacetic acid adduct is converted into a reactive succinimidyl ester (Examples 64, 65, 67 and 68), or the amine of the mercaptoethyl amino is converted into a reactive isothiocyanate, maleimide or haloacetamide; alternatively the azide group is reduced to an amine, which is then acylated with iodoacetic anhydride to provide an iodoacetamide.</p><p>Fluorinated xanthylium dyes are also obtained beginning with polyfluorinated benzonitriles. Addition of an alkoxide or a benzyloxide to the benzonitrile displaces the fluorine atoms ortho- and para- to the nitrile group. Addition of an arylorganometallic reagent, such as pentafluorophenylmagnesium chloride, converts the nitrile group to an imine, which is subsequently hydrolyzed, affording a substituted benzophenone with alkoxy groups at the 2- and 4-positions. The alkoxy groups are dealkylated, for example with hydrobromic acid and acetic acid. Treatment with sodium hydroxide in methanol then gives a xanthenone, in which the 2-hydroxy group has displaced the 2'-fluorine atom; concomitantly, an alkoxy group displaces the 4'-fluorine atom. The 3-hydroxy group in the resulting xanthone is typically protected by a base-stable protecting group, such as a 2-methoxyethylmethyl ether (MEM ether), and then an arylorganometallic reagent such as pentafluorophenyl magnesium chloride or an alkyl lithium reagent is added to the xanthone carbonyl group. Subsequent treatment with hydrobromic and acetic acid dehydrates the resulting tertiary carbinol to the desired xanthylium dye, with concomitant conversion of the 6-methoxy group to a hydroxyl group.</p><p>For asymmetric xanthylium dyes such as rhodols and unsymmetrical xanthylium dyes such as rhodols and unsymmetrical fluoresceins, condensation can be performed using one equivalent each of the appropriate substituted or unsubstituted resorcinol with one equivalent of a different resorcinol (as in Khanna et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,359 (1984)), aminophenol and with one equivalent of the appropriate phthalic acid derivative or benzaldehyde (phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, nitrophthalic anhydride, tetrafluorophthalic anhydride, sulfoterephthalic acid, succinic anhydride, or their corresponding phthalic acids or pentafluorobenzaldehyde) using acid catalysis. The desired asymmetrical xanthylium dye is separated from any unwanted symmetrical dye side-product using chromatographic techniques well-known in the art.</p><p>Alternatively, asymmetric xanthylium dyes are constructed in a stepwise fashion: A selected fluorinated resorcinol or aminophenol is condensed with one equivalent of the appropriate phthalic acid derivative or benzaldehyde. The resulting benzophenone derivative is typically isolated, purified and then condensed with one equivalent of a different fluorinated or non-fluorinated resorcinol or aminophenol yielding the asymetric dye. Alternatively, the symmetrical xanthylium dye is hydrolyzed by strong base to the benzophenone compound and treated with a different aminophenol or resorcinol to yield the unsymmetrical product.</p><p>Post-condensation modifications of fluorinated xanthylium dyes are typically strictly analogous to known methods of fluorescein modification. For example, the xanthenone portion of a fluorinated fluorescein can be halogenated at selected non-fluorinated positions by treatment with the appropriate halogenating agent, such as liquid bromine. Where either or both of the 4' or 5' positions of a fluorinated fluorescein are occupied by hydrogen atoms, the 4' and 5' positions can be substituted with aminomethyl groups using Mannich conditions (as in Kirkemo et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,510,251, supra). As used herein, substituted amines optionally include iminodiacetic acid (Examples 98, 99) and aminoacids. When trimellitic anhydride is used in the dye synthesis, and thus a bottom-ring carboxylate is present in the fluorinated dye, this carboxylate group can be converted into a thiol-reactive chloromethyl or bromomethyl substituent by reduction to the corresponding alcohol followed by treatment with HCl or HBr (Example 72). When trimellitic anhydride or its derivatives is used in the dye synthesis, two isomeric carboxylates are typically formed. These isomers are separated (General Method J) or, as in most cases, used as the mixture of isomers. The reduced derivatives of fluorinated xanthylium dyes (i.e., those of formula 2) are prepared by chemical reduction of the xanthenone portion with zinc dust or borohydride in organic solvents. These dihydrofluorinated dyes can serve as substrates for enzymes that take up electrons, or in the detection of chemical oxidizing agents, reactive oxygen species or nitric oxides. Other enzyme substrates of the fluorinated xanthylium dyes involve, for example, acylation of the phenolic hydroxyls of fluorinated dyes with phosphate (to give phosphatase substrates, Examples 96 and 97), carboxylic acids (to give esterase substrates, Examples 26, 28, 29, 31 and 32), alkylation with alkyl groups (to give dealkylase substrates) and carbohydrates to yield glycosidase substrates (Examples 90-95). In addition, rhodols are optionally acylated by methods well known in the art to yield amido derivatives or treated with sulfonyl halides to yield sulfonamides.</p><p>The dihydroxanthene and xanthylium versions of the dyes of the invention and their conjugates are generally freely interconvertible by chemical oxidation or reduction. Reagents useful for this reduction include borohydrides, aluminum hydrides, hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, and dithionites. Choice of the reducing agent may depend on the ease of reduction of other reducible groups in the molecule. A wide variety of oxidizing agents mediate the oxidation of the dihydroxanthenes, including molecular oxygen in the presence or absence of a catalyst, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, dichromate, triphenylcarbenium and chloranil. The xanthenes are also oxidized by enzyme action, including the action of horseradish peroxidase in combination with peroxides (Example 131) or solely by nitric oxide. This oxidation may occur in a cell, or in a cell-free solution.</p><p>Specific embodiments of the dyes of the present invention that possess particular utility for the preparation of dye-conjugates are amino, hydroxy and carboxy derivatives of the fluorinated fluorophores, as these derivatives are readily converted to a wide variety of other reactive derivatives. These reactive derivatives in turn can be conjugated to amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, lipids, drugs, toxins, ligands and other molecules of interest using standard chemistry that is typically accomplished at or near room temperature. For instance, amine derivatives are converted to isocyanates, isothiocyanates, ureas, thioureas, urethanes, semicarbazides, dichlorotriazinyl amines, amides, haloacetamides, maleimides, acrylamides, azides, hydrazines or alkylated amines; carboxylic acids are converted to esters or activated esters capable of forming amides or esters, amides, hydrazides, acid halides, acyl azides, acyl nitriles or reduced to aldehydes or alcohols; hydroxy groups are esterified, alkylated to ethers including glycosides, or converted to alkylating agents such as halogens or sulfonate esters. Other synthetic stratagies for the preparation of useful reactive derivatives include the formation of aldehydes, glyoxals, thiols, epoxides, aziridines, sulfonyl halides, imido esters, borates or phosphoramidites. Alkenes for use in polymerization can be incorporated by various means, including reacting with functionalized styrenes or allylamines or by reaction of an amine on the dye with an acrylic acid derivative. All of these reactions are accomplished using methods well known in the art. The reactions that are typically used to couple the reactive fluorophores of the invention with molecules of interest include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table 2.</p><p>Examples of synthetic strategies for selected fluorinated fluorophores, as well as their characterization, synthetic precursors, conjugates and method of use are given below.
