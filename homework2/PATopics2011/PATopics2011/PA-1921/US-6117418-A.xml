No. 5,858,336, Jan. 12, 1999.</p><?description-type Brief Summary?><heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention relates generally to a stick composition. More particularly, this invention relates to a stick composition that exhibits improved transparency and translucency, and demonstrates improved stability, especially with respect to syneresis and maintenance of transparency/translucency. The present invention also provides an improved clear stick composition that can be used to deliver topically deodorants and fragrances.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Stick compositions are often used as topical delivery vehicles in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. For example, stick compositions may be used to deliver ingredients such as deodorants/antiperspirants and fragrances. In particular, it has been discovered that stick deodorants and/or antiperspirants that are clear or translucent (instead of opaque) are preferred by many consumers.</p><p>However, many clear stick compositions suffer from certain limitations. Some compositions are unstable over time or under the extremes of temperature encountered during shipment and storage. Others cause an unpleasant stinging sensation when they are applied to sensitive skin areas, such as the underarm area. Some such compositions produce sticks that are very hard, and do not have adequate payoff on the skin. Accordingly, a demand exists for a stick composition that has improved transparency/translucency and improved stability, any also has a smooth, silky feel on contact with skin.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a clear stick deodorant that has improved clarity and improved stability.</p><p>It is another object of the present invention to provide such a clear stick composition that is stable over time and under a wide range of temperatures.</p><p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a clear stick composition that is economical to manufacture.</p><p>It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a clear stick composition that does not sting when applied to skin.</p><p>To the accomplishment of the foregoing objects and advantages, the present invention, in brief summary, is a stick composition including a solvent, a gelling agent, a plasticizing/solubilizing agent, and a clarity/stability enhancing agent. Preferably, the clarity/stability enhancing agent is PPG-10 butanediol.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The stick composition of the present invention provides a solid mass that is rigid enough to maintain its shape as a stick, but that is soft enough to provide good payoff of the product as well as deliver the active ingredient or ingredients to the skin. In addition, the stick composition is stable over time and under extreme temperature conditions, especially those temperature conditions encountered during shipping and storage. The stick composition of the present invention resists syneresis better than most conventional stick compositions. The terms "stick composition(s)" and "clear stick composition(s)" are used interchangeably herein.</p><p>Stick compositions according to the present invention include a solvent, a gelling agent, a plasticizing/solubilizing agent (hereinafter referred to as "plasticizer(s)") and a clarity/stability enhancing agent.</p><p>The solvent is preferably a C.sub.2 to C.sub.6 polyhydric alcohol, water, or a combination thereof. The polyhydric alcohol serves also as an emollient. Preferably, the polyhydric alcohol is propylene glycol. Most preferably, the solvent is a mixture of water and propylene glycol. The solvent is preferably present at about 70 to about 95 weight percent (wt %), with a range from about 70 to about 90 wt % being more preferred. When the solvent includes water, the stick composition preferably has from about 10 to about 20 wt % water. All weight percentages (wt %) disclosed herein are based upon the total weight of the stick composition unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The stick composition of the present invention includes a gelling agent. The gelling agent is preferably present at about 4 to about 10 wt %, with a range from about 5 to about 8 wt % being preferred. The gelling agent is preferably a soap-type gelling agent. More preferably, the gelling agent is a mixture of sodium salts of different fatty acids (hereinafter "sodium salt fatty acid mixture"). Most preferably, the sodium salt fatty acid mixture includes sodium stearate.</p><p>It is also preferred that the sodium stearate is a mixture of two or more commercially available grades of sodium stearate (hereinafter "sodium stearate mixture"). When the gelling agent is the sodium stearate mixture, it is preferred that the stick composition has up to about 8 wt % of the sodium stearate mixture. For enhanced stability, the sodium stearate mixture preferably is a mixture of two commercial grades of sodium stearate, hereinafter "sodium stearate grade 1" and "sodium stearate grade 2", respectively. The sodium stearate grade 1 preferably contains from about 30% to about 41% C.sub.20 and higher saturated chain length fatty acids. The most preferred sodium stearate grade 1 is sodium stearate (OP-200) sold by RTD Chemicals. The sodium stearate grade 2 preferably contains more than about 88% C.sub.16 and C.sub.18 fatty acids, and up to about 2% fatty acids longer than C.sub.18. The most preferred sodium stearate grade 2, is sodium stearate C-1 sold by Witco. This preferred sodium stearate mixture provides a superior balance of acceptable product odor, transparency and syneresis resistance. Tables A and B, below, set forth the preferred fatty acid distribution for the sodium stearate grade 1 and sodium stearate grade 2, respectively. The percentages of fatty acids set forth above and below are based upon the total percentage of fatty acids in each respective sodium stearate grade, and is not based upon the total weight of the stick composition.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE A______________________________________Preferred fatty acid distribution for sodium stearate grade 1Chain Length of Fatty Acid                  Percentage______________________________________C12:0* and lower       3.0 maxC14:0                  3.0 maxC14:1** &amp; C15:0        2.0 maxC16:0                  20.0 to 30.0C16:1 and C17:0        2.0 maxC18:0                  30.0 to 40.0C18:1 and C19:0        2.0 maxC20:0                  15.0 to 18.0C22:0                  15.0 to 20.0Greater than C22:0     3.0 max______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE B______________________________________Preferred fatty acid distribution for sodium stearate grade 2Chain Length of Fatty Acid                  Percentage______________________________________C12:0* and lower       2.0 maxC14:0                  6.0 maxC14:1** &amp; C15:0        2.0 maxC16:0                  50.0 to 70.0C16:1 and C17:0        3.0 maxC18:0                  38.0 to 46.0Greater than C18:0     2.0 max______________________________________ *":0" denotes a saturated fatty acid. **":1" denotes a fatty acid having 1 double bond.</pre></p><p>The present invention also includes a plasticizer. Related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/949,219 (which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference), which is owned by the assignee of the present invention, disclosed that the addition of certain plasticizers provided clear or translucent deodorant stick compositions that avoided the limitations of the prior art. Plasticizers disclosed in the aforementioned application, such as polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene 2-decyltetradecyl ethers and ethoxylated dimethicone copolyols, are also useful in the present invention.</p><p>In plasticizers having an ethylene oxide, it is believed that the moles of ethylene oxide component can range from about 4 moles to about 50 moles. Examples of more preferred plasticizers for practicing the present invention are the NIKKOL PEN series of solubilizers sold by Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd.

The CTFA adopted names for these compounds are PPG-6-decyltetradeceth-12, PPG-6-decyltetradeceth-20, and PPG-6-decyltetradeceth-30 respectively. The most preferred plasticizer is PEG-15-PPG-6-Isotetracosanyl ether. A non-limiting example of the foregoing most preferred plasticizer is available from Heterene Inc. under the tradename Hetoxol I 24-EP-15-6.</p><p>The plasticizer is preferably present at about 1 wt % to about 10 wt %, more preferably at about 1.5 wt % to about 6 wt %, with about 3 wt % to about 5 wt % being most preferred. Table C below sets forth the preferred plasticizers/solubilizers and their preferred ranges.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE C______________________________________          Preferred Most Preferred          Range (wt %)                    (wt %)______________________________________PPG-6-decyltetradeceth-12            2.5-6       4.5PPG-6-decyltetradeceth-20            2.5-5.5     3.5PPG-6-decyltetradeceth-30            1.5-4.5     3.0PEG-15-PPG-6-Isotetracosanyl            2.5-5       4.5ether______________________________________</pre></p><p>Other plasticizers are also preferred for use in the stick compositions of the present invention. These plasticizers may be used in place of, or in addition to, the preferred PEN series. Of these, the preferred plasticizer is an ethoxylated dimethicone copolyol. It is preferred that the ethoxylated dimethicone copolyol be present at about 2 to about 6 wt %, with about 3.5 wt % to about 4 wt % being more preferred. Most preferred for use in the stick compositions of the present invention is Silicone Fluid SF1288, CTFA name Dimethicone Copolyol, available commercially from GE Silicones.</p><p>The clarity/stability enhancing agent provides the improved clear stick composition of the present invention, with improved initial clarity/transparency, and also enhances the high temperature stability of the stick composition. Also, syneresis is decreased even when sticks are stored at 110 agent also improves the initial appearance and stability of stick compositions having PEN solubilizers.</p><p>The clarity/stability enhancing agent is a PPG C.sub.3 to C.sub.8 polyol. The stick composition of the present invention has from 3 wt % to about 10 wt %, more preferably 5 wt %, of the PPG C.sub.3 to C.sub.8 polyol. The PPG C.sub.3 to C.sub.8 polyol component is most preferably polyoxypropylene (10) butanediol (hereinafter "PPG-10 butanediol"). A non-limiting example of a PPG-10 butanediol that may be used in the present invention is available from Croda, Inc. under the tradename Probutyl DB-10.</p><p>Although it is preferred that the PPG C.sub.3 to C.sub.8 polyol has a butanediol component, the length of the carbon chain can be increased up to C.sub.8 if there is a corresponding increase in hydroxyl groups. The corresponding increase in hydroxyl groups is required to maintain solubility of the PPG C.sub.3 to C.sub.8 polyol. A non-limiting example of such a contemplated PPG C.sub.3 to C.sub.8 polyol is PPG 10 hexahydric octanol. In addition, it is also believed that the mole percentage of PPG can also be increased if accompanied by a proportional increase in hydroxyl groups in order to maintain solubility.</p><p>The stick compositions of the present invention may include adjunct ingredients such as deodorants, antiperspirants, emollients, colorants, glitter agents, pigmented/colored particles, medicinal agents, fragrances and cooling agents or rubifacients/warming agents. Because of the improved clarity of the stick composition, the visibility of incorporated glitter agents and/or colored particles through the stick composition will be enhanced, thus, providing a more pleasing overall appearance. Examples of such glitter agents include coated/treated polyethylene terephthalate and titanium dioxide coated mica. A non-limiting example of such a coated/treated polyethylene terephthalate is available from Glitterex Corp. under the tradename 0.008" square Dark Gold poly*flake. A non-limiting example of such a titanium dioxide coated mica is available from Presperse Inc. under the tradename Flonac ME 10 C. In the alternative, opacifying agents can also be added if a clear or translucent product is not desired.</p><p>One example of a preferred stick composition of the present invention is a clear stick deodorant. In U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/949,219, it was disclosed that the addition of PPG-10 butanediol enhanced the high temperature stability of clear stick deodorants having ethoxylated dimethicone copolyol plasticizers when stored at 110 month. However, it is believed that the addition of the clarity/stability enhancing agent of the present invention will enhance the stability of clear stick deodorant having other plasticizers, such as those disclosed herein. In fact, it has been found that PPG-10 butanediol provides better stability with respect to clarity in a clear stick deodorant composition than either Amidox C-5 or Procetyl-10. (Amidox C-5 is the tradename of an alkoxylated alkanol amide available from Stepan, Inc. Procetyl-10 is a tradename of a PPG-10 cetyl ether available from Croda, Inc.)</p><p>When the present invention is a clear stick deodorant, the clear stick composition further includes an odor-controlling agent. The odor-controlling agent is preferably a germicidal agent, a deodorizing agent, a masking agent, or a mixture thereof.</p><p>It is more preferred that the clear stick deodorants of the present invention include a germicidal agent. Of the commercially available germicidal agents suitable for use in underarm deodorants, the most preferred is a trichlorohydroxy diphenyl ether (CTFA name Triclosan). A non-limiting example of such a trichlorohydroxy diphenyl ether is available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp under the tradename Irgasan DP-300. The germicidal agent is preferably present at less than about 2 wt %.</p><p>It is preferred that such clear stick deodorants also include a fragrance or other deodorizing or masking agent. Most commercially available fragrances are suitable for use in the clear stick deodorants of the present invention. Preferably, the fragrance is present at less than about 2 wt %.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><p>The following are examples of two clear stick compositions according to the present invention.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________Ingredient        Weight Percent (wt %)______________________________________Example 1A clear stick deodorant composition.Propylene glycol-solvent             69.185Demineralized water-solvent             15.00Sodium stearate-geliant             6.00Dimethicone copolyol-ws-             3.50ethoxyiatedsolubilizer/plasticizerTrichlorohydroxy  0.30diphenyl ether-germicidePPG-10 butanediol-clarity/             5.00stability enhahcing agentFragrance         1.00FD&amp;C dyes         0.015Example 2A contemplated clear stick composition.Propylene glycol-solvent             69.485Demineralized water-solvent             15.00Sodium stearate-gellant             6.00PPG-6-decyltetradeceth-20             3.50solubilizer/plasticizerPPG-10 butanediol 5.00clarity/stabilityenhancing agentFragrance         1.00FD&amp;C dyes         0.015______________________________________</pre></p><p>It must be emphasized that the clear stick composition of the present invention is useful for delivering a variety of components, such as fragrances, cooling agents, pigmented particles, glittering agents, rubifacients and medicinal agents.</p><p>The present invention provides a stick composition that is substantially transparent or translucent and that has a smooth, silky feel on contact with the skin.</p><p>The invention having been thus described with particular reference to the preferred forms thereof, it will be obvious that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What is claimed is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
