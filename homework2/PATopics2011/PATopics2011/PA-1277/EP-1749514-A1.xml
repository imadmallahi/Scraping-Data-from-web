The silver-containing ceramic, providing an antimicrobial effect, may be either a silver-containing glass powder or a silver-containing zeolite powder, and may contain additional antimicrobial agents such as zinc and/or copper. Other components may also be included, such as a filler, a colorant, a stabilizer to improve the shelf-life of the composition, a stabilizer against the effects of ultraviolet (UV) light, etc.</p><p num="p0011">The silver-containing ceramic provides a sustained release of active components, i.e. silver, into an oral environment surrounding a restoration, and helps to prevent secondary caries adjacent to the restoration where gaps develop between the restoration and the tooth structure. When incorporated into dental restorative compositions, the mechanical strength, optical properties, and shelf-stability of the resulting material was not compromised.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p num="p0012">The silver-containing ceramic and at least one monomer having at least one ethylenically unsaturated group may be used in a two-part dental composition containing a redox polymerization initiator. The two parts are the catalyst part and the base part, with each part containing one component of the redox initiator system. The base part usually contains the reducing agent of the redox initiator system, while the catalyst part contains the oxidizing agent of the redox initiator system. The composition is cured when the catalyst part is mixed with the base part, initiating free radical polymerization, and the composition is said to be a self-cure composition (without external activation source such as light or heat). A photo-initiator can be optionally incorporated in the base part of the composition to obtain a dual-cure (self-cure and light-cure) two-part composition. It was know to dental manufacturers and dental practitioners that the catalyst part containing the oxidizing agent generally had a limited color stability and became discolored after storage for about six months. However, when the silver-containing ceramic was incorporated into the composition, the catalyst part exhibited significantly improved color stability, providing a two-part dental composition of more consistent color.</p><p num="p0013">The silver-containing ceramic is a silver-containing glass powder or a silver-containing zeolite powder. In one embodiment, the powders have a mean particle size of less than 30 Âµm. In another embodiment, the powders have a mean particle size less than 5 Âµm. The silver-containing glass can be silveraluminophosphate glass or silveraluminosilicate glass. The glass may also contain other antibacterial elements, such as zinc and/or copper, to enhance the antimicrobial effect. During the glass making process, additional elements may be introduced for ease of manufacture, for imparting radiopacity to the dental composition, for release of fluoride, etc. Examples of such elements include boron, phosphor, fluorine, calcium, barium, strontium, or other alkali/alkaline metal elements. The silver is incorporated into the glass by melting together the silver-containing compound with other glass forming ingredients during manufacture of the glass. One silver-containing glass antimicrobial additive is Irgaguard<sup>Â®</sup> B7000 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation, Tarrytown NY). Irgaguard<sup>Â®</sup> B7000 is a mixture of silver-zinc glass fine powder and barium sulfate fine powder, with a mean particle size of 1.8 Âµm.</p><p num="p0014">The silver-containing zeolite powder can be prepared by replacing some or all of the ion-exchangeable metal ions, usually alkali or alkaline metal ions, of zeolite particles with silver ions through an ion-exchange process in an aqueous solution containing silver ions.

Zeolites include A zeolite, Z zeolite, Y zeolite, and mordenite. Other antimicrobial metal ions such as zinc and copper ions, in addition to silver ions, can also be incorporated by the ion-exchange process. In one embodiment, silver-zinc zeolite is used where silver ions and zinc ions are incorporated onto the ion-exchangeable sites of the zeolite through an ion-exchange process. One silver-zinc zeolite is Irgaguard<sup>Â®</sup> B5000 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation, Tarrytown NY). Irgaguard<sup>Â®</sup> B5000 has a mean particle size of 0.3 Âµm.</p><p num="p0015">The concentration range for the silver-containing ceramic ranges from about 0.01%<sup>w/w</sup> to about 10%<sup>w/w</sup> of the composition. In one embodiment, the concentration range is from about O.05%<sup>w/w</sup> to about 5.0% <sup>w/w</sup> of the composition.</p><p num="p0016">Any monomers having at least one ethylenically unsaturated group may be used. Examples of ethylenically unsaturated groups include vinyl, acrylate, and methacrylate groups. Examples of monomers include, but not limited to, the following, where (meth)acrylate denotes acrylate or methacrylate: hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate; glycerol di(meth)acrylate, glycerol mono(meth)acrylate, methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, hexyl (meth)acrylate, octyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, decyl (meth)acrylate, tridecyl (meth)acrylate; 2-ethoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2'-ethoxy-2-ethoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, ethyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate, diethyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate, triethyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate, tetraethyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate, polyethyleneglycol mono-(meth)acrylate, polyethyleneglycol di-(meth)acrylate, polypropyleneglycol mono-(meth)acrylate, polypropyleneglycol di-(meth)acrylate, polytetramethyleneglycol mono-(meth)acrylate, polytetramethyleneglycol di-(meth)acrylate, hexanediol di(meth)acrylate, trimethyloylpropane tri(meth)acrylate, UDMA (reaction product of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with 2,4,4-trimethylhexane diisocyanate), 2,2-bis[4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloylpropoxy)-phenyl]-propane (Bis-GMA), ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate (EBPADMA-n, n is the total number of moles of ethylene oxide in the molecule; in one embodiment n is 2-20 units), tetrahydrofurfuryl (meth)acrylate, or a mixture thereof. In various embodiments, the monomers contain more than one ethylenically unsaturated group per molecule.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p num="p0017">The free-radical polymerization initiator may be any initiator that can initiate free radical polymerization of monomers with an ethylenically unsaturated group, and may be one or more photo-initiator(s), redox initiator(s), and/or heat (thermal) initiator(s). Examples of photo-initiators include benzoin, benzoin ethers and esters, 2,2-diethoxy acetophenone, diketone compounds, bisacylphosphine oxide, diaryliodonium salt, and/or triarylsulfonium salt. Additionally, an activator such as a tertiary amine can be used with the photo-initiators to enhance curing efficiency. Photo-initiator systems may include camphoroquinone and a tertiary amine such as ethyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamino) benzoate, 2-(ethylhexyl)-4-(N,N-dimethylamino) benzoate, and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. A redox initiator system has at least one reducing agent and at least one oxidizing agent. The reducing agent may be a tertiary amine or an organic compound containing the -SO<sub>2</sub>M (where M is H or alkali metal ion) group. In various embodiments, the reducing agent may be N,N-dihydroxyethyl p-toluidine, N,N-dimethyl p-toluidine, N,N-dimethylaminophenylethyl alcohol, N,N-dimethylaminophenylacetic acid, benzenesulfinic acid, toluenesulfinic acid, sodium benzenesulfinate, potassium benzenesulfinate, sodium toluenesulfmate, potassium toluenesulfinate. The oxidizing agent may be a peroxide, such as benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, t-butyl hydrogen peroxide. A heat initiator may be a peroxide, persulfate, or azo compound, such as benzoyl peroxide, potassium persulfate, 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile), and 1,1'-azo-di-(hexahydrobenzonitrile).</p><p num="p0018">The photo-initiator, redox initiator, and heat initiator can be used alone or in combination. A heat initiator may be used in a single part, heat-cure only system such as in an inlay, onlay, or crown composition. A photo-initiator may be used in a single part, light-cure only system, such as in a light-cure composite filling material or light-cure veneer cement. The redox initiator may be used in a two-part self-cure (i.e. curing without the activation of light or heat) composition with each part containing one component (either the oxidizing agent or the reducing agent) of the redox initiator system. The photo-initiator can be used in combination with the redox initiator system to make the system dual-cure, i.e. both light-cure and self-cure. The heat-cure initiator and photo-initiator can be used together in a single part dual-cure system, i.e. both light-cure and heat-cure. The concentration of the initiator(s) is in the range of about 0.01%<sup>w/w</sup> to about 5.0%<sup>w/w</sup>. In one embodiment, the concentration of the initiator(s) is in the range of about 0.05%<sup>w/w</sup> to about 3.0%<sup>w/w</sup>.</p><p num="p0019">A filler is optional, depending upon the application. While most compositions require the use of a filler, a primer or an adhesive composition may not contain a filler. A filler may be used to enhance mechanical properties, reduce polymerization shrinkage, improve rheological properties, and increase<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> radiopacity of the composition for easy detection of gaps or voids. Examples of fillers include inorganic metal, salt, oxide, silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminoborosilicate, fluoroaluminosilicate, colloidal silica, precipitated silica, polymeric filler, and/or polymerized composite filler with reinforcing inorganic particles. Inorganic fillers for increased x-ray contrast include metals, silicates, aluminosilicates, salts and oxides containing elements of high atomic number including strontium, bismuth, tungsten, barium, yterbium, ytrium etc. Examples include barium sulfate, silver, strontium fluoride, barium fluoride, yterbium fluoride, ytrium fluoride, barium tungstate, zinc oxide, zirconia, bismuth(III) oxide, bariumaluminosilicate, bariumaluminoborosilicate, strontiumaluminosilicate, bariumaluminoflnorosilicate, strontiumaluminofluorosilicate, zincaluminosilicate, zirconiumaluminosilicate, etc. Fumed silica, colloidal silica, or precipitated silica can also be incorporated to improve the dispersion of the filler, as well as the rheological and handling properties of the material. Examples of colloidal silicas are "Aerosil" series "OX-50", "OX-130", and "OX-200" silica sold by Degussa (Ridgefield Park NJ), "Cab-O-Sil M5" and "Cab-O-Sil TS-530" silica sold by Cabot Corporation (Tuscola IL).

Mixtures of different fillers can be used.</p><p num="p0020">For inorganic fillers, the surface of the filler may be treated or coated with a coupling agent such as gamma-methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (A-174). A coupling agent enhances the interfacial bonding between the filler and resin matrix, and improves mechanical properties of the composition. Mean particle sizes of the filler are less than 20 Âµm, and in one embodiment are less than 5 Âµm. The concentration range of total filler(s) is 0% up to about 95% by weight, depending on the application. For primer or adhesive applications, the concentration range is 0% up to about 60%. For cement applications, the concentration range is about 20% up to about 75%. For filling materials, the concentration range is about 30% up to about 95%.</p><p num="p0021">Other components may be incorporated in the inventive composition, including colorants, stabilizers, UV absorbers, and other antimicrobials. Colorants are used to achieve a desired shade, and may be inorganic pigments or organic dyes. Stabilizers are polymerization inhibitors to improve the shelf stability of the composition. Most commonly used stabilizers include 2,6-di-(<i>tert</i>-butyl)-4-methylphenol (BHT) and 4-methoxyphenol (MEHQ). UV absorbers are used to improve the color stability of the restorative material upon exposure to UV light.

The antibacterial additives can be incorporated into a single-part dental restorative material, such as a light-curable material (with a light-cure initiator), or heat-curable material (with a heat-cure initiator),<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> or a combination of heat- and light-curable material. The light-curable material can be a composite filling material, a cement, a pit/fissure sealant, a base, or a liner. The heat-curable material can be a prosthetic material such as an inlay, an onlay, or a crown material that is polymerized extra-orally by heat or a combination of light and heat, and then adhered to the tooth structure with an adhesive and/or a cement. The antibacterial additives can also be incorporated into a two-part dental material such as a self-curable (with a redox initiator system) or dual-curable (combination of self-cure and heat-cure, or combination of light-cure and self-cure) material. Overall any configurations (such as light-cure versus self-cure or dual-cure; one-part versus two-part; filling material versus cement, liner, or adhesive, or endodontic sealing material; composite resin versus hybrid material such as resin-ionomer or resin-modified glass-ionomer) can be easily obtained by incorporating different curing initiators (photo-initiator, heat-cure initiator, redox initiator, or a combination thereof), filler type (reactive filler and/or non-reactive filler), and modifying viscosity (varying filler concentration, and/or use of solvent).</p><p num="p0043">The above examples are for illustrations only, and should not be construed to limit the scope of this invention.
