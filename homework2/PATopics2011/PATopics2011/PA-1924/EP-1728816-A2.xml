First, a film is provided that comprises one or more thermoplastic polymers and at least about 0.01 weight % of photothermic material based on the weight of the film. Next, the film is exposed to an amount of non-ionizing radiation effective for the photothermic material to generate sufficient heat to cause an effect selected from one or more of: 1) shrinking the film by at least about 5% in at least one direction and 2) increasing the tension in the film by at least about 50 pounds per square inch (psi) in at least one direction.</p><heading><u style="single">Film with a Shrink Characteristic</u></heading><p num="p0007">The film comprising the photothermic material (i.e., the film), or a layer of the film, may comprise one or more thermoplastic polymers, for example, one or more of polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene), ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymers, ionomers, vinyl plastics (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride), polyamide, and polyester. The film, or any of the film layers (e.g., any of the film layers discussed below), may comprise any of polymers discussed below in at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following weight percent values: 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, 99 and 100% by weight of the film or by weight of the layer. The film may be a packaging film, such as a food packaging film.</p><heading><u style="single">Polyolefins</u></heading><p num="p0008">Useful polyolefins include ethylene homo- and co-polymers and propylene homo- and co-polymers. The term "polyolefins" includes copolymers that contain at least 50 weight % monomer units derived from olefin. Ethylene homopolymers include high density polyethylene ("HDPE") and low density polyethylene ("LDPE"). Ethylene copolymers include ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers ("EAOs"), ethylene/unsaturated ester copolymers, and ethylene/(meth)acrylic<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> acid. ("Copolymer" as used in this application means a polymer derived from two or more types of monomers, and includes terpolymers, etc.)</p><p num="p0009">EAOs are copolymers of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins, the copolymer having ethylene as the majority mole-percentage content. The comonomer may include one or more C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>20</sub> α-olefins, one or more C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>12</sub> α-olefins, and one or more C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>8</sub> α-olefins. Useful α-olefins include 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="p0010">EAOs include one or more of the following: 1) medium density polyethylene ("MDPE"), for example having a density of from 0.926 to 0.94 g/cm3; 2) linear medium density polyethylene ("LMDPE"), for example having a density of from 0.926 to 0.94 g/cm3; 3) linear low density polyethylene ("LLDPE"), for example having a density of from 0.915 to 0.930 g/cm3; 4) very-low or ultra-low density polyethylene ("VLDPE" and "ULDPE"), for example having density below 0.915 g/cm3, and 5) homogeneous EAOs. Useful EAOs include those having a density of less than about any of the following: 0.925, 0.922, 0.920, 0.917, 0.915, 0.912, 0.910, 0.907, 0.905, 0.903, 0.900, and 0.898 grams/cubic centimeter. Unless otherwise indicated, all polymer densities herein are measured according to ASTM D1505.</p><p num="p0011">The polyethylene polymers may be either heterogeneous or homogeneous. As is known in the art, heterogeneous polymers have a relatively wide variation in molecular weight and composition distribution. Heterogeneous polymers may be prepared with, for example, conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts.</p><p num="p0012">On the other hand, homogeneous polymers are typically prepared using metallocene or other single-site catalysts. Such single-site catalysts typically have only one type of catalytic site, which is believed to be the basis for the homogeneity of the polymers resulting from the polymerization. Homogeneous polymers are structurally different from heterogeneous polymers in that homogeneous polymers exhibit a relatively even sequencing of comonomers within a chain, a mirroring of sequence distribution in all chains, and a similarity of length of all chains. As a result, homogeneous polymers have relatively narrow molecular weight and composition distributions. Examples of homogeneous polymers include the metallocene-catalyzed linear homogeneous ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer resins available from the Exxon Chemical Company (Baytown, TX) under the EXACT trademark, linear homogeneous ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer resins available from the Mitsui Petrochemical Corporation under the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> TAFMER trademark, and long-chain branched, metallocene-catalyzed homogeneous ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer resins available from the Dow Chemical Company under the AFFINITY trademark.</p><p num="p0013">Another useful ethylene copolymer is ethylene/unsaturated ester copolymer, which is the copolymer of ethylene and one or more unsaturated ester monomers.

The vinyl ester monomer may have from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, from 4 to 5 carbon atoms, and preferably 4 carbon atoms.</p><p num="p0015">Representative examples of the second ("alkyl (meth)acrylate") group of monomers include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate. The alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer may have from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, and preferably from 4 to 5 carbon atoms.</p><p num="p0016">The unsaturated ester (i.e., vinyl ester or alkyl (meth)acrylate) comonomer content of the ethylene/unsaturated ester copolymer may be at least about 3, 6, and 8 wt. % and/or may be at most about 12, 18, and 40 wt. %, based on the weight of the copolymer.

Exemplary EPDM copolymer include those sold under the Vistalon™ trademark.</p><p num="p0020">Useful propylene copolymer includes propylene/ethylene copolymers ("EPC") and propylene/butene copolymers, which are copolymers of propylene and ethylene, and propylene and butene, respectively, having a majority weight % content of propylene, such as those having, for example, an ethylene comonomer content of less than about 10%, less than about 6%, and/or at least about 2% by weight.</p><heading><u style="single">EVOH</u></heading><p num="p0021">Ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer ("EVOH") is another useful thermoplastic. EVOH may have an ethylene content of about 32%, or at least about any of the following values: 20%, 25%, 30%, and 38% by weight.

Useful ionomers include those in which sufficient metal ion is present to neutralize from about 10% to about 60% of the acid groups in the ionomer. The carboxylic acid is preferably "(meth)acrylic acid" - which means acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid. Useful ionomers include those having at least 50 weight % and preferably at least 80 weight % ethylene units. Useful ionomers also include those having from<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> 1 to 20 weight percent acid units. Useful ionomers are available, for example, from Dupont Corporation (Wilmington, DE) under the SURLYN trademark.</p><heading><u style="single">Vinyl Plastics</u></heading><p num="p0023">Useful vinyl plastics include polyvinyl chloride ("PVC"), vinylidene chloride polymer ("PVdC"), and polyvinyl alcohol ("PVOH"). Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") refers to a vinyl chloride-containing polymer or copolymer - that is, a polymer that includes at least 50 weight percent monomer units derived from vinyl chloride (CH<sub>2</sub> = CHCl) and also, optionally, one or more comonomer units, for example, derived from vinyl acetate.

"Activating the shrink characteristic of the film" means that the film is exposed to conditions that cause one or more of: 1) the film to shrink by at least about 5% of the length in at least one direction (for example, if the film or film portion is unrestrained) or 2) the tension in the film to increase by at least about 50 psi in at least one direction (for example, if the film or film portion is restrained).</p><p num="p0116">Accordingly, the film comprising photothermic material may be exposed to an amount of non-ionizing radiation energy effective for the photothermic material to generate heat to cause one or more of the following effects: 1) shrink the film by at least about 5% in at least one direction, for example, if the film or film portion is in an unrestrained state and 2) increase the tension in the film by at least about 50 pounds per square inch (psi) in at least one direction, for example if the film or film portion is in a restrained state.</p><p num="p0117">The film may be exposed to an amount of non-ionizing radiation effective to shrink the film in at least one direction by at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following values: 7%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 95%. The film may shrink in at least two directions (e.g., the machine and transverse directions) by any of the<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> previous amounts. The film may shrink unequally in both directions, that is differing free shrink in the machine and transverse directions. The film may not shrink in both directions. For example, the film may shrink in one direction by less than about any of the following: 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% and 1%; or the film may not shrink in one direction as a result of the radiation exposing step.</p><p num="p0118">The film may be exposed to an amount of non-ionizing radiation energy effective to increase the tension in the film in at least one direction by at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following values: 75 psi, 100 psi, 125 psi, 150 psi, 175 psi, 200 psi, 225 psi, 250 psi, 275 psi, 300 psi, 325 psi, 500 psi, 600 psi, 700 psi, 800 psi, 1,000 psi, and 1,500 psi. The film may have an unequal increase in shrink tension in both directions, that is differing shrink tension in the machine and transverse directions. The film may not have an increase in shrink tension in one or both directions.</p><p num="p0119">The film may be exposed to an amount of non-ionizing radiation energy effective to shrink the film in at least one direction by at least about any of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, and/or 80 percentage points more than the shrink value in the same direction obtainable by exposing a comparative film - which differs from the film only by lacking the photothermic material -- to the same amount of non-ionizing radiation under the same conditions. For example, a film comprising a photothermic material may be exposed to an amount of radiation energy effective to shrink the film by at least about 13 % (measured according to ASTM D 2732)

where exposure of a comparative film (lacking the photothermic material) to the same amount of non-ionizing radiation under the same conditions shrinks in the machine direction by 8 % (measured according to ASTM D 2732).</p><p num="p0120">The film may be exposed to an amount of non-ionizing radiation energy effective to increase the tension in the film in at least one direction by at least about any of 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 130, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and/or 400 psi more than the increase in shrink in the same direction obtainable by exposing a comparative film - which differs from the film only by lacking the photothermic material -- to the same amount of non-ionizing radiation under the same conditions. For example, a film comprising a photothermic material may be exposed to an amount of radiation energy effective to increase the shrink tension in the film by at least about 100 psi (measured according to ASTM 2838) where exposure of a comparative film (lacking the photothermic material) to the same amount of non-ionizing radiation under the same conditions<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> increases the shrink tension in the machine direction by 50 psi (measured according to ASTM 2838).</p><p num="p0121">The temperature of the film at the start of the non-ionizing radiation exposure step may be below the shrink initiation temperature of the film, that is, below the minimum temperature at which the shrink characteristic of the film is activated. The temperature of the film at the start of the non-ionizing radiation exposure step may be below the shrink initiation temperature of the film by at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 70, 90, 100, 120, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, and 220°F. The temperature of the film at the start of the non-ionizing radiation exposure step may be at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following: -20, -10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 70, 90, 100, 120, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, and 220°F. To achieve these temperatures, the film may be heated or cooled before the start of the non-ionizing radiation exposure step; for example, the film may be heated other than by radiation exposure. Such heating or cooling may occur, for example, by conduction or forced-convection, such as in a water bath or air tunnel.</p><p num="p0122">The effective amount of non-ionizing radiation of the exposing step may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of non-ionizing radiation having wavelengths of at most about, and/or at least about, any of the following: 200, 210, 250, 280, 290, 300, 310, 315, 320, 330, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365, 370, 375, 380, 390, 400, 410, 470, 475, 500, 510, 560, 570, 620, 630, and 700 nm. The effective amount of non-ionizing radiation of the exposing step may be essentially devoid of non-ionizing radiation having wavelengths of at least about, and/or at most about, any of the wavelengths in the preceding sentence.</p><p num="p0123">The effective amount of non-ionizing radiation energy of the exposing step may comprise radiation having wavelengths of at least about, and/or at most about, any of the wavelength ranges in the preceding paragraph in at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following amounts: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 95 % based on the total amount of non-ionizing radiation energy of the exposing step.</p><p num="p0124">The effective amount of non-ionizing radiation energy may further comprise one or more of infrared light, microwave, and radiowave radiation in at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following amounts: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 95 % based on the total amount of non-ionizing radiation energy of the exposing step. The non-ionizing<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> radiation of the exposing step may be essentially devoid of any one or more of the following:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>infrared light, microwave, and radiowave radiation. For example, the non-ionizing radiation of the exposing step may be essentially devoid of infrared light. Also, the effective amount of non-ionizing radiation energy may be essentially devoid of microwave energy in the 2.54 nm wavelength range in order to avoid exciting (heating) water or water-bearing product (e.g., food) that may be enclosed in a package comprising the film.</li></ul></p><p num="p0125">The radiation energy amount (e.g., the surface dosage for the non-ionizing radiation) of the exposing step may be delivered within a duration of at most about, and/or at least about, any of the following: 900, 500, 300, 100, 80, 50, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, and 0.001 seconds. The delivery of the radiation amount may be substantially continuous during the duration time period, or may occur in a discontinuous manner over the exposure duration time period, for example by at least, and/or at most, of any of the following: l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 20 pulses of radiation.</p><p num="p0126">If multiple pulses of radiation are used, then it may be beneficial for the intervals between the pulses of radiation energy to be short enough so that the multiple pulses may have cumulative effect. An individual pulse of radiation may have a duration of at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following values: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, and 900 milliseconds. Further, the radiation energy amount may be delivered by a pulsed source operating at from about 1 to about 120 Hz.</p><p num="p0127">The duration discussed above may also be considered a residence time for a portion of the film that is in the exposure zone of a non-ionizing radiation delivery device (e.g., a UV lamp), for example, where the film is in the form of a continuous web that travels beneath a non-ionizing radiation delivery device, which may be continuously irradiating that portion of the web that travels through the non-ionizing radiation exposure zone.</p><p num="p0128">The effective amount of non-ionizing radiation energy may be considered a function of the radiation intensity (i.e., the rate of radiation energy flow per unit area) and the duration of the radiation exposure, to achieve an effective surface dose (i.e., the radiation energy per unit area at the surface of the film). The relationship between these factors may be illustrated by the following equation: (intensity) x (duration) = surface dose.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --></p><p num="p0129">The non-ionizing radiation energy exposure step may comprise a non-ionizing average radiation intensity over the duration period (measured at the surface of the film) of at least about any of the following: 10, 30, 50, 80, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 800, 1,000, 1,200, 1,500, and 1,800 mW/cm2; and at most about any of the following: 2,000, 1,800, 1,500, 1,200, 1,000, 800, 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, and 100 mW/cm2. If the non-ionizing radiation is delivered discontinuously (e.g., as a series of pulses) over the duration period, then any of these forgoing intensity values may describe the average non-ionizing radiation intensity over the duration. Further, any of these forgoing intensities may occur during one or more pulses of radiation, if the radiation energy is delivered in a discontinuous manner. Any of these intensities may be derived solely from the amount of UV radiation energy present in the non-ionizing radiation exposure step (e.g., UV radiation in any of the UV wavelength ranges described above), or may be derived solely from UV radiation in any of the UV wavelength ranges described above.</p><p num="p0130">The amount of non-ionizing radiation energy (measured at the surface of the film) of the exposing step delivered during any of the durations discussed above may include at least about, and/or at most about, any of the following surface doses: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 mJ/cm2 (i.e., milli-Joules/cm2). Any of these surface doses may be derived solely from the amount of UV radiation energy present in the non-ionizing radiation exposure step (e.g., UV radiation in any of the UV wavelength ranges described above), or may be derived solely from UV radiation in any of the UV wavelength ranges described above.</p><p num="p0131">The radiation intensity of the non-ionizing radiation may be measured at the surface of the film utilizing the types of detectors, filters, and radiometers that are correctly calibrated and appropriate for the wavelength ranges of the radiation being measured, as is known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0002" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>A. Ryer, "Light Measurement Handbook" (1998, International Light, Inc., Newburyport, MA</text></nplcit>), which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. For example, a silicon detector type may be useful for measuring the radiation intensity for radiation wavelengths of from about 250 to about 1050 nm, in conjunction with a radiometer such as the IL 1700 (International Light Inc.).<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --></p><p num="p0132">As is also known to those of skill in the art, if a broad range of non-ionizing radiation wavelengths contributes to the radiation being measured, then one or more filters may be used to reduce or eliminate the radiation wavelengths for which a particular detector type is not appropriate or optimum, and the previously filtered radiation wavelength ranges may be subsequently measured with an appropriate detector while filtering the previously measured radiation wavelengths. The total radiation intensity may be calculated by summing the radiation intensities of the separate measurements of different wavelength ranges.</p><p num="p0133">Useful equipment and methods for providing various types of non-ionizing radiation energy are known to those of skill in the art. For example, the radiation energy may be provided by a photoflash, a flashlamp (e.g., pulsed, gas-filled flashlamps), arc lamps, excimer lamps, spark-gap discharge apparatus, and solid state devices such as UV LED (Light Emitting Diodes).</p><p num="p0134">For example, the radiation energy may be provided by a pulsed lamp system such as those available from Xenon Corp. (Woburn, MA) (e.g., model RC-740, dual lamp and model RC-747 pulsating xenon light) and Maxwell Laboratories, Inc. (e.g., Flashblast Model FB-100 pulsed light system), and those described in <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="US5034235A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patents 5,034,235</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="US6449923B" status="new"><text>6,449,923</text></patcit>.</p><p num="p0135">Also by way of example, the radiation energy may be provided by low pressure, medium pressure or high pressure mercury arc lamps. Medium pressure mercury arc lamps are available from a variety of suppliers such as Fusion UV Systems, Gaithersburg, MD.</p><heading><u style="single">Shrink Packaging a Product</u></heading><p num="p0136">A package (e.g., a bag or a food package system) may comprise the film comprising the photothermic material. A product (i.e., an object) may be packaged by enclosing the product in the package comprising the film. For example, the film may be wrapped around an object to be packaged (i.e., a product) and sealed around its edges. A bag may comprise the film, for example, by heat sealing the film to itself to form the bag into which an object (i.e. a product, for example, a food product) may be placed. The air pressure in the package, such as a bag, may be lowered (e.g., vacuum) and the package subsequently sealed or clipped closed.</p><p num="p0137">The package may optionally be heated, for example by other than radiation exposure, so that the temperature of the film is placed within any of the temperature ranges<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> discussed above with respect to the film temperature at the start of the non-ionizing radiation exposure step.</p><p num="p0138">The package may then be exposed to the amount of non-ionizing radiation effective to activate the shrink characteristic of the film, as discussed above. Upon activation of the shrink characteristic of the film, the film may contract about the packaged object to provide a tight package appearance. The activation of the shrink characteristic of the film of the package may occur without exposing the film to an external thermal heat source such as those sources used to activate shrink characteristic by thermal conduction (e.g., a water bath or hot-air tunnel). Alternatively, the shrink characteristic of the film of the package may be activated by exposure to an external thermal heat source (such as those sources used to activate shrink characteristic by thermal conduction) at a time selected from one or more of before, during, or after the step of exposing the film to an effective amount of non-ionizing radiation to activate the shrink characteristic of the film of the package.</p><p num="p0139">To facilitate the contraction of the film, a vent hole may be cut into a portion of the film to allow trapped air to escape from the package as the film shrinks.</p><p num="p0140">The package may comprise a lid comprising the film comprising the photothermic material. For example, a lid may be sealed to a tray to enclose a product; see, for example, <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="US6627273B" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 6,627,273</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="US20144102A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent Application 10/201,441 filed July 23, 2002</text></patcit>, each of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Such lids may be modified to incorporate the photothermic material as set forth in this Application. Upon activation of the shrink characteristic, the lid may form a tight, wrinkle-free appearance.</p><p num="p0141">Products (i.e., objects) that may be packaged in a package comprising the film include food (e.g., meat, such as fresh or frozen red meat or poultry, frozen pizzas), paper products (e.g., stationery, plates, cards, calendars), toys, games, hardware, and information storage devices (e.g., cassettes, compact discs).</p><p num="p0142">An article that is used to provide a protective coating, surface, cladding, or insulation may incorporate the film described in this Application comprising photothermic material. Such an article may be used, for example, to reduce the likelihood of corrosion or an electrical short at a spice, cable termination, or feed-through assembly. Such a product may be a "shrink sleeve," a term that as used herein includes those products known in the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> telecommunication and power transmission fields as "heat shrink sleeves," "splice closures," "heat shrink tubes," "heat recoverable tubes," and "cable seals." Any of these products may comprise the film of the present invention, and the shrink characteristic of the film incorporated into the shrink sleeve may be activated by the exposure to an effective amount of non-ionizing radiation as set forth in this Application. For example, a tube may be made by sealing the film to itself, or the film may be made in tubular form. The workpiece (e.g., cable or splice) to be protected may be inserted within the article, and the article may then be exposed to an amount of non-ionizing radiation effective to activate the shrink characteristic. For example, a tubing article comprising the film may form a tight enclosure to help protect the wire and splice from water exposure.
