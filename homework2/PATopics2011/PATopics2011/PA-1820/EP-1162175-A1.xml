various advantages over traditional pigment formulations.
More specifically, the present invention relates to the
use of rare earth manganese oxide compositions for use in
pigmentary applications. The rare earth constituent may
include yttrium, lanthanum and/or metals in the
Lanthanide Series of the Periodic Table. The pigments
may be used in plastics, paints, coatings, glass enamels
and other materials.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</u></heading><p num="0002">Pigments are widely used in various
applications such as paints, inks, plastics, rubbers,
ceramics, enamels and glasses. There are various reasons
for using inorganic pigments. Pigments may impart
coloristic properties and reflectance properties in the
visible as well as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR)
reflectance spectrums. Their ability to perform this
task depends upon which wavelengths are scattered, and
which are absorbed when light interacts with them. In
order to be suitable in a wide variety of applications,
pigments must demonstrate a high degree of light fastness
and high temperature stability. A summary of many
inorganic pigments and some of their applications can be
found in Volume 18 of the Fourth Edition of the Kirk-Othmer
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 1996.
Classifications of conventional pigments are also given
in the publication "DCMA: Classification and Chemical 
Description of the Mixed Metal Oxide Inorganic Colored
Pigments", Second Edition, January 1982.</p><p num="0003">Typical black or dark colored pigments for the
plastics industry are based on either carbon black, Cr-Fe
based hematite blacks, or blacks formulated from various
elements, usually containing two or more of the elements
Ni, Mn, Cu, Fe and Cr arranged in a spinel type
structure. In plastic applications with solar exposure,
carbon black pigments absorb light not only in the
visible range, but also in the infrared region. This
leads to higher temperatures on the exposed colored
surface, which may lead to higher cooling costs, or
premature failure or degradation of the exposed part.
Conventional Cu-Cr oxide compositions, which may contain
other additives, do not have particularly good IR
reflective properties, but they are useful at moderately
elevated temperatures above the exposure temperatures at
which carbon black is stable.</p><p num="0004">Hematite pigments composed of Cr-Fe and spinel
pigments composed of transition metal oxides often
exhibit IR reflective properties. This means that the
pigments reflect more light outside the visible range,
particularly in the infrared range, than in the visible
range. This provides similar color as other pigments,
but with a lower temperature when the object is exposed
to infrared radiation.</p><p num="0005">Currently, several of the pigments classified
in the Dry Color Manufacturers Association
Classifications (DCMA) are used due to their IR
reflective performance. The IR reflective performance is
determined by the relative amount of reflectance provided
in the solar infrared region of the spectrum, i.e. 
wavelengths of 700 to 2,500 nm compared with the visible
region of the spectrum, i.e. wavelengths of 400 to 700
nm. Common black pigments such as carbon black have low
reflectances in both regions. To obtain enhanced IR
reflectance, inorganic black pigments from the
classification DCMA 13-50-9 chrome iron nickel black
spinel, or DCMA 3-05-3 chrome green black spinel, are
conventionally used for these applications. The pigment
DCMA 13-30-3 cobalt chromite green spinel also provides
relatively high IR reflectance.</p><p num="0006">Manganese is used as a chromophore in several
mixed metal oxide pigments. In the corundum structure,
it is used to form manganese alumina pink corundum (DCMA
3-04-5). It is used as a chromophore in the rutile
structure to form brown pigments, such as manganese
antimony titanium buff rutile (DCMA 11-20-6), manganese
chrome antimony titanium brown rutile (DCMA 11-46-7) and
manganese niobium titanium brown rutile (DCMA 11-47-7).
It is also a component in many spinel pigments to form
brown or black colors. Examples are manganese ferrite
black spinel (DCMA 13-41-9), chrome iron manganese brown
spinel (DCMA 13-48-7) and chrome manganese zinc brown
spinel (DCMA 13-51-7).</p><p num="0007">The above mentioned pigments may not provide
the desired color values, have the desired chemistry
and/or provide the desired infrared reflectance
properties for many applications. The present invention
provides pigments with enhanced color, composition and
performance characteristics. </p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0008">This invention relates to rare earth manganese
oxide pigments that can be represented by the formula
(Re<sub>x</sub>Mn)O<sub>y</sub>, where Re represents at least one rare earth
element selected from yttrium, lanthanum and elements in
the Lanthanide Series of the Periodic Table, x ranges
from 0.01 to 99, and y designates the number of oxygen
atoms required to maintain electroneutrality.
Preferably, x ranges from 0.08 to 12, more preferably
from 0.25 to 4, and y ranges from x+1 to 2x+2. These
colorants can be used to form colored objects or coatings
through their use in applications such as paints, inks,
plastics, glasses, ceramics and the like.</p><p num="0009">An aspect of the present invention is to
provide rare earth manganese oxide pigments which impart
favorable coloristic properties in the visible spectrum.
For example, intense black color may be obtained by these
pigments, some of which may also be bluish in shade. The
rare earth manganese oxide pigments have shown superior
stability and weatherability. These properties are
desirable in a wide range of colorant applications.</p><p num="0010">In accordance with another aspect of the
present invention, rare earth manganese oxide pigments
provide high infrared reflectance. Yttrium manganese
oxide is a particularly preferred pigment which exhibits
high IR reflectance. Such high infrared reflectance may
result in substantially less heat build up in colored
objects using the pigments.</p><p num="0011">Another aspect of the present invention is to
provide pigments which have the ability to change to a
different color when exposed to high temperatures. For
example, when surfaces containing these materials are 
subjected to high temperatures by laser marking, legible
marks are obtained.</p><p num="0012">Another aspect of the present invention is to
provide pigments which facilitate recycling of colored
ceramic or glass articles. When such colored ceramic or
glass objects are recycled, less objectionable coloration
is passed on to the recycled glass than with conventional
black colorants containing cobalt, chromium, nickel and
other elements.</p><p num="0013">Further aspects of the present invention relate
to the production of rare earth manganese oxide pigments,
substitution of other elements into these pigments, and
the use of protective or functional coatings on these
pigments in order to enhance their properties.</p><p num="0014">Another aspect of the present invention is to
provide a method of making rare earth manganese oxide
pigments. One method includes the steps of mixing rare
earth-containing and manganese-containing powders capable
of yielding metal oxides, and calcining the mixture.</p><p num="0015">These and other aspects of the present

rare earth manganese oxides as pigments. The pigments
are of the formula (Re<sub>x</sub>Mn) O<sub>y</sub>, where Re is at least one
element selected from Y, La and elements of the
Lanthanide Series of the Periodic Table, e.g., Ce, Pr,
Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu. In
the foregoing formula, x ranges from 0.01 to 99, and y
designates the number of oxygen atoms required to
maintain electroneutrality. Preferably, x ranges from
0.08 to 12, more preferably from 0.25 to 4. The value of
y is preferably greater than or equal to x+1 and less
than or equal to 2x+2. A preferred compound is of the
formula ReMnO<sub>3</sub>. However, other compounds such as ReMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
may be suitable for use as pigments. Preferred rare
earth elements include Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm. For 
many applications, particularly preferred rare earths
include Y, La, Pr and Nd.</p><p num="0018">In one embodiment of the invention in which the
rare earth element includes Y, a preferred pigment is of
the formula YMnO<sub>3</sub>. This compound is based on a
perovskite-type structure. Another suitable pigment is
of the formula YMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. It has been found that
substitutions of La, lanthanides and other dopants may
substitute for the yttrium. In addition, Fe, Ni and
other metal atoms may substitute for the manganese
constituents of the pigment.</p><p num="0019">In addition to Y-containing compounds, it has
been found that strong colorants may be formed from La or
lanthanide manganese oxide compositions. For example,
such compounds may comprise LaMnO<sub>3</sub>, CeMnO<sub>3</sub>, PrMnO<sub>3</sub>, NdMnO<sub>3</sub>
and the like. Where lanthanum, cerium or praseodymiumare
are present in the compounds, such pigments are typically
black.</p><p num="0020">The present rare earth manganese oxide pigments
typically have average particle sizes of from about 0.1
to about 20 microns, preferably from about 0.2 to about
10 microns, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 5
microns.</p><p num="0021">The rare earth manganese oxide materials of the
above-noted formula have been found to possess favorable
colorant properties. The pigments are useful in many
applications, including organic chemical compositions
such as plastics, rubbers, and the like, coating
compositions such as paints, printing inks, and the like,
and inorganic chemical compositions such as glass
enamels, porcelain enamels, and the like. </p><p num="0022">In addition to their use as colorants, the rare
earth manganese oxide pigments of the invention may
provide improved infrared reflectance and reduced heat
buildup properties. As used herein, the term "IR
reflectance" means the reflectance properties of a
material at wavelengths above about 700 nm. The IR
wavelengths include near-IR (750-2,000 nm), mid-IR
(2,000-4,000 nm) and far-IR (4,000-5,500 nm).</p><p num="0023">The rare earth manganese oxide pigments of the
present invention may be formed by processes such as
mixing and calcining, or chemical techniques such as solgel
or precipitation, which may then be followed by a
calcination step. The pigment compositions may be
formed, for example, by mixing yttrium, lanthanum and/or
lanthanide-containing powders such as oxides or
carbonates with manganese-containing powders such as
manganese carbonate, dioxide or tetroxide in the
appropriate ratio to form the desired composition,
followed by calcining. For example, a particularly
preferred process for making yttrium-manganese oxide
pigments is to mix yttrium oxide or carbonate with
manganese oxide or carbonate powders, followed by
calcination. Mixing includes the processes of milling
the pigments, either dry or wet, pulverizing, blending or
like processes, and calcining. Calcination includes all
firing processes such as calcination in periodic, tunnel,
or rotary kilns, flash calcination, spray pyrolysis and
other techniques which raise the temperature of the
material to a higher temperature to promote reaction.
The mole ratio of the yttrium oxide or carbonate to
manganese oxide or carbonate preferably ranges from about
1:10 to about 10:1, more preferably from about 1:2 to 
about 2:1. In this embodiment, the mixed powders are
preferably calcined at temperatures of from about 700 to
about 1,500¬∞C, more preferably from about 900 to about
1,300¬∞C. Calcination times of from about 1 to about 60
hours are preferred, more preferably from about 2 to
about 8 hours. For instance, 56.5 weight percent yttrium
oxide and 43.5 weight percent manganese dioxide may be
mixed and calcined at 1,200¬∞C for 4 hours to form the
pigment. The ratio of yttrium to manganese may be
adjusted in order to achieve compositions having the
desired color characteristics. Similar molar ratios and
calcination procedures may be used for other rare earth
compositions.</p><p num="0024">A full or partial coating of one or more layers
may be placed on the surface of the present pigments.
Inorganic pigment coatings are known in the art.
Examples of coating compositions which may be suitable
for use with the present pigments are disclosed in U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,851,587, 5,976,237 and 5,858,080, which are
incorporated herein by reference. Coatings may be
applied for a variety of reasons. In the case where
there is an unfavorable reaction between the surface of
the pigment and the medium where it is being used, a
protective layer is often used. These protective layers
are typically silica, alumina and other metal oxides, but
may also be other elements, compounds or organic
materials. Functional coatings may be applied in order
to change the conductivity of the surface, modify optical
properties or enhance the surface reactivity.</p><p num="0025">Exemplary coating methods include
precipitation, which is typically initiated by passing
the pH of a solution through the isoelectric point. 
Another method comprises coating the pigment particles
with a liquid that contains the coating material either
in solution or suspension, and drying the particles until
a solid coating is produced on the surface of the
pigment. Other methods known in the art may also be
used.</p><p num="0026">The pigments of the present invention may be
used as colorants for various types of substrates.
Plastic or rubber compositions to which the rare earth
manganese oxide pigments may be added in accordance with
this invention include polymeric materials that are
natural or synthetic. Examples include natural resins,
rubber, chlororubber, casein, oil-modified alkyd resins,
viscose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate,
cellulose acetobutyrate, nitrocellulose, and other
cellulose ethers or esters. Synthetic organic polymers
produced by polymerization, polyaddition or
polycondensation in thermosetting or thermoplastics can
also be colored by the present pigments. Examples are
polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene,
polyisobutylene, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylacetate,
polyacrylonitrile, poly acrylic acid and other
polyolefins and substituted polyolefins, as well as
methacrylic acid esters, butadiene and copolymers
thereof. Examples of polyaddition and polycondensation
resins are the condensation products of formaldehyde with
phenols, phenolic resins, urea, thiourea and melamine,
amino resins, polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates
and/or silicones. These polymers can be present
individually or as mixtures. The polymers may be in the
form of bulk plastic materials, pellets, fibers and the
like. </p><p num="0027">The present pigments may also be used in film
formers or binders for lacquers, paints, or printing inks
such as linseed oil, nitrocellulose, melamine resins,
acrylic resins, ureaformaldehyde resins and the like.
The present rare earth manganese oxide pigments may be
incorporated in a liquid or a paste form. Suitable
liquid carriers for the rare earth manganese oxide
pigments include pine oils, vegetable oils, mineral oils,
low molecular weight petroleum fractions, tridecyl
alcohols, synthetic resins and natural resins.</p><p num="0028">In a further embodiment, a substrate may be
coated with a glass-ceramic enamel composition, including
the present pigments and then fired. The substrate may
comprise, for example, automotive glass, architectural
glass, container glass, metal or the like.</p><p num="0029">The following examples are intended to
illustrate various aspects of the present invention, and
are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 1</u></heading><p num="0030">A pigment is made by mixing 87.0 g MnO<sub>2</sub> and
112.9 g Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in a blender, and then mixing the powder in a
hammer mill through a 0.02-inch screen. The powder
mixture is heated in a kiln to 1,200¬∞C, held at this
temperature for a period of 4 hours, and then cooled to
room temperature. The calcined powder is wet-ground for
1 hour, filtered and dried. The dry powder obtained is a
yittrium manganite phase of the formula YMnO<sub>3</sub> with a
yttrium to manganese ratio of 1:1. The powder is a blue
black pigment exhibiting high IR reflectance
characteristics. </p><p num="0031">Tint trials are prepared by mixing 2 grams of
YMnO<sub>3</sub> pigment with 7 grams of TiO<sub>2</sub> in a RPVC resin system,
with a total combined weight of 72 grams. This mixture
is dispersed on a heated two-roll mill at 420¬∞F for a
period of 3 minutes. Masstone trials are prepared by the
same method but have no TiO<sub>2</sub> additions. Measurements of
color values and reflectance percentage at a wavelength
of 1,100 nm are performed using a Datacolor CS-5. The
standard CIELAB L*a*b* system is used to define the color
of the pigment. The L* refers to the lightness of the
sample, with L*=100 designating the lightness upper limit
and L*=0 designating the darkness lower limit. The a*
describes the red or green value of the pigment, with a
positive a* value designating red, and a negative a*
value designating green. The b* value represents the
blue or yellow value, with a positive b* value
designating yellow and a negative b* value designating

Table 1, the tint sample has an L* value of less than 65, 
and the masstone sample has an L* value of less than 30.
Furthermore, the negative b* value shows the pigment in
Example 1 produces a slightly blue gray color when mixed
with the white TiO<sub>2</sub> in the tint sample, or a slightly blue
black color when used alone in the masstone sample. This
blue black color adds extra utility to the pigment
because most blue inorganic pigments require cobalt based
pigments, such as cobalt aluminate (DCMA13-26-2), to
impart a desired blue shade to gray colors. Such
conventional blue pigments, due to their cobalt content,
are not only expensive, but they often have poor infrared
reflecting characteristics between 1,200 and 1,700 nm.</p><p num="0034">Fig. 1 illustrates the improved IR reflectance
characteristics achieved with a yttrium-manganese oxide
pigment masstone sample of the present invention produced
in Example 1 in comparison with conventional pigments.
The reflectance curves of the Y-Mn-O pigment are compared
with Ni-Mn-Fe-Cr-O black pigment and carbon black in RPVC
masstone trials. The Y-Mn-O masstone sample shown in
Fig. 1 was prepared by mixing 2 grams of pigment with an
unpigmented RPVC resin, as described in Example 1. The
comparison samples were also combined with RPVC in a
similar manner. In each case the pigments were fused
into the RPVC on a two-roll mill, and then pressed flat.</p><p num="0035">As illustrated in Fig. 1, materials comprising
the present yttrium manganese oxide pigment possess
comparable color and reflectance characteristics at
visible wavelengths in comparison with the conventional
colorants, but possess markedly increased reflectance
characteristics at IR wavelengths in comparison with the
conventional pigments. Articles colored with the present
pigments, thus appear relatively dark at visible 
wavelengths and relatively light at IR wavelengths.
These reflectance characteristics are highly advantageous
in applications where heat buildup due to the absorption
of IR radiation is to be minimized.</p><p num="0036">Articles incorporating the present pigments,
such as the Y-Mn-O sample shown in Fig. 1, which exhibit
IR reflectances of greater than, e.g., 50 percent at
1,100 nm, will generally perform well in heat buildup
tests. Thermal energy from solar radiation is absorbed
at wavelengths of up to about 2,500 nm. In an embodiment
of the present invention, the rare earth manganese oxide
pigments of the present invention preferably exhibit high
IR reflectances at wavelengths of up to 2,500 nm and
above.</p><p num="0037">In addition to the masstone results illustrated
in Fig. 1, comparative tint trials were performed in
order to evaluate the color of the present Y-Mn-O pigment
and conventional pigments when mixed with a white TiO<sub>2</sub>
pigment. The tint samples were prepared as described in
Example 1 by mixing each pigment with 70 grams of resin
containing approximately 10 percent pigmentary grade TiO<sub>2</sub>.
This provides a way to evaluate the IR reflective
properties of the present pigments in comparison with
other pigments when mixed in a color formulation.</p><p num="0038">Fig. 2 illustrates the improved IR reflectance
characteristics achieved with the yttrium-manganese oxide
pigment tint sample of the present invention in
comparison with the conventional Ni-Mn-Fe-Cr-O, Cr-Fe-O
and carbon black tint samples. As illustrated in Fig. 2,
the tint sample comprising the present yttrium-manganese
oxide pigment possesses good color and reflectance
characteristics at visible wavelengths in comparison with 
the conventional colorants, but possesses substantially
increased reflectance characteristics at IR wavelengths
in comparison with the conventional pigments. As shown
in Fig. 2, reflectance values for the tint sample
containing the present Y-Mn-O pigment are above 75
percent throughout a substantial portion of the IR
region, with reflectance values above 80 percent in some
parts of the IR spectrum.</p><p num="0039">As demonstrated in Fig. 2, in tint
applications, the yttrium manganese oxide pigments
typically reflect more in one or more wavelengths in the
infrared region of the spectrum than in the visible
region of the spectrum. The amount of this reflectance
increase depends upon the amount of the pigment used
compared to other pigments in the color formulation, and
the matrix that contains these pigments. For example,
when only a small amount of pigment is added, and the TiO<sub>2</sub>
of the tint sample produces a very high reflectance in
the visible range, only small increases in the IR
reflectance is expected. When the present rare earth
manganese oxide pigments are calcined and ground for a
time of from about 1 to about 6 hours and used in RPVC
tint applications as described in the examples herein,
they are capable of achieving an IR reflectance at a
wavelength between 700 and 2,500 nm of greater than about
50 percent, preferably greater than about 60 percent.
The present pigments are more preferably capable of
achieving an IR reflectance of greater than about 70
percent in such RPVC tint applications, with an IR
reflectance of greater than about 75 or 80 percent being
particularly preferred for some of the pigments. </p><p num="0040">Another measure of the improvement in the
reflectivity in the IR region is by using the standard
Kubelka Munk scattering equation: K/S=(1-R)<sup>2</sup>/2R, where R
is the measured reflectance of the material, after
accounting for surface reflection. In the case where a
completely opaque sample is produced by adding high
scattering pigments, and effects of surface scattering
are negligible, the amount of scattering (S) may be
calculated versus the amount of absorption (K) for the
pigment itself. By applying the Kubleka Munk equation to
samples with significant amounts of pigmentary grade TiO<sub>2</sub>,
characteristic of our tint trials, and by subtracting
typically 4.5 percent from the reflectance values to
compensate for reflection at the surface of the article,
the K/S can be calculated. This calculation shows that
the K/S in the optical region is much higher or more
absorbing that in the IR regions.</p><p num="0041">A plot showing the K/S values for a YMnO<sub>3</sub>
pigment powder of the present invention with an average
particle size of about 1 micron, with the visible region
normalized to a value of 1, is shown in Fig. 3. The
present pigments preferably exhibit K/S values compared
to wavelengths in the visible region of about 50 percent
or less for at least one of the infrared wavelengths
above 800 nm, more preferably less than about 30 percent,
and most preferably less than about 15 percent.</p><p num="0042">In accordance with the present invention,
plastic, rubber, paint and other compositions
incorporating the present pigments may possess reduced
heat buildup characteristics due to the improved IR
reflectance properties. Also, various types of
substrates may be coated with the present pigments, such 
as wood, glass, ceramic, metal, plastic and composite
substrates to provide an organic coating or paint which
provides low heat buildup properties.</p><p num="0043">As shown below in Table 2, a masstone sample
comprising the YMnO<sub>3</sub> pigment produced as described in
Example 1 exhibits substantially decreased heat buildup
when subjected to IR radiation in comparison with
commercially available pigments incorporated in similar
masstone samples. The comparative pigments listed in
Table 2 are commercially available: Columbian Chemical
Co. Raven 450 (carbon black ); Cerdec 10335 (Co-Cr-Fe);
and Cerdec 10333 (Ni-Mn-Cr-Fe). The ability of the
present pigments to reduce IR-induced heat buildup has
particular significance for uses such as architectural,
automotive, military, aerospace, industrial and
electronics applications.

that the pigments of the present invention possess
favorable colorant properties in the visible spectrum.
When the pigments are calcined and ground for a time of
from about 1 to about 6 hours and used in RPVC tint
applications as described in the foregoing examples, they
are capable of achieving CIELAB L* lightness values of
less than about 65, preferably less than about 60. The
present pigments are more preferably capable of achieving
L* values of less than about 55 in such RPVC tint
applications, with an L* value of less than about 50
being particularly preferred for some of the pigments.
When the pigments are calcined and ground for a time of
from about 1 to about 6 hours and used in RPVC masstone
applications as described in the foregoing examples, they
are preferably capable of achieving CIELAB L* values of
less than about 35, more preferably less than about 30.</p><p num="0060">Another measure of pigment colorant properties
is provided in terms of strength. Pigment strength is a
measure of how much pigment is needed to produce a
desired color compared with a standard pigment, for
example, when mixed with a scattering pigment such as TiO<sub>2</sub>
in a tint application. For example, in a sample where 
twice as much pigment must be mixed with TiO<sub>2</sub> to develop
the same color as a standard pigment, such a pigment
would be half as strong as the standard pigment, or have
a stength of 50 percent. Strength can be measured by
adding pigment to samples until the color value is
similar to a standard sample, and then calculating the
strength value based upon the amount of pigment required.
For black pigments, strength values are closely related
to L* values. Stronger black pigments yield lower L*
values, while weaker black pigments yield higher L*
values. Table 11 lists strength, L*, a* and b* values
for tint samples containing a standard Cu-Cr black
pigment (Shepherd 1 Cu-Cr) in comparison with
conventional Cerdec 10333 Ni-Mn-Fe-Cr and Cerdec 10335
Co-Cr-Fe black pigments and the Y-Mn-O and Pr-Mn-O
pigments of the present invention. The Y-Mn-O pigment
listed in Table 11 was made as described in Example 4,
while the Pr-Mn-O pigment was made as described in
Example 6.

values listed in Table 11, the present rare earth
manganese oxide pigments have strengths comparable to or 
higher than conventional pigments. Many materials which
appear black may have poor pigmentary properties, hence a
relatively limited number of commercial chemistries are
currently used for black pigments even though inorganic
black compounds are quite numerous. The present rare
earth manganese oxide compounds thus possess the ability
to yield strong black colors when used as pigments.
Other properties such as gloss, or surface smoothness of
a paint film, may also be improved in comparison with
existing inorganic black pigments. The present pigments
typically have strengths of at least about 50 percent in
comparison with the standard Shepherd 1 Cu-Cr black
pigment, preferably at least about 80 percent. Some of
the present pigments have strengths of at least 100 or
120 percent compared with the standard Cu-Cr black
pigment. Such strengths may be achieved in tint
applications, as well as other applications such as
conventional ink and paint formulations modified to
include the present rare earth manganese oxide pigments.</p><p num="0062">The Pr-Mn-O samples listed in Table 10 were
characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis. Fig. 4 is
an x-ray diffraction pattern from Pr-Mn-O Sample No. 10
listed in Table 10 overlaid on the only published
compound in the standard JCPDS diffraction file
containing the elements Pr, Mn and O (35-0166, Mn1.03,
Pr0.97, 03). The peaks shown in Fig. 4 for the Pr-Mn-O
sample represent x-ray reflections at certain angular
orientations which may be described by the following
equation: nŒª=2d sinÓúç, where d=the distance between
crystal planes, Œª is the wavelength of the incident x-rays,
and Óúç is the angle of incidence where reflection
occurs. The distances between crystal planes (d 
spacings) are associated with approximate intensity
values used for identification purposes, which are
typically described in terms of relative intensity
percentages. The different peaks appearing in such x-ray
diffraction patterns are indicative of the type of
crystal structure of the sample and the d spacings of the
sample. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the Pr-Mn-O pigment of
the present invention corresponds with an x-ray
diffraction pattern having peaks which do not match the
x-ray diffraction pattern of the prior composition.
Similar x-ray diffraction trials of Pr-Mn-O Sample Nos.
11 and 12 listed in Table 10 also revealed a significant
amount of a phase which yields a similar diffraction
pattern as Pr-Mn-O Sample No. 10.</p><p num="0063">As shown in Fig. 5, the x-ray diffraction
pattern of Pr-Mn-O Sample No. 10 relates more closely to
the orthorhombic (La<sub>0.6</sub>Ca<sub>0.4</sub>)MnO<sub>3</sub> phase described in the
JCPDS diffraction file. This provides an indication that
the Pr-Mn-O samples listed in Table 10 comprise a similar
crystal structure.</p><p num="0064">The Pr-Mn-O samples listed in Table 10, which
exhibit x-ray diffraction patterns as shown in Figs. 4
and 5, have d spacings in Angstroms of approximately
2.721 (100%) and 2.728 (71%) which appear as one peak,
1.571 (24%), 1.926 (23%) and 2.222 (13%). The d spacings
may vary slightly, for example, up to about 5 percent.
The intensities listed in parentheses are approximate
values used for identification purposes and may vary
significantly for a given crystal structure.</p><p num="0065">In accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention, compounds having crystal structures and d
spacings which result in x-ray diffraction patterns 
substantially as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 have been found
to possess very favorable pigmentary properties. While
not intending to be bound by any particular theory,
pigments exhibiting such x-ray diffraction patterns
containing praseodymium and manganese seem to have very
strong colorant properties. This may be due to the
crystal structure of the compounds, as well as the fact
that multiple oxidation states may be maintained by both
the manganese and the praseodymium while still
maintaining the listed ratio of metal atoms to oxygen
atoms, i.e., Pr and Mn may be both in the 3+ state, or
may transform to the Pr4+ and Mn2+ states. This
transition may provide enhanced optical absorbtion.</p><p num="0066">The present rare earth manganese oxide pigments
possess several advantages. In some cases, use of the
present pigments is based on the fact that they have good
pigmentary properties in the visible range. They are
stable in a wide range of applications, and possess
excellent heat and weathering ability. A further
advantage of some of the present pigments is that the IR
reflectance is higher in comparison with conventional
pigments. Another advantage of the present rare earth
manganese oxide pigments is based upon their chemistry.
Typical colorants for the glass and ceramic industry may
contain copper, nickel or chromium in their formulations.
When glasses decorated with these pigments are recycled,
the aforementioned elements cause objectionable color or
physical properties in the recycled glass. However, the
present rare earth manganese oxide compounds do not
substantially discolor recycled objects, and are less of
a problem in recycled material. Therefore, due to more 
stringent recycling efforts, the present colorants can be
used where traditional colorants cannot.</p><p num="0067">Whereas particular embodiments of this
