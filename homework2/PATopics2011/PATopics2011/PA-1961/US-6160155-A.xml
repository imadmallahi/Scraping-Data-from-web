Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention is directed to a method and catalyst system for producing aromatic carbonates and, more specifically, to a method and catalyst system for producing diaryl carbonates through the carbonylation of aromatic hydroxy compounds.</p><p>2. Discussion of Related Art</p><p>Aromatic carbonates find utility, inter alia, as intermediates in the preparation of polycarbonates. For example, a popular method of polycarbonate preparation is the melt transesterification of aromatic carbonates with bisphenols. This method has been shown to be environmentally superior to previously used methods which employed phosgene, a toxic gas, as a reagent and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, as solvents.</p><p>Various methods for preparing aromatic carbonates have been previously described in the literature and/or utilized by industry. A method that has enjoyed substantial popularity in the literature involves the direct carbonylation of aromatic hydroxy compounds with carbon monoxide and oxygen. In general, practitioners have found that the carbonylation reaction requires a rather complex catalyst system. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,242, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, Chalk reports that a carbonylation catalyst system should contain a Group VIII B metal, such as ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, or a complex thereof. Further refinements to the carbonylation reaction include the identification of organic co-catalysts, such as terpyridines, phenanthrolines, quinolines and isoquinolines in U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,964 and the use of certain halide compounds, such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium halides in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,734, both patents also being assigned to the assignee of the present invention.</p><p>The economics of the carbonylation process is strongly dependent on the number of moles of aromatic carbonate produced per mole of Group VIII B metal utilized (i.e. "catalyst turnover"). Consequently, much work has been directed to the identification of efficacious inorganic co-catalysts that increase catalyst turnover. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,210, which is also assigned to General Electric Company, Joyce et al. report the use of a cobalt pentadentate complex as an inorganic co-catalyst ("IOCC"). In U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,789, Takagi et al. report the use of lead as an IOCC. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,547, Iwane et al. report the use of trivalent cerium as an IOCC. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,726,340, Takagi et al. report the use of lead and cobalt as a binary IOCC system. In Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 10-316627, Yoneyama et al. report the use of manganese and the combination of manganese and lead as IOCC's.</p><p>The literature is silent, however, as to the role of the IOCC in the carbonylation reaction (i.e. the reaction mechanism). Accordingly, meaningful guidance regarding the identification of additional IOCC systems is cursory at best. Periodic table groupings have failed to provide guidance in identifying additional IOCC's. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,554 provides a general listing of possible IOCC candidates, yet further analysis has revealed that many of the members (and combinations of members) of the recited groups (i.e., Groups IV B and V B) do not catalyze the carbonylation reaction. Therefore, due to the lack of guidance in the literature, the identification of effective carbonylation catalyst systems has become a serendipitous exercise.</p><p>As the demand for high performance plastics has continued to grow, new and improved methods of providing product more economically are needed to supply the market. In this context, various processes and catalyst systems are constantly being evaluated; however, the identities of improved and/or additional effective catalyst systems for these processes continue to elude the industry. Consequently, a long felt, yet unsatisfied need exists for new and improved methods and catalyst systems for producing aromatic carbonates and the like.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method and catalyst system for producing aromatic carbonates. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of carbonylating aromatic hydroxy compounds by contacting at least one aromatic hydroxy compound with oxygen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a carbonylation catalyst system that includes a catalytic amount of an inorganic co-catalyst containing ytterbium.</p><p>In various alternative embodiments, the carbonylation catalyst system can include an effective amount of a palladium source and an effective amount of a halide composition. Further alternative embodiments can include catalytic amounts of various co-catalyst combinations, such as ytterbium and copper; ytterbium, copper, and titanium; ytterbium, copper and iron; ytterbium and cerium; ytterbium and manganese; ytterbium, manganese, and europium; ytterbium, manganese, and bismuth; ytterbium and europium; ytterbium and nickel; ytterbium and bismuth; ytterbium and zinc; ytterbium and iron; ytterbium and cobalt; ytterbium and iridium; ytterbium and ruthenium; ytterbium and rhodium; and ytterbium and chromium.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p>Various features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent with reference to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawing, wherein the FIGURE is a schematic view of a device capable of performing an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p>The present invention is directed to a method and catalyst system for producing aromatic carbonates. In one embodiment, the method includes the step of contacting at least one aromatic hydroxy compound with oxygen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a carbonylation catalyst system that includes a catalytic amount of an inorganic co-catalyst containing ytterbium. In alternative embodiments, the catalyst system can include an effective amount of a Group VIII B metal and an effective amount of a halide composition.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, the term "effective amount," as used herein, includes that amount of a substance capable of either increasing (directly or indirectly) the yield of the carbonylation product or increasing selectivity toward an aromatic carbonate. Optimum amounts of a given reactant can vary based on reaction conditions and the identity of other constituents yet can be readily determined in light of the discrete circumstances of a given application.</p><p>Aromatic hydroxy compounds which may be used in the practice of the present invention include aromatic mono or polyhydroxy compounds, such as phenol, cresol, xylenol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, and bisphenol A. Aromatic organic mono hydroxy compounds are preferred, with phenol being more preferred.</p><p>In various preferred embodiments, the carbonylation catalyst system can contain at least one constituent from the Group VIII B metals or a compound thereof. A preferred Group VIII B constituent is an effective amount of a palladium source. In various embodiments, the palladium source may be in elemental form, or it may be employed as a palladium compound. Accordingly, palladium black or elemental palladium deposited on carbon may be used as well as palladium halides, nitrates, carboxylates, oxides and palladium complexes containing carbon monoxide, amines, phosphines or olefins. As used herein, the term "complexes" includes coordination or complex compounds containing a central ion or atom. The complexes may be nonionic, cationic, or anionic, depending on the charges carried by the central atom and the coordinated groups. Other common names for these complexes include complex ions (if electrically charged), Werner complexes, and coordination complexes.</p><p>In various applications, it may be preferable to utilize palladium (II) salts of organic acids, including carboxylates with C.sub.2-6 aliphatic acids. Palladium(II) acetylacetonate is also a suitable palladium source. Preferably, the amount of Group VIII B metal source employed should be sufficient to provide about 1 mole of metal per 800-10,000 moles of aromatic hydroxy compound. More preferably, the proportion of Group VIII B metal source employed should be sufficient to provide about 1 mole of metal per 2,000-5,000 moles of aromatic hydroxy compound.</p><p>The carbonylation catalyst system may further contain an effective amount of a halide composition, such as an organic halide salt. In various preferred embodiments, the halide composition can be an organic bromide salt. The salt may be a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt, or a hexaalkylguanidinium bromide. In various embodiments, α, ω-bis(pentaalkylguanidinium)alkane salts may be preferred. Suitable organic halide compositions include tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetraethylammonium bromide, and hexaethylguanidinium bromide. In preferred embodiments, the carbonylation catalyst system can contain between about 5 and about 1000 moles of bromide per mole of palladium employed, and, more preferably, between about 50 and about 150 molar equivalents of bromide are used.</p><p>The formation of diaryl carbonates in a carbonylation reaction can be accompanied by the formation of by-products, such as bisphenols, in varying proportions. In order to increase selectivity to diaryl carbonate, various organic co-catalysts may be incorporated in the carbonylation catalyst system. Depending on the application, suitable organic co-catalyst may include various phosphine, quinone, terpyridine, phenanthroline, quinoline and isoquinoline compounds and their derivatives, such as 2,2':6',2-terpyridine, 4'-methylthio-2,2':6',2-terpyridine, 2,2':6',2-terpyridine N-oxide, 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline and 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline.</p><p>The carbonylation catalyst system includes a catalytic amount of an inorganic co-catalyst (IOCC) containing ytterbium. In addition to ytterbium per se, it has been discovered that certain IOCC combinations can effectively catalyze the carbonylation reaction. Such IOCC combinations include ytterbium and copper; ytterbium, copper, and titanium; ytterbium, copper and iron; ytterbium and cerium; ytterbium and manganese; ytterbium, manganese, and europium; ytterbium, manganese, and bismuth; ytterbium and europium; ytterbium and nickel; ytterbium and bismuth; ytterbium and zinc; ytterbium and iron; ytterbium and cobalt; ytterbium and iridium; ytterbium and ruthenium; ytterbium and rhodium; and ytterbium and chromium.</p><p>An IOCC can be introduced to the carbonylation reaction in various forms, including salts and complexes, such as tetradentate, pentadentate, hexadentate, or octadentate complexes. Illustrative forms may include oxides, halides, carboxylates, diketones (including beta-diketones), nitrates, complexes containing carbon monoxide or olefins, and the like. Suitable beta-diketones include those known in the art as ligands for the IOCC metals of the present invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, acetylacetone, benzoylacetone, dibenzoylmethane, diisobutyrylmethane, 2,2-dimethylheptane-3,5-dione, 2,2,6-trimethylheptane-3,5-dione, dipivaloylmethane, and tetramethylheptanedione. The quantity of ligand is preferably not such that it interferes with the carbonylation reaction itself, with the isolation or purification of the product mixture, or with the recovery and reuse of catalyst components (such as palladium). An IOCC may be used in its elemental form if sufficient reactive surface area can be provided. In embodiments employing supported palladium, it is noted that the ytterbium-based IOCC provides a discrete, catalytic source of ytterbium in a form favorable for such catalysis.</p><p>IOCC's are included in the carbonylation catalyst system in catalytic amounts. In this context a "catalytic amount" is an amount of IOCC (or combination of IOCC's) that increases the number of moles of aromatic carbonate produced per mole of Group VIII B metal utilized; increases the number of moles of aromatic carbonate produced per mole of halide utilized; or increases selectivity toward aromatic carbonate production beyond that obtained in the absence of the IOCC (or combination of IOCC's). Optimum amounts of an IOCC in a given application will depend on various factors, such as the identity of reactants and reaction conditions. For example, when palladium is included in the reaction, the molar ratio of ytterbium relative to palladium at the initiation of the reaction is preferably between about 0.1 and about 100. Additional IOCC's may be used in the carbonylation catalyst system, provided the additional IOCC does not deactivate (i.e. "poison") the original IOCC.</p><p>The carbonylation reaction can be carried out in a batch reactor or a continuous reactor system. Due in part to the low solubility of carbon monoxide in organic hydroxy compounds, such as phenol, it is preferable that the reactor vessel be pressurized. In preferred embodiments, gas can be supplied to the reactor vessel in proportions of between about 2 and about 50 mole percent oxygen, with the balance being carbon monoxide. Additional gases may be present in amounts that do not deleteriously affect the carbonylation reaction. The gases may be introduced separately or as a mixture. A total pressure in the range of between about 10 and about 250 atmospheres is preferred. Drying agents, typically molecular sieves, may be present in the reaction vessel. Reaction temperatures in the range of between about 60 preferred. Gas sparging or mixing can be used to aid the reaction.</p><p>In order that those skilled in the art will be better able to practice the present invention reference is made to the FIGURE, which shows an example of a continuous reactor system for producing aromatic carbonates. The symbol "V" indicates a valve and the symbol "P" indicates a pressure gauge.</p><p>The system includes a carbon monoxide gas inlet 10, an oxygen inlet 11, a manifold vent 12, and an inlet 13 for a gas, such as carbon dioxide. A reaction mixture can be fed into a low pressure reservoir 20, or a high pressure reservoir 21, which can be operated at a higher pressure than the reactor for the duration of the reaction. The system further includes a reservoir outlet 22 and a reservoir inlet 23. The gas feed pressure can be adjusted to a value greater than the desired reactor pressure with a pressure regulator 30. The gas can be purified in a scrubber 31 and then fed into a mass flow controller 32 to regulate flow rates. The reactor feed gas can be heated in a heat exchanger 33 having appropriate conduit prior to being introduced to a reaction vessel 40. The reaction vessel pressure can be controlled by a back pressure regulator 41. After passing through a condenser 25, the reactor gas effluent may be either sampled for further analysis at valve 42 or vented to the atmosphere at valve 50. The reactor liquid can be sampled at valve 43. An additional valve 44 can provide further system control, but is typically closed during the gas flow reaction.</p><p>In the practice of one embodiment of the invention, the carbonylation catalyst system and aromatic hydroxy compound are charged to the reactor system. The system is sealed. Carbon monoxide and oxygen are introduced into an appropriate reservoir until a preferred pressure (as previously defined) is achieved. Circulation of condenser water is initiated, and the temperature of the heat exchanger 33 (e.g., oil bath) can be raised to a desired operating temperature. A conduit 46 between heat exchanger 33 and reaction vessel 40 can be heated to maintain the desired operating temperature. The pressure in reaction vessel 40 can be controlled by the combination of reducing pressure regulator 30 and back pressure regulator 41. Upon reaching the desired reactor temperature, aliquots can be taken to monitor the reaction.</p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>The following examples are included to provide additional guidance to those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention.
