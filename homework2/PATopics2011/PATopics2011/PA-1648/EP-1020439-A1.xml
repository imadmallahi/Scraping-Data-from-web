comprises as an active ingredient a compound having a bis-(2-aminophenyl)
disulfide structure or a 2-amino-phenylthio structure
and more particularly to a pharmaceutical composition for treating
or preventing atherosclerosis or hyperlipidemia. This invention
also relates to a compound having a bis-(2-aminophehyl) disulfide

pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrates or solvates of these
compounds.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND ART</u></heading><p num="0002">From the results of many epidemiological studies, it has been
considered that there exists certain relation between
atherosclerotic diseases and serum lipoprotein. For example,
Badimon et al. (J. Clin. Invest. <u style="single">85</u>, 1234-1241 (1990)) reported that
not only the prevention of development but also regression of
atherosclerotic lesions were observed after intravenous injection
of fractions containing HDL (high density lipoprotein) and VHDL (very
high density lipoprotein) to cholesterol-loaded rabbits. Thus,
regarding the relation between atherosclerotic diseases and serum
lipoproteins, it is expected that HDL and VHDL may have
antiatherosclerotic activity.</p><p num="0003">Recently, it has been elucidated that there are proteins that
transfer lipids among serum lipoproteins, i.e., CETP (cholesterol
ester transfer protein). The presence of CETP was first indicated
by Nichols and Smith in 1965 (J. Lipid Res. <u style="single">6</u>, 206 (1965)). cDNA of
the protein was later cloned by Drayna et al. in 1987. Molecular
weight of the protein as glycoprotein is 74,000 Da. It is about 58,000
Da after complete removal of sugar chain. cDNA of this protein is
composed of 1656 nucleotide residues and codes for 476 amino acids
following signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. Since around 44% 
of these amino acids are hydrophobic, the protein is highly
hydrophobic and liable to be inactivated by oxidation. CETP is
synthesized in organs like liver, spleen, adrenal, fat tissue, small
intestine, kidney, skeletal muscle, and myocardium. It has been
confirmed that CETP is synthesized in cells like macrophages derived
from human monocytes, B lymphocytes, fat cells, small intestinal
epithelial cells, CaCo<sub>2</sub> cells, and liver cells (for example, HepG2
cells derived from human hepatoma cells). In addition to these
tissues, it is present in cerebrospinal fluid and seminal fluid, too.
The presence is also confirmed in culture media of neuroblastoma and
neuroglioma cells, and in chorioid plexus of sheep.</p><p num="0004">It has become apparent that CETP participates in metabolism
of all the lipoproteins <i>in vivo</i> and plays important roles in reverse
transfer system of cholesterol. It attracted attention as a system
that prevents the accumulation of cholesterol into peripheral cells
and functions as protective mechanism against atherosclerosis. In
relation to HDL, which plays important roles in the reverse transfer
system of cholesterol, a great number of epidemiological studies have
shown that a decrease in CE (cholesterol esters) of HDL in blood
represents one of the risk factors for coronary artery diseases.
Activity of CETP differ depending on the species of animals and it
has become apparent that cholesterol load does not bring about
atherosclerosis in animals with low CETP activity, while it is easily
produced in animals with high CETP activity. Absence of CETP results
in high HDL-emia + low LDL (low density lipoprotein)-emia and brings
about a state resistant to atherosclerosis. Thus, the importance of
CETP as mediators of transfer of CE in HDL to blood LDL has become
recognized in addition to the importance of HDL in blood.</p><p num="0005">Free cholesterol (FC) synthesized in the liver and secreted
therefrom is taken up into very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Next,
VLDL is metabolized in the blood to LDL via intermediate density
lipoprotein (IDL) by the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and liver
triglyceride lipase (HTGL). LDL is taken up to peripheral cells
mediated by LDL receptor and, thus, FC is supplied to the cells.</p><p num="0006">Contrary to this flow from the liver to peripheral cells, there
exists another flow of cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver 
called cholesterol reverse transfer system. FC accumulated in
peripheral cells is extracted by HDL, esterified on HDL through the
action of LCAT (Lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase) to form CE,
transferred to the hydrophobic core portion of HDL, and HDL becomes
matured to globular HDL particles. CE in HDL is transferred to
apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, IDL, and LDL by CETP
present in the blood. In exchange, TG is transferred to HDL in mole
ratio of 1:1. CE that is transferred to apoB-containing lipoprotein
is taken up by the liver via LDL receptor on it and, thus, cholesterol
is transferred indirectly to the liver. There is mechanisms, too,
by which HDL becomes CE-rich, apoprotein E-containing HDL by taking
up apoprotein E secreted by macrophages and the like, which is then
taken up directly to the liver via LDL receptor or remnant receptor.
In another, the liver cells do not take up HDL particles, but take
up selectively only CE in HDL. In still another, HDL particles are
taken up by the liver cells via so-called HDL receptor.</p><p num="0007">In a state, in which CETP activity is augmented, CE in HDL is
decreased and CE in VLDL, IDL and LDL is increased due to augmentation
of CE transfer from HDL. Increases in uptake of IDL and LDL to the
liver result in down-regulation of LDL receptor and increases in LDL
in the blood. In contrast, in a state of CETP deficiency, HDL removes
cholesterol from peripheral cells with the aid of LCAT, increases
its size gradually and acquires apoE. HDL that becomes apoE-rich is
taken up by the liver via LDL receptor of the liver and catabolized.
However, as the operation of this mechanism is not adequate in the
human, retention of large HDL in the blood occurs and, as a result,
cholesterol pool in the liver becomes smaller. LDL receptor becomes
up-regulated and LDL is decreased.</p><p num="0008">Hence, by selectively inhibiting CETP, it is possible to
decrease IDL, VLDL, and LDL that accelerate atherosclerosis and
increase HDL that exhibits inhibitory action. Thus, it is
anticipated that hitherto non-existent drugs useful for prevention
or therapy of atherosclerosis or hyperlipidemia may be provided.</p><p num="0009">Very recently there have been reports on chemical compounds
that aim at inhibition of such CETP activity.</p><p num="0010">For example, in Biochemical and Biophysical Research 
Communications <u style="single">223</u>, 42-47 (1996), dithiodipyridine derivatives and
substituted dithiobenzene derivatives are disclosed as compounds
capable of inactivating CETP through modification of cysteine
residues. However, the literature neither discloses nor suggests the
compounds such as those of the present invention which have a
bis-(2-aminophenyl) disulfide structure or a 2-aminophenylthio
