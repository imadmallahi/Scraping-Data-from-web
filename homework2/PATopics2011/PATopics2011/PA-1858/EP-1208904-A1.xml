structure and a method of preparing the same, and more specifically, it
relates to a substance separation structure provided with a permeable
membrane formed on a porous base material having continuous holes and a
method of preparing the same.</p><p num="0002">A gas permeation membrane is put into practice in the field of
oxygen enrichment, nitrogen enrichment, carbon dioxide separation,
hydrogen separation and the like. An oxygen enrichment membrane or a
nitrogen enrichment membrane concentrating oxygen or nitrogen contained
in the air is employed for combustion or medical application. A carbon
dioxide separation membrane separating methane and carbon dioxide
contained in natural gas from each other is employed for recovering carbon
dioxide. A hydrogen separation membrane is used for separating and
recovering gaseous hydrogen employed for desulfurizing petroleum.</p><p num="0003">Gaseous hydrogen, employed as the fuel for a fuel cell or the like, is
industrially prepared by denaturation of gaseous fuel or the like.
According to the denaturation of gaseous fuel, for example, gaseous
hydrogen is prepared by reforming steam, while the reformed gas contains
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and the like as subcomponents in addition
to the main component of hydrogen. When the reformed gas is applied to
the fuel for a fuel cell as such, for example, the performance of the cell is
deteriorated. Therefore, the reformed gas must be purified for removing
the subcomponents other than hydrogen and obtaining high-purity gaseous
hydrogen. The reformed gas may be purified by a method utilizing the
characteristic of a hydrogen-permeable membrane selectively permeating
only hydrogen.</p><p num="0004">Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 11-267477 (1999) proposes a
method of forming a hydrogen-permeable metal film such as a Pd film or an 
Nb film of about 0.1 to 20 µm in thickness on a surface of a porous support
of stainless steel or ceramics such as alumina or silicon nitride by ion
plating, in order to prepare a hydrogen-permeable membrane having no
pinholes.</p><p num="0005">The hydrogen permeability of such a hydrogen-permeable membrane
is in inverse proportion to the thickness thereof, and hence the thickness of
the hydrogen-permeable membrane must be reduced to the utmost in order
to improve the hydrogen permeability. When a hydrogen-permeable
membrane of not more than 1 µm in thickness is formed on a surface of a
porous base material by ion plating, however, it is impossible to form a
dense membrane having no pinholes. Therefore, a hydrogen-permeable
membrane sufficiently improved in hydrogen permeability cannot be
prepared.</p><p num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a substance
separation structure capable of forming a hydrogen-permeable membrane
of not more than 1 µm in thickness on a surface of a porous base material
as a dense membrane having no pinholes with high hydrogen permeability
and durability, and a method of preparing the same.</p><p num="0007">The inventor has made various studies on membrane forming
methods, to find out that a dense membrane having no pinholes can be
prepared by polishing a surface of a porous base material with abrasive
grains containing a porous material and thereafter forming a permeable
membrane.</p><p num="0008">On the basis of this recognition, a substance separation structure
according to an aspect of the present invention comprises a base material
including a porous material having a continuous hole with an opening of
the hole formed on at least one surface, a porous layer, formed to fill up the
opening formed on at least one surface of the base material, having a hole
smaller than the hole of the base material, and a permeable membrane of
not more than 1 µm in thickness formed on at least one surface of the base
material formed with the porous layer to selectively permeate ions or
neutral elements or molecules, while the surface roughness of at least one 
surface of the base material formed with the porous layer is not more than
0.3 µm in Rmax.</p><p num="0009">In the substance separation structure according to the present
invention, the surface of the base material is flattened to the surface
roughness of not more than 0.3 µm in Rmax while the opening of the hole
formed on the surface of the base material is filled up with the porous layer,
whereby the permeable membrane of not more than 1 µm in thickness can
be formed on the surface of the base material in a dense state with no
pinholes. Thus, permeability of the permeable membrane can be improved.</p><p num="0010">In the substance separation structure according to the present
invention, the ratio (Tb/Ta) of the mean thickness Tb of a portion of the
porous layer formed on the surface of the base material outside the hole of
the base material to the mean thickness Ta of a portion of the porous layer
formed in the hole of the base material is set to at least 0 and not more
than 1, thereby improving adhesion between the permeable membrane and
the surface of the base material. Thus, durability of the substance
separation structure can be improved.</p><p num="0011">Preferably, the porous material forming the base material is at least
one material selected from a group consisting of ceramics, a metal and a
complex of the ceramics and the metal.</p><p num="0012">More preferably, the porous material forming the base material is
porous silicon nitride having porosity of at least 30 % and not more than
70 %.</p><p num="0013">Further preferably, the porous material forming the base material
includes at least one material selected from a group consisting of iron and
nickel, and has porosity of at least 60 % and not more than 95 %.</p><p num="0014">In the substance separation structure according to the present
invention, the permeable membrane may not be porous. Preferably, the
permeable membrane is made of a metal, an alloy or a compound
containing at least one material selected from a group consisting of
palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), gold (Au), silver (Ag), niobium (Nb),
tantalum (Ta), vanadium (V) and zirconium (Zr). More preferably, the
permeable membrane is formed by a single layer or a plurality of layers. 
Further preferably, the permeable membrane is made of a compound
having a zeolite structure or a perovskite structure.</p><p num="0015">Preferably, the surface roughness of at least one surface of the base
material not yet formed with the porous layer is not more than 0.3 µm in
Rmax. More preferably, the surface roughness of at least one surface of
the base material formed with the porous layer and the permeable
membrane is not more than 0.3 µm in Rmax.</p><p num="0016">A method of preparing a substance separation structure according to
another aspect of the present invention comprises steps of polishing a
surface of a base material including a porous material having a continuous
hole with an opening of the hole formed on at least one surface with
abrasive grains containing a porous material to be capable of filling up the
opening with a porous layer and forming a permeable membrane of not
more than 1 µm in thickness by plating or ion plating on the surface of the
base material formed with the porous layer by the polishing.</p><p num="0017">Preferably in the method according to the present invention, the
porous material forming the base material is at least one material selected
from a group consisting of ceramics, a metal and a complex of the ceramics
and the metal.</p><p num="0018">Preferably, the abrasive grains containing the porous material
contain at least one material selected from a group consisting of porous
aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. More preferably, the average
diameter of the abrasive grains containing the porous material is smaller
than the average diameter of the opening formed on at least one surface of
the base material.</p><p num="0019">In the method according to the present invention, arc ion plating is
preferably employed as the ion plating.</p><p num="0020">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of
the present invention will become more apparent from the following
detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction
with the accompanying drawings, provided by way of example.</p><p num="0021">Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view showing a substance separation 
structure according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p num="0022">As shown in Fig. 1, a substance separation structure 10 according to
the present invention comprises a base material 1, a porous layer 2 formed
to fill up openings 11 provided on at least one surface of the base material 1
and a permeable membrane 3 of not more than 1 µm in thickness provided
on at least the surface of the base material 1 formed with the porous layer 2.
The base material 1 consists of a porous material having a number of
continuous holes (not shown) communicating with the openings 11, and the
porous layer 2 has holes (not shown) smaller than those of the base
material 1. The permeable membrane 3 is formed to selectively permeate
ions or neutral elements or molecules. The surface roughness of at least
the surface of the base material 1 formed with the porous layer 2 is not
more than 0.3 µm in Rmax.</p><p num="0023">In an embodiment of the substance separation structure according to
the present invention, a permeable membrane of not more than 1 µm in
thickness is formed on a surface of a porous silicon nitride base material
flattened to have surface roughness of not more than 0.3 µm in Rmax by
polishing with abrasive grains containing a porous material. The abrasive
grains containing a porous material are preferably prepared from those
containing grains of γ-aluminum oxide (γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) grains. It is preferable to
employ aluminum oxide abrasive grains having an average diameter
smaller than the average diameter of openings of holes formed on the
surface of the silicon nitride base material. The material for the
permeable membrane can be prepared from any of metals such as
palladium, platinum, gold, silver, vanadium, niobium, tantalum and
zirconium or an alloy or a compound containing any of these metals.</p><p num="0024">On the flattened surface of the silicon nitride base material, the
porous aluminum oxide layer is formed on the portions of the holes. The
porous aluminum oxide layer consists of portions <u style="single">A</u> formed in the holes of
the silicon nitride base material and portions B formed on the surface of the
silicon nitride base material outside the holes, and the ratio (Tb/Ta) of the
mean thickness Tb of the portions B to the mean thickness Ta of the 
portions <u style="single">A</u> is at least 0 and not more than 1. High adhesion is attained
between the permeable membrane formed on the surface of the base
material and the base material. Therefore, the permeable membrane is
not separated from the base material but maintains a dense state with no
pinholes when purifying hydrogen-containing gas. Thus, gas other than
hydrogen can be remarkably inhibited from passing through the permeable
membrane, and high-purity gaseous hydrogen can be obtained.</p><p num="0025">The permeable membrane is formed on the surface of the porous base
material by plating or ion plating. While ion plating includes various
types of methods and any method is applicable to the present invention, arc
ion plating (arc discharge ion plating) is particularly preferably employed.</p><p num="0026">While a palladium film, for example, has excellent hydrogen
permeability for serving as the permeable membrane, (100) planes of
palladium crystals exhibit lower hydrogen permeability than the remaining
crystal planes. When a palladium film is so formed as to orient palladium
crystals on (111) planes, superior hydrogen permeability can be attained as
compared with a palladium film having no such orientation. According to
the inventive method, a palladium film is formed on a surface, flattened by
polishing with abrasive grains containing a porous material, of a porous
base material having continuous holes by arc ion plating with application
of a bias voltage so that palladium crystals are oriented in (111) planes,
whereby excellent hydrogen permeability can be attained.</p><p num="0027">Porous silicon nitride employed for the base material of the inventive
substance separation structure preferably has network hole portions
formed by columnar β-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> crystal grains intertwined with each other.
The porosity of the porous silicon nitride is preferably within the range of
30 to 70 %, particularly preferably within the range of 40 to 50 %. Further,
the bending strength of the porous silicon nitride base material is
preferably within the range of 30 to 450 MPa, and particularly preferably
within the range of 200 to 450 MPa.</p><p num="0028">The hydrogen permeability of the permeable membrane is in inverse
proportion to the thickness thereof such that the hydrogen flux through a
membrane having a thickness of 1 µm is 10 times that of a membrane 
having a thickness of 10 µm, for example. When the hydrogen flux is
increased to 10 times, the surface area of the membrane necessary for
attaining the same hydrogen flux is reduced to 1/10. When the thickness
of the permeable membrane is reduced to 1/10, therefore, the necessary
weight of the membrane is reduced to 1/100. According to the present
invention, therefore, a dense permeable membrane having excellent
hydrogen permeability can be formed with a thickness of not more than 1
µm, whereby a compact substance separation structure having high
performance can be prepared at a low cost.</p><p num="0029">When the surface of the porous base material is polished with
nonporous diamond grains, the hole portions of the porous base material
remain as cavities on the surface and hence the surface roughness exceeds
1 µm in Rmax. Consequently, the permeable film of not more than 1 µm in
thickness cannot be formed on the surface of the base material in a state
with no pinholes.</p><p num="0030">When the porous layer is formed on the surface of the porous base
material having continuous holes by a sol-gel method or the like, the mean
thickness Ta of the portions <u style="single">A</u> of the porous layer formed in the holes of the
base material is reduced below the mean thickness Tb of the portions B of
the porous layer formed on the surface of the base material outside the
holes. In other words, the ratio (Tb/Ta) of the mean thickness Tb of the
portions B to the mean thickness Ta of the portions <u style="single">A</u> exceeds 1. When the
permeable membrane is formed on the surface of the base material treated
in this manner, adhesion between the permeable membrane and the base
material is reduced. Therefore, the permeable membrane is separated
from the base material when purifying hydrogen-containing gas.</p><heading>(Example 1)</heading><p num="0031">A porous silicon nitride sintered body having surface roughness of
about 2.0 µm in Rmax was prepared as the base material for a substance
separation structure. A surface of the aforementioned porous silicon
nitride sintered body was polished with aluminum oxide abrasive grains of
0.05 µm in mean grain size, to be flattened. The mean pore diameter of
the porous silicon nitride sintered body was 0.3 µm. The aluminum oxide 
abrasive grains contained 15 mass % of α-aluminum oxide grains and 85
mass % of γ-aluminum oxide grains. The polished porous silicon nitride
base material exhibited surface roughness of 0.3 µm in Rmax. The surface
roughness was measured with a tracer type surface roughness tester
(measurement resolution: 0.01 µm) provided with a tracer having a radius
R of 100 µm on the forward end. The ratio (Tb/Ta) of the mean thickness
Tb of the portions B of the aluminum oxide layer formed on the surface of
the silicon nitride base material outside the holes of the silicon nitride base
material to the mean thickness Ta of the portions <u style="single">A</u> formed in the holes of
the silicon nitride base material was 0.1.</p><p num="0032">An arc ion plating apparatus was used for forming a permeable
membrane on the surface of the porous silicon nitride base material treated
in the aforementioned manner. Palladium was set on a target in a
chamber of the arc ion plating apparatus as the material for the permeable
membrane, at a distance of 300 mm from the base material. The pressure
in the chamber of the arc ion plating apparatus was set to 2.66 x 10<sup>-3</sup> Pa (2
x 10<sup>-5</sup> Torr), and the arc ion plating apparatus was driven with a bias
voltage of -400 V and an arc current of 80 A. Thus, a palladium film of 1.0
µm in thickness was formed on the surface of the base material.</p><p num="0033">No pinholes were observed on the surface of the obtained palladium
film. In this film, palladium crystals were oriented and grown on (111)
planes.</p><p num="0034">The substance separation structure prepared in the aforementioned
manner was employed for purifying hydrogen-containing gas at a
temperature of 500°C. In this case, the palladium film was not separated
from the base material but maintained a dense state with no pinholes.
Thus, it was possible to remarkably suppress gas other than hydrogen from
