No. 3,282,729]. Alkali metal polysilicates have long been known as protective coatings that modify the permeability or surface characteristics of polymeric films and other articles [See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,007,482; 1,424,425; 1,949,914; 3,102,038; 3,130,061; 3,180,747; 3,492,137; 3,522,066; 3,533,816 and 3,706,603].</p><p>Lithium (Li), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) polysilicate are used in coatings for a variety of surfaces. For example, Hecht and Iler, Canadian Patent No. 993,738, describe a gas and liquid-impermeable coating for polymeric substrates comprising lithium polysilicate having a mole ratio of SiO.sub.2 to Li.sub.2 O of between about 1.6 and 4.6.</p><p>Although alkali metal polysilicate barrier coatings do provide excellent vapor, gas and aroma barrier properties to coated articles, the authors have found that some metal polysilicate barrier coatings display reduced oxygen barrier performance at relative humidities greater than about 60 percent. Additionally, polymeric films coated with said alkali metal polysilicate barrier coatings exhibit reduced barrier performance when subjected to repeated flexing.</p><p>Additionally, polymeric articles are known to become hazy after certain polysilicate coatings have been incorporated. The tendency of sodium polysilicate coatings to effloresce, i.e., to become covered by powdery crystalline material as a result of atmospheric exposure, has been documented [Weldes and Lange, Ind. Eng. Chem., 61(4):28-44 (1969)]. This characteristic has similarly been observed for lithium polysilicate coatings by the present inventors. In contrast, pure potassium polysilicate coatings do not effloresce, but suffer severe loss of barrier performance above 50 percent relative humidity. Pure lithium polysilicate coatings, on the other hand, exhibit little to no loss of barrier performance over the same relative humidity range.</p><p>Vermiculite, a layered silicate, has also been employed as an ingredient in coatings of various types. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,704 refers to so-called 2:1 layered silicates, where the silicates are selected from mica and vermiculite. W. J. Ward et al, J. Membrane Science, 55:173-180 (1991) suggests vermiculite may provide the basis for a variety of improved coatings for films. It is stated that vermiculite could be used in a sprayed-on high barrier coating for low barrier plastics. U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,729 refers to a polymeric film having a coating layer which comprises vermiculite platelets. See, also, U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,050 and European patent applications No. 92305329.2, published Dec. 16, 1992 as EP No. 518,647 and 92305330.0, published Dec. 16, 1992 as EP No. 518,646.</p><p>Although layered silicates, including vermiculite, are known to form stable aqueous suspensions, these suspensions are also known to become destabilized in the presence of dissolved metal cations, such as those present in alkali metal polysilicates. Such destabilization results in flocculation of the layered silicates and reduces their efficacy in vapor, gas and aroma barrier applications.</p><p>There remains a need in the art for barrier coatings which overcome these deficiencies in prior art coatings.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In one aspect, the present invention provides a vapor barrier coating solution for polymeric articles comprising a layered inorganic mineral filler dispersed in an inorganic binder. In a desirable embodiment, the filler is a layered silicate and the binder is an alkali metal polysilicate. The weight fraction of the layered silicate in the dried coating ranges from above 0 to about 99 percent.</p><p>In a preferred aspect, a vapor barrier coating solution for polymeric articles comprises vermiculite dispersed in a solution of aqueous lithium polysilicate, wherein the weight fraction of the layered silicate in the dried coating ranges from above 0 to about 99 percent.</p><p>In still another aspect, the invention provides a polymeric article, such as a film or bottle, coated with the coating solutions described above. The polymer may be a polyolefin, a polyester, or a polyamide, and may be biaxially oriented.</p><p>In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of coating a polymeric article comprising the steps of (a) dispersing a layered inorganic mineral filler, e.g., a layered silicate in an inorganic binder, such as an aqueous alkali metal polysilicate suspension in an amount sufficient to create a suspension wherein the weight fraction of layered inorganic filler in the inorganic components of the dried coating from above 0 to about 99 percent, (c) coating the article using standard coating technology, d) drying the coated article, and (e) optionally laminating the barrier coated article. The coating, when dried, provides a high vapor barrier to the article.</p><p>In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing resistance of a barrier coating to loss of barrier properties due to flexing by incorporating into the barrier coating solution a layered, inorganic mineral filler with a high aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspects and advantages of the present invention are described in the detailed description below and in the claims.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention overcomes the deficiencies in prior art barrier coatings by providing a coating solution containing a layered inorganic mineral filler and an inorganic binder which provide high vapor barrier capability and flex resistance. Preferably, the coating solution comprises a metal polysilicate and layered silicate, which, when dried, provides excellent barrier characteristics, especially at high relative humidity in comparison with coatings containing only metal polysilicates. The vapor barrier coating solution of the present invention may be applied to any polymeric article.</p><p>A. Definitions</p><p>The term "vapor" implies a liquid at partial pressure, such as water vapor. The term "gas" includes oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and others. "Aroma" includes those materials which bear a fragrance, for example, menthol and others. For simplicity, as used herein, the term "vapor barrier" can be interpreted to mean a barrier to gases and aromas as well as traditionally defined vapors.</p><p>Similarly as used herein, the term "solution" is interpreted to include colloidal dispersions and suspensions. By "colloidal dispersion or suspension" is meant any dispersion or suspension of particles in liquid, the particles being of a size greater than molecular scale that do not settle out. Generally the particle size in a suspension or dispersion of this invention are from about 10 to about 50,000 Angstroms. "Coating solution" as used herein is meant a liquid containing dissolved or suspended solids that do not settle out and which is used to apply said solids to a substrate.</p><p>B. Layered Inorganic Mineral Fillers</p><p>Useful layered fillers for the present invention include silicate materials such as phyllosilicates. Illustrative of such materials are smectite clay minerals such as bentonite, montmorillonite, nontronite, beidellite, volkonskoite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadiite, and kenyaite, vermiculite, and the like. Other useful layered materials include illite minerals such as ledikite and admixtures of illites with the clay minerals named above.</p><p>Other useful layered inorganic materials are layered double hydroxides, such as Mg.sub.6 Al.sub.3,4 (OH).sub.18.8 (CO.sub.3).sub.1.7 H.sub.2 O (see W. T. Reichle, J. Catal., 94:549 (1985), which have positively charged layers and exchangeable anions in the interlayer spaces. Other layered materials having little or no charge on the layers may be useful in this invention provided they can be intercalated with swelling agents which expand their interlayer spacing. Such materials include chlorides such as ReCl.sub.3 and FeOCl, chalcogenides such as TiS.sub.2, MoS.sub.2, and MOS.sub.3, cyanides such as Ni(CN).sub.2, and oxides such as H.sub.2 Si.sub.2 O.sub.5, V.sub.6 O.sub.13 , HTiNbO.sub.5, Cr.sub.0.5 V.sub.0.5 S.sub.2, W.sub.0.2 V.sub.2.8 O.sub.7, Cr.sub.3 O.sub.8, MoO.sub.3 (OH).sub.2, VOPO.sub.4 --2H.sub.2 O, CaPO.sub.4 CH.sub.3 --H.sub.2 O, MnHAsO.sub.4 --H.sub.2 O, Ag.sub.6 Mo.sub.10 O.sub.33, and the like. Preferred swellable layered materials are phyllosilicates of the 2:1 type having a negative charge on the layers ranging from about 0.25 to about 0.9 charges per formula unit and a commensurate number of exchangeable cations in the interlayer spaces. See, other layered materials described in International Patent Application No. PCT/US92/06733, published on Mar. 4, 1993 as WO93/04118.</p><p>A typical coating solution according to this invention may be prepared from commercially available layered silicates, preferably vermiculite. An exemplary commercially available aqueous dispersion of exfoliated vermiculite with a solids level of 7.5 percent by weight bears the trademark MicroLite particles of this layered silicate are typically about 24-50 Angstroms thick and 10-22 microns in diameter, and thus possess very large aspect ratios, i.e., the quotient of the lateral dimension of a platelet filler particle divided by its thickness.</p><p>C. Inorganic Binders--Metal Polysilicates</p><p>Solid metal polysilicates have intrinsic permeability much lower than organic polymers, making them attractive binder materials for thin barrier coatings containing layered mineral particles. The metal polysilicate is generally selected from lithium polysilicate, sodium polysilicate, potassium polysilicate or copolysilicate blends of these materials. In the present coating solutions, where layered silicates are employed, flocculation of the silicate platelets must be avoided. This requirement places stringent restrictions on the formulation of a barrier coating solution containing layered silicates and metal polysilicates.</p><p>Layered silicates have isoelectric points (iep), i.e., the pH at which the zeta potential is zero, of about 2.5. Layered silicates form stable sols at the high pH, about pH 10, of metal polysilicate barrier coating solutions. This stability can be compromised by cations that accumulate in the Stern layer, reduce the zeta potential of the particles and thereby lower the coulombic repulsion barrier to flocculation. The effectiveness of cations in causing flocculation is expressed as the critical flocculation concentration. This is the concentration above which flocculation is rapid. Divalent and trivalent metals cause flocculation at very low concentrations; they must be avoided in the coating solutions of the present invention. For example, W. R. Grace product literature recommends that "all additives to MicroLite in nature." Additionally, the same product literature lists the critical flocculation concentration for sodium ions in the presence of MicroLite inventions that employ layered silicates in water soluble polymers or latexes adhere to this recommendation, the present invention does not. A typical coating solution of the present invention contains added lithium far in excess of the critical flocculation concentration. For example, a 7.5 weight percent solids coating solution, that when dried yields a coating comprising 20 weight percent lithium polysilicate (SiO.sub.2 :Li.sub.2 O=4.05) and 80 weight percent Microlite vermiculite (see Example 2 below), contains 110 mmole/liter added lithium ion. While lithium ion is expected to be less destabilizing than sodium ion, the concentration of lithium ion in the above coating suspension is greater than what would be expected by one skilled in the art to result in a stable suspension.</p><p>Other factors, such as resistance of the metal polysilicate to efflorescence on exposure to atmospheric CO.sub.2, favor the use of potassium polysilicate in a metal polysilicate coating solution. Potassium ion, however, would be expected by one skilled in the art to have a critical flocculation concentration similar to that of sodium.</p><p>Thus, where the layered silicate is vermiculite, which is susceptible to flocculation by cations, the preferred alkali metal polysilicate is lithium polysilicate. However, the formulation of a metal polysilicate coating solution containing dispersed vermiculite must be a compromise to balance solution stability and the other dried coating properties described above. One of skill in the art may adjust the relative ratios of the metal polysilicate to the layered silicate to achieve this-balance in properties of the coating solutions.</p><p>A typical coating solution according to this invention may be prepared from commercially available metal polysilicates, such as lithium polysilicate, sodium polysilicate and/or potassium polysilicate solutions. An exemplary commercially available product bearing the trademark Inobond (van Baerle &amp; Cie AG) is an aqueous colloidal suspension of lithium polysilicate which contains ˜24.5 percent by weight silicon dioxide and ˜3.0 percent by weight lithium oxide. Another useful metal polysilicate product bears the trademark K-4009 (van Baerle &amp; Cie AG) and is an aqueous colloidal suspension containing ˜26.8 percent by weight silicon dioxide and ˜13 percent by weight potassium oxide.</p><p>D. Optional Surfactants</p><p>These coating compositions can also contain a suitable surfactant to reduce surface tension. Preferably, the surfactant is nonionic. The surfactant selected should possess a critical micelle concentration sufficiently low to ensure a dried coating whose gas, vapor and aroma barrier properties are not compromised. Most preferably, the surfactant is selected from the group consisting of acetylenic diols and alkyl ethoxylates. One exemplary commercially available acetylinic diol bears the trademark Genapol 26-L-60N (Hoechst Celanese). Two exemplary commercially available alkyl ethoxylates bear the trademarks Genapol Dynol coating composition will depend on the particular surfactant selected, but should be the minimum amount of surfactant that is necessary to achieve the uncompromised dried coating. For example, typical surfactant amounts can be less than 0.1 percent by weight of an acetylenic diol or an alkyl ethoxylate.</p><p>E. Method of the Invention</p><p>The layered silicate-metal polysilicate coatings of the invention can be used on a variety of polymeric articles, polymeric films, polymeric sheets, rigid and semi-rigid polymeric containers and other surfaces to improve (i.e., reduce) the gas permeability of the products. These coatings are particularly advantageous where the polymers used to prepare these articles do not provide sufficient vapor, gas or aroma impermeability for the desired application. Such polymers include polyesters, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET); polyolefins, particularly polypropylene, polyethylene and cycloolefins (COC), such as a copolymer of ethylene and norbornene [U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,677]; and polyamides, such as nylon. Typically, polypropylene and PET films are biaxially oriented, depending on the customer requirements. Especially preferred articles for coating with compositions of the present invention include polymeric films, bottles, jars, blisterpacks, and sheets commonly used in the food industry, containers and lidstocks, made of the foregoing polymers.</p><p>A typical coating solution according to this invention may be prepared from the above-described commercially available products. For instance, MicroLite lithium polysilicate or K-4009 polysilicates, are mixed with water to produce a colloidal suspension having a desired solids content. One can also prepare the coating solutions of the invention by using the "parent" products which are used to produce the commercially available polysilicates, but such preparation is well-known and unnecessary in view of the commercial availability of the lithium and potassium polysilicate solutions.</p><p>A typical useful solids content in the coating solution ranges from about 2 percent to about 10 percent by weight of solids. The desired solids content of the solution depends on the coating method used, as well as the specific coating formulation, and may be adjusted to achieve a thickness of between about 100 to about 500 nm of the dry coating. Preferably, where the components of the coating solution are vermiculite and lithium polysilicate, the solids content is between about 2 and about 8 percent by weight. Such an adjustment is well within the skill of the art [see, e.g., Canadian Patent No. 993,738].</p><p>After a period of stirring, a surfactant may be optionally added to reduce surface tension of the coating mixture. The barrier coating mixture is then ready to be applied to a polymeric surface. Conventional coating techniques, such as roll coating, spray coating, brush coating and dip coating, may be used. These techniques include, but are not limited to, roll, rod, reverse roll, forward roll, air knife, knife over roll, blade, gravure and slot die coating methods. General descriptions of these types of coating methods may be found in texts, such as Modern Coating and Drying Techniques, (E. Cohen and E. Gutoff, eds; VCH Publishers) New York (1992) and Web Processing and Converting Technology and Equipment, (D. Satas, ed; Van Nostrand Reinhold) New York (1984). Three dimensional articles may preferably be coated by spray coating or dip coating methods, among others. The method of application is not a limitation on the present invention, but may be selected from among these and other well-known methods by the person of skill in the art.</p><p>The polymeric articles to be coated by the compositions of the invention may be previously untreated. Optionally, the polymeric article, such as a film or bottle, may be first plasma treated to improve wetting and adhesion by the barrier coating as described in the following Example 1. Alternatively, the polymeric article may be corona-treated by the industry-wide corona discharge treatment method. In instances where corona-treatment of the polymer does not cause suitable wetting of the coating on the polymer, a suitable primer may be first applied to the polymeric article. For example, in the case of polypropylene, a primer solution of poly(vinyl alcohol) or poly(hydroxystyrene) may be used to improve wetting of the polymer. The polymeric article or surface may also be flame treated or chemically etched or oxidized prior to the application of a primer solution or, alternatively, prior to the application of the coating solution of this invention.</p><p>Alternatively, the article may bear on at least one surface or side, a heat seal layer. Examples of such heat seal layers are an ethylene-propylene copolymer or ethylene-propylene-butylene terpolymer.</p><p>Exemplary polyolefin substrates used in the examples below are the FND xx and SCM xx grade biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films produced by Trespaphan GmbH. The number, xx, refers to the film thickness in micrometers; thus FND 30 is a 30 μm (or 1.2 mil) thick BOPP film. These films are designed to be metallized by thermal or electron-beam evaporation of aluminum. FND and SCM grade BOPP films are three-layer laminates with thin heat-sealable layers on both sides. One side of the film is corona treated at the factory to a surface energy of 36-39 dynes/cm to improve adhesion of aluminum. Supplemental corona treatment, immediately before applying a primer solution, was found to be beneficial even for these films that were corona treated at the factory. Similar commercially available polypropylene films that will be suitable in the present invention include AQS, MT BASE, and MVT BASE films (AET Packaging Films). These all have a heat seal layer on one side only and, in the case of AQS, a high energy treated surface for waterborne coatings. These are all intended to be coated on the side opposite from the heat seal layer.</p><p>Alternatively, the polymeric substrate may have a protective topcoat or laminate layer, such as polyurethane or Teflon [DuPont]. Such topcoats or laminates may be selected by one of skill in the art, depending on the substrate and its intended use. The coating mixture of this invention may be applied over or under such additional layers.</p><p>After coating the article, the resultant product must be dried at a selected temperature at or above room temperature. The selection of the drying temperature depends on the desired time for drying. Accelerated drying times may be achieved at elevated temperatures which would not be necessary if a longer time period for drying was acceptable. However, one of skill in the art can readily adjust the oven temperature and exposure time as desired. The performance of the dried barrier coating is insensitive to the drying temperature throughout the temperature range between about 25 to about 200</p><p>The coating solutions according to this invention yield a dried coating that is substantially transparent at a thickness of less than 500 nm, the clarity improving with increased metal polysilicate fraction. These solutions provide a high vapor barrier capability, when dried, and are characterized by enhanced flex resistance on the coated article.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><p>The following examples illustrate the preferred coating solutions and methods of the invention.
