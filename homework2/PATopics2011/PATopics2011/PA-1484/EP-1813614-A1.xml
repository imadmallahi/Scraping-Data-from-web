In most cases, the full cytotoxic potential of the drugs could only be observed, however, if the drug molecules could be released from the conjugates in unmodified form at the target site.</p><p num="p0005">One of the cleavable linkers that has been employed for the preparation of antibody-drug conjugates is an acid-labile linker based on cis-aconitic acid that takes advantage of the acidic environment of different intracellular compartments such as the endosomes encountered during receptor mediated endocytosis and the lysosomes. Shen and Ryser introduced this method for the preparation of conjugates of daunorubicin with macromolecular carriers (<nplcit id="ncit0019" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>102 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1048-1054 (1981</text></nplcit>)). Yang and Reisfeld used the same technique to conjugate daunorubicin to an anti-melanoma antibody (<nplcit id="ncit0020" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>80 J. Natl. Canc. Inst. 1154-1159 (1988</text></nplcit>)). Dillman et al. also used an acid-labile linker in a similar fashion to prepare conjugates of daunorubicin with an anti-T cell antibody (<nplcit id="ncit0021" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>48 Cancer Res. 6097-6102 (1988</text></nplcit>)).</p><p num="p0006">An alternative approach, explored by Trouet et al, involved linking daunorubicin to an antibody via a peptide spacer arm (<nplcit id="ncit0022" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>79 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 626-629 (1982</text></nplcit>)). This was done under the premise that free drug could be released from such a conjugate by the action of lysosomal peptidases.</p><p num="p0007"><i>In vitro</i> cytotoxicity tests, however, have revealed that antibody-drug conjugates rarely achieved the same cytotoxic potency as the free unconjugated drugs. This suggested that mechanisms by which drug molecules<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> are released from the antibodies are very inefficient. In the area of immunotoxins, conjugates formed via disulfide bridges between monoclonal antibodies and catalytically active protein toxins were shown to be more cytotoxic than conjugates containing other linkers. See, <nplcit id="ncit0023" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Lambert et al, 260 J. Biol.

This was attributed to the high intracellular concentration of glutathione contributing to the efficient cleavage of the disulfide bond between an antibody molecule and a toxin. Despite this, there are only a few reported examples of the use of disulfide bridges for the preparation of conjugates between drugs and macromolecules. <nplcit id="ncit0026" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Shen et al (260, J. Biol. Chem. 10905-10908 (1985</text></nplcit>)) described the conversion of methotrexate into a mercaptoethylamide derivative followed by conjugation with poly-D-lysine via a disulfide bond. Another report described the preparation of a conjugate of the trisulfide containing toxic drug calicheamycin with an antibody (<nplcit id="ncit0027" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Hinman et al., 53 Cancer Res. 3336-3342 (1993</text></nplcit>)).</p><p num="p0008">One reason for the lack of disulfide linked antibody-drug conjugates is the unavailability of cytotoxic drugs possessing a sulfur atom containing moiety that can be readily used to link the drug to an antibody via a disulfide bridge. Furthermore, chemical modification of existing drugs is difficult without diminishing their cytotoxic potential.</p><p num="p0009">Another major drawback with existing antibody-drug conjugates is their inability to deliver a sufficient concentration of drug to the target site because of the limited number of targeted antigens and the relatively moderate cytotoxicity of cancerostatic drugs like methotrexate, daunorubicin, and vincristine. In order to achieve significant cytotoxicity, linkage of a large number of drug molecules, either directly to the antibody or through a polymeric carrier molecule, becomes necessary. However, such heavily modified antibodies often display impaired binding to the target antigen and fast <i>in vivo</i> clearance from the blood stream.</p><p num="p0010">In spite of the above-described difficulties, useful cytotoxic agents comprising cell binding moieties and the group of cytotoxic drugs known as<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> maytansinoids have been reported (<patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5208020A" status="new"><text>USP 5,208,020</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5416064A" status="new"><text>USP 5,416,064</text></patcit>, and <nplcit id="ncit0028" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>R. V. J. Chari, 31 Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 89-104 (1998</text></nplcit>)). Similarly, useful cytotoxic agents comprising cell binding moieties and analogues and derivatives of the potent antitumor antibotic CC-1065 have also been reported (<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5475092A" status="new"><text>USP 5,475,092</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5585499A" status="new"><text>USP 5,585,499</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6756397B" status="new"><text>USP 6,756,397</text></patcit>).</p><p num="p0011">Tomaymycin derivatives are pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs), a known class of compounds exerting their biological properties by covalently binding to the N2 of guanine in the minor groove of DNA. PBDs include a number of minor groove binders such as anthramycin, neothramycin and DC-81. Tomaymycin antitumor activity is however limited because of its non-specific toxicity towards normal cells. Thus there is a need to increase the therapeutic activity, and diminish the non-specific toxic effects of tomaymycin compounds. The present inventors have shown that this need can be met by targeted delivery of tomaymcin compounds by linking them to cell binding agents. Additionally, there is a need to develop tomaymycin derivatives that are soluble and stable in aqueous solutions. Further, tomaymycin is not sufficiently potent to be used in conjugates of cell binding agents.</p><p num="p0012">Recently, a few new PBD derivatives and their anti-tumour activity in preclinical models have been disclosed (<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO0012508A" status="new"><text>WO 00/12508</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO2005085260A" status="new"><text>W02005/085260</text></patcit>). However, initial clinical trials in humans indicate that this class of compounds are severely toxic, based on the very low dose that can be administered to humans (I. Puzanov, Proc. AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference, Philadelphia, USA 2005, Abstract #B117). Thus, it is desired to provide alternative derivatives that are more potent and/or may be bonded to cell binding agents.</p><p num="p0013">Accordingly, a method of treating diseases with tomaymycin derivatives wherein their side effects are reduced without compromising their cytotoxicity is greatly needed.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="p0014">As disclosed in a first embodiment, one object of the present invention is to provide tomaymycin derivatives that are highly toxic and that can still be effectively used in the treatment of many diseases.</p><p num="p0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide novel tomaymycin derivatives, optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding agent.</p><p num="p0016">In a second embodiment, the present invention provides a therapeutic composition comprising:
<ol><li>(A) an effective amount of one or more tomaymycin derivatives optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding agent, and</li><li>(B) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient</li></ol>
In a third embodiment, the present invention provides a method of killing selected cell populations comprising contacting target cells or tissue containing target cells, with a cytotoxic amount of a cytotoxic agent comprising one or more tomaymycin derivatives, optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding agent.</p><heading><u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="p0017">This invention is based on the synthesis of novel tomaymycin derivatives that retain high cytotoxicity and that can be effectively linked to cell binding agents. It has previously been shown that the linkage of highly cytotoxic drugs to antibodies using a cleavable link, such as a disulfide bond, ensures the release of fully active drugs inside the cell, and such conjugates are cytotoxic in an antigen specific manner (<patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6340701B" status="new"><text>US 6,340,701</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US6372738B" status="new"><text>US 6,372,738</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US6436931B" status="new"><text>US 6,436,931</text></patcit>). However, the art reveals that it is extremely difficult to modify existing drugs without diminishing their cytotoxic potential. The disclosed invention overcomes this problem by modifying the disclosed tomaymycin derivatives with chemical moieties. As a result, the disclosed novel tomaymycin derivatives preserve, and in some cases could even enhance the cytotoxic potency of tomaymycin<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> derivatives. The cell binding agent-tomaymycin derivative complexes permit the full measure of the cytotoxic action of the tomaymycin derivatives to be applied in a targeted fashion against unwanted cells only, therefore, avoiding side effects due to damage to non-targeted healthy cells. Thus, the invention provides useful agents for the elimination of diseased or abnormal cells that are to be killed or lysed such as tumor cells (particularly solid tumor cells).</p><p num="p0018">The cytotoxic agent according to the present invention comprises one or more tomaymycin derivatives, optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding agent via a linking group. The linking group is part of a chemical moiety that is covalently bound to a tomaymycin derivative through conventional methods. In a preferred embodiment, the chemical moiety can be covalently bound to the tomaymycin derivative via a disulfide bond.</p><p num="p0019">The tomaymycin derivatives useful in the present invention have the formula (I) shown below:

Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by standard techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation, recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral centers.</p><p num="p0052">Compounds of the present invention may be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts.

Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see <nplcit id="ncit0033" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>T.W. Greene and P. G. M.

There is no particular restriction on the nature of the base to be used in this reaction, and any base conventionally used in reactions of this type may equally be used here, provided that it has no adverse effect on other parts of the molecule. Examples of suitable bases include: sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride; alkyllithium compounds, such as methyllithium and butyllithium; and alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p num="p0055">Usually, reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent. A variety of solvents may be used, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or on the reagents involved. Examples of suitable solvents include: hydrocarbons, which may be aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene; amides, such as dimethylformamide; alcohols such as ethanol and methanol and ethers, such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran.</p><p num="p0056">The reactions can take place over a wide range of temperatures. In general, we find it convenient to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 0°C to 150°C (more preferably from about room temperature to 100°C). The time required for the reaction may also vary widely, depending on many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents. However, provided that the reaction is effected under the preferred conditions outlined above, a period of from 3 hours to 20 hours will usually suffice.</p><p num="p0057">The compound thus prepared may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, the compounds may be recovered by distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture or, if necessary after distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture, pouring the residue into water followed by extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent and distilling off the solvent from the extract. Additionally, the product can, if desired, be further purified by various well known techniques, such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or the various chromatography techniques, notably column chromatography or preparative thin layer chromatography.</p><p num="p0058">The process of preparation of a compound of formula (I) of the invention is a further object of the present invention.</p><p num="p0059">According to a first aspect, the process of preparation of the compounds of formula (I) comprises the step of deprotecting corresponding compounds of formula (III):<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --><chemistry id="chem0005" num="0005"><img id="ib0009" orientation="unknown" wi="109" img-format="tif" img-content="chem" file="imgb0009.tif" inline="no" he="35"/></chemistry>
