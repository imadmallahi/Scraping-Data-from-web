Chemokines play an important r61e in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two main groups exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C, or α) and Cys-Cys (C- C, or β) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single amino acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity.</p><p num="p0005">The C-X-C chemokines include several potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2).</p><p num="p0006">The C-C chemokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP- 1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RA TES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxin and the macrophage inflammatory proteins lα and lβ (MTP-lα and MlP-lβ).</p><p num="p0007">Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemokines are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.</p><p num="p0008">Histamine is a basic amine, 2-(4-imidazolyl)-ethylamine, and is formed from histidine by histidine decarboxylase. It is found in most tissues of the body, but is present

in high concentrations in the lung, skin and in the gastrointestinal tract. At the cellular level inflammatory cells such as mast cells and basophils store large amounts of histamine. It is recognised that the degranulation of mast cells and basophils and the subsequent release of histamine is a fundamental mechanism responsible for the clinical manifestation of an allergic process. Histamine produces its actions by an effect on specific histamine G- protein coupled receptors, which are of three main types, HI, H2 and H3. Histamine HI antagonists comprise the largest class of medications used in the treatment of patients with allergic disorders, especially rhinitis and urticaria. Antagonists of HI are useful in controlling the allergic response by for example blocking the action of histamine on post- capillary venule smooth muscle, resulting in decreased vascular permeability, exudation and oedema. The antagonists also produce blockade of the actions of histamine on the HI receptors on c-type nociceptive nerve fibres, resulting in decreased itching and sneezing.</p><p num="p0009">Niral infections are known to cause lung inflammation. It has been shown experimentally that the common cold increases mucosal output of eotaxin in the airways. Instillation of eotaxin into the nose can mimic some of the signs and symptoms of a common cold. (See, Greiff L et al Allergy (1999) 54(11) 1204-8 [Experimental common cold increase mucosal output of eotaxin in atopic individuals] and Kawaguchi M et al Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. (2000) 122 S 1 44 [Expression of eotaxin by normal airway epithelial cells after virus A infection].)
