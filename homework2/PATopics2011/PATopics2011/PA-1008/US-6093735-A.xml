More specifically, the present invention relates to selective Î².sub.3 adrenergic receptor agonists useful in the treatment of Type II diabetes and obesity.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The current preferred treatment for Type II, non-insulin dependent diabetes as well as obesity is diet and exercise, with a view toward weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. Patient compliance, however, is usually poor. The problem is compounded by the fact that there are currently no approved medications that adequately treat either Type II diabetes or obesity. The invention described herein is directed toward an effective and timely treatment for these serious diseases.</p><p>One therapeutic opportunity that has recently been recognized involves the relationship between adrenergic receptor stimulation and anti-hyperglycemic effects. Compounds that act as Î².sub.3 receptor agonists have been shown to exhibit a marked effect on lipolysis, thermogenesis and serum glucose levels in animal models of Type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes.</p><p>The Î².sub.3 receptor, which is found in several types of human tissue including human fat tissue, has roughly 50% homology to the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptor subtypes yet is considerably less abundant. The importance of the Î².sub.3 receptor is a relatively recent discovery since the amino-acid sequence of the human receptor was only elucidated in the late 1980's. A large number of publications have appeared in recent years reporting success in discovery of agents that stimulate the Î².sub.3 receptor. Despite these recent developments, there remains a need to develop a selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonist which has minimal agonist activity against the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors. In addition, indolylpropanolamines have been disclosed by Beedle et. al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,761.</p><p>The present invention provides compounds which are selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonists. As such, the compounds effectively lead to an increase in insulin sensitivity and are useful in treating Type II diabetes and other ailments implicated by the Î².sub.3 receptor, without cardiac or tremor-related side effects.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention encompasses novel compounds described by Formula I below. ##STR2## wherein: X.sub.1 is --OCH.sub.2 --, --SCH.sub.2 --, or a bond;</p><p>R.sub.1 is a fused heterocycle of the formula: ##STR3## R.sub.2 and R.sub.3 are independently H, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, or aryl;

Schemes 1 and 2 describe methodology for the preparation of final embodiments of the present invention. Schemes 3-5 describe methodology for the preparation of intermediates required for the construction of the final embodiments of the invention. ##STR22##</p><p>In Scheme I, X.sub.1, X.sub.2, R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.4, R.sub.5, and R.sub.6 have the same meaning as previously described. The reaction of Scheme I is carried out under conditions appreciated in the art for the amination of epoxides. For example, the epoxide (A) may be combined with the amine (B) in an alcohol, preferably, ethanol at room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably, the reaction is carried under conditions generally described in Atkins et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 27:2451 (1986). These conditions include mixing the reagents in the presence of trimethylsilyl acetamide in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), tetrahydrofuran (THF), or other polar aprotic solvents in which the reagents are soluble. Preferably, the solvent is DMSO. The reaction is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 0</p><p>Some of the compounds of the present invention are prepared by a novel combinatorial/parallel synthesis. This synthesis is described in Scheme II. ##STR23##</p><p>In Scheme II, X.sub.1, X.sub.2, R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 have the same meaning as previously described. R.sub.6 is H. The reaction of Scheme II is preferably carried out by adding to a glass vial: a non-reactive solvent such as methanol, DMF, methylene chloride or acetonitrile, amine (IV), and ketone (V). The solution is shaken to allow for imine formation and treated with Amberlite IRA400 borohydride resin (Aldrich). The slurry is then shaken an additional 24 hours to effect reduction to the secondary amine. Methylene chloride and polystyrene-linked benzaldehyde resin (Frechet, J. M. et al., J. Am Chem. Soc, 93:492 (1971)) is added to the vial, in order to scavenge excess primary amine starting material. The slurry is shaken, preferably overnight. The slurry is then filtered through a cotton plug, and the residual solids rinsed with methanol. Evaporation under a flow of air, followed by drying for several hours at room temperature in a vacuum oven yields the desired product of sufficient purity.</p><p>A modification of Scheme II is necessary when the amine hydrochloride salt is used. Addition of resin-bound base to the initial reaction mixture prior to reduction or scavenging allows the desired reaction to proceed. Imine formation using amine hydrochloride salts, an aldehyde or ketone, and a resin bound amine base may be carried out using two different resins: poly(4-vinylpyridine), commercially available from Aldrich, and resin (VIII), synthesized by the reaction of Merrifield resin with piperidine (Scheme IIa): ##STR24## In Scheme IIa, PS is polysytrene. Both the poly(4-vinylpyridine) and resin (VIII) promote imine formation.</p><p>Scheme II can also be carried out by utilization of traditional fashion. Reductive aminations described in scheme II are well known in the art. They are typically performed by mixing the amine and ketone starting materials in a solvent and adding a reducing agent. Solvents typically include lower alcohols, DMF, and the like. A wide variety of reducing agents can be utilized, most commonly utilized are sodium borohydride and sodium cyanoborohydride. The reaction is typically performed at room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Products are isolated by techniques well known in the art.</p><p>The ketone and amino starting materials of Scheme II can be prepared by techniques recognized and appreciated by one skilled in the art. The synthesis of the starting materials is generally described in Schemes III and IV. ##STR25##</p><p>In Scheme III, R.sub.1 is the same as previously defined. R.sub.13 is OH or SH. Equimolar amounts of the aromatic compound (Compound IX) and (2S)-(+)-glycidyl 3-nitrobenzenesulfonate (Compound X) are dissolved in an inert solvent such as acetone and treated with 1.1 equivalents of a non-reactive acid scavenger, such as K.sub.2 CO.sub.3. The suspension is then heated at reflux for 16-20 hours with stirring. The solvent is removed in vacuo. The residue is partitioned between chloroform or other organic solvent and water. The organic layer is dried over Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4 and concentrated in vacuo to give the epoxide (XI) in sufficient purity (&amp;gt;95%) and yield (85-100%).</p><p>The epoxide (XI) is dissolved in an alcohol, preferably methanol, and treated with one equivalent of dibenzylamine. The solution is preferably stirred at reflux for three to four hours and then cooled to ambient temperature. Approximately 10 equivalents of ammonium formate are added to the flask, followed by 10% palladium on carbon, and the suspension stirred vigorously at reflux for 30-45 minutes. The reaction mixture is then filtered through Celite, concentrated in vacuo to a minimum volume and treated with 1.1 equivalents of a 1.0 M anhydrous solution of HCl in ether. The solution is concentrated to dryness. The solid residue is triturated with pentane to yield products of sufficient purity (&amp;gt;97%) and yield (60-100%). If desired, further purification may be carried out by passing over a short plug of silica, eluting with CHCl.sub.3, then 95:5 CHCl.sub.3 /MeOH, the 25:5:1 CHCl.sub.3 /MeOH/NH.sub.4 OH.</p><p>Alternatively, the epoxide (XI) is treated with a solution of methanol saturated with ammonia gas and stirred at room temperature in a sealed tube for 16 hours. This solution is then evaporated, and the residue subjected to standard purifications such as column chromatography or recrystallization. The HCl salt is then optionally produced by the addition of HCl gas in ether.</p><p>The reaction of Scheme III is further described in Beedle et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,761 and reference cited therein. U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,761 is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p>The ketone moieties of Scheme II, that are either unknown in the art or not commercially available, are prepared in accordance with Scheme IV. ##STR26##</p><p>In Scheme IV, R.sub.4 and R.sub.5 are the same as previously defined. The notation ---- indicates optional branching. Preferably, R.sub.4 is a substituted phenyl. The reaction described in Scheme IV is referred to as a Heck reaction and is described in A. J. Chalk et al., J. Org. Chem. 41: 1206 (1976). The reaction is achieved by treating compound (XIII) with an arylpalladium reagent. The arylpalladium reagent is generated in situ by treating Compound (XIV) with a palladium-triarylphosphine complex. The reaction is generally carried out in under conditions appreciated in the art.</p><p>Additional amines, of the type where X.sub.2 is methylene, R.sub.4 is aryl, and R.sub.10 is aryl, heterocycle, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heterocycle, that are reacted in a manner analogous to Scheme I are prepared in accordance with Scheme V. ##STR27##</p><p>Compounds of formula (XVII) can be prepared by reacting arylalkyl alcohols of formula (XVI) with excess (5 mol/equiv) of a compound of formula (XVIA) by methods well known in the art. (see Sh. Prikl. Kin., Vol 45, 1573-77 (1972); Russ). The reaction can also be carried out by mixing the reagents in an aprotic solvent, preferably diglyme, and adding potassium L-butoxide (0.5 mol/equiv.). The reaction is then heated to reflux and water removed. After removal of water is complete, generally 2-8 hours depending upon the scale of the reaction, the resulting solution is subjected to aqueous workup including acidic washes and the product is isolated by crystallization. Compounds of formula (XVIII) can be prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding compounds of formula (XVII) over a precious metal catalyst. The hydrogenation can be affected at between 20 and 60 psi of hydrogen, and with a variety of solvents, temperatures, and catalysts well known in the art. The reaction is preferably carried out at 50 psi of hydrogen over 5% palladium on carbon wetted with 2B3 ethanol. Compound (XVII) is charged to the reactor along with one equivalent of acetic acid, diluted with methanol, heated to 50 degrees  subjected to hydrogen for 5-24 hours depending on the scale of the reaction. The product is isolated as the acetic acid salt upon work up by methods well known in the art,</p><p>A skilled artisan would appreciate that compounds of the formula (XVIII) could be coupled with a wide variety of aromatic halides to yield the claimed ethers. The coupling can be carried out according to procedures well known in the art and is preferably performed by mixing the starting materials in N,N-dimethylacetamide and toluene in the presence of potassium carbonate. The reaction is then heated to reflux for 5 to 24 hours and water removed.

If solubility was a problem, acetonitrile/methanol or DMF was used. To each column of vials in the grid was added 50 Î¼mol of amine hydrochloride, one amine hydrochloride (or amine) (from preparations 1 through 16, or commercially available) per column, as a stock solution in methanol (0.5M, 100 Î¼l). To each vial was then added resin VIII (18-20 mg), 1.01 meq/g, 70-90 Î¼eq base). Teflon lined caps were then placed on each vial. The slurries were then shaken for 24 hours, at which time each vial was treated with approximately 30 mg (2.5 mmol BH.sub.4 -/g resin, 75 Î¼mol) of Amberlite IRA400 borohydride resin (Aldrich Chemical). The caps were replaced, and the vials were shaken for an additional 24 hours, then 150 Î¼l methylene chloride and 40 mg (1 mmol/g resin, 0.4 mmol) polystyrene-linked benzaldehyde resin (Frechet, J. M.; Schuerch, C. J. Am. Chem, Soc. 1971, 93, 492.) in order to scavenge excess primary amine starting material were added to the vial, and the slurry was shaken for 1 day Each vial was then filtered through a cotton plug. The residual resin was rinsed with three small portions of methanol (approximately 200 Î¼l). The resulting solutions were then treated with 20 Î¼l of conc. HCl (120 Î¼mol) to ensure formation of the HCl salt of the product amine, then each vial was diluted to a volume of approximately 4 mL, and 1 mL of each solution was transferred to a tared 4 mL screw cap vial. This solution was allowed to evaporate in a fume hood under an air stream until dry, then placed in a vacuum oven for 24 hours at room temperature. The resulting residues were then weighed and submitted directly for testing with no further purification. The bulk of the material (75%) was similarly evaporated.</p><p>The following matrices list additional examples 2-201. These compounds were prepared using combinatorial/parallel techniques in accordance with the present invention.

Incubation was stopped by heating suspension in boiling water. cAMP or cGMP in these and the soleus incubations were assayed by RIA (Amersham).</p><p>The compounds of the invention are agonists of the 3 receptor. Isoproterenol is accepted in the art as a non-selective 3 agonist and is widely used as a comparator in evaluating the activity of compounds. See Trends in Pharm. Sci. 15: 3 (1994). In the Functional Agonist Î².sub.3 assay, the compounds demonstrated at least 30%, preferably 50% and most preferably over 85% of isoproterenol's response at a single dose of 50 Î¼mol. Dose response titrations on the agonists described reveal EC.sub.50 values of &amp;lt;10 Î¼M, preferably &amp;lt;1 mmol. In the functional assay, dose titration furnishes an EC.sub.50 for isoproterenol of 1.1.+-î5 Î¼M.</p><p>When screened against the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors in the functional assay, dose titration experiments indicate that greatly reduced or no receptor stimulation is observed with the compounds of the invention. This is defined by measuring the intrinsic activity (maximal response achieved) as compared to isoproterenol. The claimed compounds of Formula I are selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonists and have an intrinsic activity of &amp;lt;3% of isoproterenol's response.</p><p>Thus, the compounds of the invention are selective Î².sub.3 adrenergic receptor agonists.</p><p>As agonists of Î².sub.3, the compounds are useful in treating conditions in a mammal in which the Î².sub.3 receptor has been demonstrated to play a role. The prefered mammal of treatment is a human. The relationship between modulating the Î².sub.3 receptor and treatment of diseases, such Type II diabetes and obesity, is well established in the art. Other conditions recognized in the art include: gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal motility, asthma, and depression.
