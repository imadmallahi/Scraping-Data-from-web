tire tread and a pneumatic tire comprising the rubber composition, more
specifically a rubber composition for a tire tread, which is excellent in
abrasion resistance, fuel efficiency and wet grip performance, and a
pneumatic tire comprising the rubber composition.</p><p num="0002">Natural rubber has excellent raw rubber strength (green
strength) compared to synthetic rubber and is excellent in processability.
Also, natural rubber has high mechanical strength and excellent
abrasion resistance as vulcanized rubber and therefore is frequently
used in large tires such as truck/bus tires. However, because natural
rubber only has methyl groups with a small molecular weight in the side
chains and has a low glass transition temperature (Tg) of -50°C, grip
performance is poor. For this reason, diene synthetic rubber is
frequently used in automobile tires.</p><p num="0003">In recent years, concern is rising over rise in oil prices and
exhaustion of oil due to problems of supply. Also, from the viewpoint of
environmental problems such as tightening regulations for resource
conservation and prevention of carbon dioxide exhaust, natural
resources are being reconsidered. The tire industry is not an exception
and as an alternative material of synthetic rubber, natural rubber is
attracting attention again. In order to use natural rubber as an
alternative material of synthetic rubber, improving fuel efficiency and
grip performance without losing the excellent properties of natural 
rubber is an urgent task.</p><p num="0004">Conventionally, carbon black is used as a rubber reinforcing
agent. However, in recent years, in view of social demands for energy
and resource conservation, particularly to economize fuel consumption
of automobiles, low heat generating properties in a rubber composition
are also in demand. In order to decrease heat generating properties in a
rubber composition, filling with a small amount of carbon black or using
carbon black with a large particle size can be considered, but there is the
problem that reinforcement properties and abrasion resistance
decrease.</p><p num="0005">To solve this problem, the method of using silica as a filler to
decrease heat generating properties in a rubber composition is known
and up to the present, many patent applications have been filed
regarding such a method (JP-A-3-252431). However, particles of silica
tend to coagulate due to hydrogen bonds of silanol groups, which are
surface functional groups. As a result, there are problems such as
dipersability of the silica in rubber becomes low, the Mooney viscosity
becomes high and processability, for example when extruding, is poor.</p><p num="0006">To solve this problem, a silane coupling agent is developed.
The silane coupling agent bonds with the silanol groups and prevents
coagulation of silica, improving processability. Also, in terms of
performance, as a result of the silane coupling agent chemically bonding
with silica and the polymer, rolling resistance is thought to decrease and
abrasion resistance is thought to improve. In order to achieve such
goals, silica and the silane coupling agent must be chemically reacted
during kneading and thoroughly kneading at a high temperature is
considered to be favorable to sufficiently react silica and the silane 
coupling agent. However, the functional group portion of the silane
coupling agent, which reacts with rubber, reacts with some of the rubber
due to the temperature during processing such as kneading and the
phenomenon of scorching known as gelation occurs. When kneading is
conducted at a low temperature at which scorching does not occur, the
reaction of silica and the silane coupling agent is insufficient.</p><p num="0007">As another prior art, compounding a plasticizer, obtained by
depolymerizing deproteinized natural rubber, to a rubber product in
order to decrease the hysteresis loss of the rubber component is known
(JP-A-9-249716). However, in a tire, improvement is desired in fuel
efficiency and wet grip performance, without decreasing properties such
as processability and mechanical strength.</p><p num="0008">Also, as a method for preparing modified natural rubber,
which is modified with high efficiency, and providing modified natural
rubber which does not cause allergies, known is the art relating to
modified natural rubber, which is subjected to deproteinizing treatment
and graft-copolymerization treatment with an organic compound having
an unsaturated bond (Japanese Patent No. 3294903). However, an
example of using such modified rubber as a rubber composition for a tire
tread, with the purpose of improving fuel efficiency and wet grip
performance, is not known.</p><p num="0009">The present invention aims to provide a rubber composition
for a tire tread, which is excellent in abrasion resistance, fuel efficiency
and wet grip performance, without losing properties such as
processability and mechanical strength, and a pneumatic tire 
comprising the rubber composition.</p><p num="0010">The present invention relates to a rubber composition for a
tire tread comprising 100 parts by weight of a rubber component
containing at least 5 % by weight of natural rubber graft-copolymerized
with an organic compound having an unsaturated bond and/or
epoxidized natural rubber, and 5 to 150 parts by weight of carbon black
and/or silica with a nitrogen-absorbing specific surface area of 100 to
300 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p><p num="0011">In the rubber composition for a tire tread, a silane coupling
agent is preferably contained in an amount of 1 to 20 % by weight of the
silica.</p> <p num="0012">In the rubber composition for a tire tread, protein within the
natural rubber is preferably contained in an amount of at most 0.10 %
by weight converted to nitrogen content.</p><p num="0013">In the rubber composition for a tire tread, the silane coupling
agent preferably fulfills the following formula (1)
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">(C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>-Si-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>-S<sub>1</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>-Si-(C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>O)<sub>3</sub></st32:che>
(in said formula (1), n is an integer of 1 to 3, m is an integer of 1 to 4, 1 is
an integer of 2 to 8 and the average value of 1 is 2.1 to 3.5).</p><p num="0014">The present invention also relates to a pneumatic tire
comprising the rubber composition as a tread.</p><p num="0015">The rubber composition for a tire tread of the present
invention comprises modified natural rubber in the rubber component 
and a specific amount of carbon black and/or silica. The modified
natural rubber in the rubber composition for a tire tread of the present
invention is natural rubber graft-copolymerized with an organic
compound having an unsaturated bond and/or epoxidized natural
rubber.</p> <p num="0016">When the modified natural rubber is natural rubber graft-copolymerized
with an organic compound having an unsaturated bond,
examples of the organic compound are a vinyl monomer, vinylidene
monomer, vinyl aromatic monomer and vinylidene aromatic monomer.
More specifically, examples are methacrylic acids and acrylic acids such
as methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, ethyl
methacrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, i-butyl methacrylate, tert-butyl
methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, octyl
methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, cetyl methacrylate, stearyl
methacrylate, oleyl methacrylate, benzyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate,
glycerol methacrylate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate,
i-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate,
octyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, cetyl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, oleyl
acrylate, benzyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl
acrylate, glycidyl acrylate and glycerol methacrylate and derivatives
thereof, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, acrylamide, styrene, α-methylstyrene
and vinyl pyrrolidone. Also, a reactive monomer having
at least two vinyl groups within a molecule can be used. Examples of a
monomer having at least two vinyl groups within a molecule are a
difunctional acrylic monomer such as allyl methacrylate, glycerol
dimethacrylate, 1,3-butanediol dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol 
dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate and tetraethylene
glycol diacrylate, and a difunctional vinyl monomer such as
divinylbenzene. Of these, from the viewpoint that reactivity of the
monomer is excellent, styrene, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate
and acrylonitrile are suitably used.</p> <p num="0017">The graft polymerization reaction in the present invention
can be conducted in any of the conditions of a latex, a natural rubber
solution or solid rubber. Of these, in view of cost and ease in handling,
polymerization is preferably conducted in a latex. When polymerizing
in a latex, the natural rubber latex used is not particularly limited and
either of commercially available ammonia treated latex or field latex may
be used. When polymerizing in a solution, the organic solvent used is
not limited as long as the solvent itself does not react with the natural
rubber. For example, aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene,
chlorobenzene, toluene and xylene, aliphatic hydrocarbon such as n-heptane,
n-hexane, n-pentane and n-octane and alicyclic hydrocarbon
such as cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, tetralin and decalin can
suitably be used. Also, methylene chloride and tetrahydrofurane can
be used. When polymerizing in solid rubber, the rubber can be
modified by directly kneading with a roll or extrusion kneader.</p> <p num="0018">The polymerization initiator used in graft-copolymerization is
not particularly limited as long as it is a polymerization initiator usually
used in radical polymerization. Examples are peroxides such as
hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide,
di-tert-butylperoxide, dicumyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, acetyl
peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile, potassium
persulfate and ammonium persulfate. Of these, cumene hydroperoxide, 
tert-butyl hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile
and ammonium persulfate are suitably used.</p><p num="0019">When the polymerization initiator is used in a latex or a
solution, the polymerization temperature is 40 to 120°C, preferably 40 to
80°C. When the temperature is too low, the graft-copolymerization
reaction progresses slowly and when the temperature is too high, the
polymer gelates, thus being unfavorable.</p><p num="0020">Also, in the graft-copolymerization reaction, a redox-type
initiator can be used. When a redox-type initiator is used, the reaction
temperature can be lowered and as a result, gelation of the polymer can
be prevented. When a redox-type initiator is used, the polymerization
temperature is -10 to 40°C, preferably 20 to 40°C.</p><p num="0021">In a water-soluble redox, examples of an oxidant are
peroxides such as persulfate, hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxide and
as a water-soluble inorganic reducing agent, Fe<sup>2+</sup> salt or sodium bisulfite
(NaHSO<sub>3</sub>) and as an organic reducing agent, alcohol or polyamine can be
combined. In a nonaqueous redox, hydroperoxide, dialkyl peroxide or
diallyl peroxide is used as the oxidant and tertiary amine, naphthenic
acid salt, mercaptan or an organic metal compound [such as Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,
B(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, Zn(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] is used as the reducing agent. Examples of
combinations are hydrogen peroxide and Fe<sup>2+</sup> salt, persulfate and
sodium sulfite, cumene hydroperoxide and Fe<sup>2+</sup> salt, benzoyl peroxide
and dimethyl aniline, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and tetraethylene
pentamine and potassium persulfate and sodium sulfite.</p><p num="0022">The reaction time of graft-copolymerization in a latex or a
solution is preferably 2 to 10 hours.</p><p num="0023">When graft-copolymerizing an organic compound having an 
unsaturated bond in a latex, the organic compound can be added to a
latex in which an emulsifier is already added or the organic compound
can be emulsified and then added to the latex. Examples of the
emulsifier are not particularly limited and anionic surfactants such as
metal salt or ammonium salt of fatty acid, alkyl benzene sulfonic acid or
alkyl sulfate and amphoteric surfactants such as alkylamine salt and
quaternary ammonium salt can suitably be used.</p><p num="0024">The amount of the organic compound having an unsaturated
bond is 5 to 100 % by weight, preferably 5 to 80 % by weight, more
preferably 5 to 60 % by weight, most preferably 5 to 40 % by weight of
the amount of natural rubber (as solid content). When the amount of
the organic compound is more than 100 % by weight, development of
homopolymers increases and graft efficiency decreases, thus being
unfavorable. Also, when the amount of the organic compound is less
than 5 % by weight, the graft amount becomes small and the effects of
modifying become small, thus being unfavorable.</p><p num="0025">When the modified natural rubber is natural rubber graft-copolymerized
with an organic compound having an unsaturated bond,
the graft ratio thereof is preferably 5 to 50 % by weight. When the graft
ratio is less than 5 % by weight, the effects of modifying tend not be
obtained and when the graft ratio is more than 50 % by weight, abrasion
resistance tends to decrease. Herein, graft ratio is calculated by finding,
from NMR measurement data, area strength A of methine protons
derived from natural rubber near 5.10 ppm and area strength B of
protons derived from styrene phenyl groups near 7 ppm and then finding
the styrene content (area strength B/(area strength A + area strength B)).
Thereafter, using the obtained styrene content, the graft ratio is 
calculated from the following equation.
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">Graft ratio (%) =<st32:break type="required"/><st32:frac align="centre">Styrene Content × Total Polymer Weight after Polymerization (g) <st32:over>Weight of Rubber Added (g)</st32:over></st32:frac>× 100</st32:df></p><p num="0026">When the modified natural rubber is epoxidized natural
rubber, epoxidization is conducted using organic peracid. Examples of
the organic peracid are perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, performic acid,
perphthalic acid, perpropionic acid, trifluoro peracetic acid and
perbutyric acid. These organic peracids maybe added directly to the
latex or the two components which form organic peracid may be added
to the latex to produce organic peracid in the latex. When producing
organic peracid in the latex, for example, glacial acetic acid and
hydrogen peroxide are sequentially added to produce peracetic acid.</p><p num="0027">The amount of the organic peracid is 5 to 100 % by weight,
preferably 10 to 80 % by weight of the amount of natural rubber (as solid
content). When the amount of the organic peracid is more than 100 %
by weight, properties decrease by side reactions and when the amount is
less than 5 % by weight, the effects of modifying are not obtained, thus
being unfavorable.</p><p num="0028">As the reaction conditions for the epoxidizing reaction,
reaction is preferably conducted at 25 to 60°C for 2 to 24 hours.</p><p num="0029">When the modified natural rubber is epoxidized natural
rubber, the epoxidization degree is preferably 5 to 85 %. When the
epoxidization degree is less than 5 % by weight, the effects of epoxidizing
may not sufficiently be obtained and when the epoxidization degree is 
more than 85 %, processability and fuel efficiency tend to decrease.
Herein, the epoxidization degree (%) is calculated by finding, from NMR
measurement data, area strength A of methine protons derived from
natural rubber near 5.10 ppm and area strength C of protons derived
from epoxy groups near 2.7 ppm and then finding the epoxidization
degree (%) from the following equation.
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">Epoxidization degree (%) =<st32:break type="required"/><st32:frac align="centre">Area Strength C <st32:over>Area Strength A + Area Strength C</st32:over></st32:frac>× 100</st32:df></p><p num="0030">Examples of the modified natural rubber used in the present
invention are natural rubber graft-copolymerized with an organic
compound having an unsaturated bond and/or epoxidized natural
rubber. Of these, the modified natural rubber used in the present
invention is preferably graft-copolymerized natural rubber, from the
viewpoint of achieving both fuel efficiency and wet grip properties.</p><p num="0031">In the usual natural rubber latex, approximately 5 to 10 % by
weight of non-rubber components such as protein are present. These
non-rubber components, particularly protein, inhibit the modification of
natural rubber and for example, in the case of a graft-copolymer,
problems occur such as the graft ratio and graft efficiency decrease and
high effects of modifying cannot be obtained.</p><p num="0032">As the modified natural rubber of the present invention,
natural rubber, wherein the protein in the natural rubber is reduced to
at most 0.10 % by weight converted to nitrogen content, is preferably
used. By modifying using natural rubber deproteinized to a nitrogen 
content of at most 0.10 % by weight (hereinafter, may be referred to as
deproteinized natural rubber), natural rubber can be efficiently modified
and high effects of modifying can be obtained. In modified natural
rubber, the amount of protein is preferably at most 0.05 % by weight,
more preferably at least 0.03 % by weight converted to nitrogen content.
Natural rubber wherein the nitrogen content is reduced to at most
0.03 % by weight is considered to be almost completely free of protein.</p><p num="0033">Deproteinized natural rubber can be prepared by the method
of decomposing protein by adding a protein-decomposing enzyme or
bacteria to the latex and/or the method of repeatedly washing with a
surfactant such as soap.</p><p num="0034">The protein-decomposing enzyme is not particularly limited
and can be an enzyme derived from bacteria, filamentous bacteria or
yeast. Of these, protease derived from bacteria is preferably used.</p><p num="0035">As the surfactant, an anionic surfactant and/or a nonionic
surfactant can be used. Examples of the anionic surfactant are
carboxylic acid types, sulfonic acid types, sulfuric ester types and
phosphoric ester types. As the nonionic surfactant, polyoxyalkylene
ether types, polyoxyalkylene ester types, polyol fatty acid ester types,
sugar fatty acid ester types and alkyl polyglycoxide can be suitably be
used.</p><p num="0036">In order to decompose protein within the natural rubber latex
with the protein-decomposing enzyme, the protein-decomposing enzyme
is preferably added in a proportion of approximately 0.001 to 10 % by
weight of the amount of the field latex or ammonia treated latex (as solid
content). The time of treatment by the enzyme is not particularly
limited but treatment is preferably conducted for approximately a few 
minutes to one week. Also, the latex can be stirred or left still. Also,
the temperature may be adjusted if necessary and the suitable
temperature is 5 to 90°C, preferably 20 to 60°C. When the treatment
temperature is higher than 90°C, the enzyme is quickly deactivated and
when the temperature is lower than 5°C, the enzyme reaction has
difficulty progressing.</p><p num="0037">The method for washing the latex particles with a surfactant
can be either the method of washing latex, which is not enzyme-treated,
or the method of washing enzyme-treated latex.</p><p num="0038">The surfactant is preferably added within the range of 0.001
to 15 % by weight, particularly 0.001 to 10 % by weight, of the amount of
the latex (as solid content). As the washing method, there are the
method of adding the surfactant to latex, which is not enzyme-treated, or
enzyme-treated latex and then centrifuging and the method of
separating by coagulating the latex particles. In the case of washing
latex by centrifuging, centrifugation can be conducted once or several
times. Also, when washing natural rubber, synthetic rubber or
synthetic latex can be used in combination.</p><p num="0039">The rubber composition for a tire tread of the present
invention contains at least 5 % by weight, preferably at least 10 % by
weight, of modified natural rubber in the rubber component. When the
modified natural rubber in the rubber component is less than 5 % by
weight, the effects of adding modified natural rubber are small, thus
being unfavorable. Because the rubber composition for a tire tread of
the present invention contains at least 5 % by weight of modified natural
rubber in the rubber component, when used in a tire tread, a pneumatic
tire, which is excellent in fuel efficiency and wet grip performance, can 
be obtained without losing properties such as processability and
mechanical strength.</p><p num="0040">As the rubber component other than modified natural rubber
used in the present invention, a rubber component comprising natural
rubber and/or diene synthetic rubber is used. Examples of the diene
synthetic rubber used in the present invention are styrene-butadiene
rubber (SBR), butadiene rubber (BR), isoprene rubber (IR), ethylene-propylene-diene
rubber (EPDM), chloroprene rubber (CR), acrylonitrile-butadiene
rubber (NBR) and butyl rubber (IIR). These rubbers may be
used alone or two or more kinds may be combined.</p><p num="0041">The rubber composition of the present invention contains
carbon black and/or silica.</p><p num="0042">The carbon black used in the present invention preferably
has a nitrogen-absorbing specific surface area (N<sub>2</sub>SA) of 70 to 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g,
more preferably 90 to 250 m<sup>2</sup>/g. When the N<sub>2</sub>SA of carbon black is less
than 70 m<sup>2</sup>/g, obtaining sufficient reinforcing properties and abrasion
resistance is difficult and when the N<sub>2</sub>SA is more than 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g,
dispersability decreases and heat generating properties increase, thus
being unfavorable. Examples of the carbon black are HAF, ISAF and
SAF, but are not particularly limited.</p><p num="0043">The amount of carbon black contained in the rubber
composition of the present invention is 5 to 150 parts by weight,
preferably 10 to 120 parts by weight, more preferably 15 to 100 part by
weight based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber component. When
the amount of carbon black is less than 5 parts by weight, reinforcing
properties and abrasion resistance decrease and when the amount is
more than 150 parts by weight, not only does dispersability decrease but 
also the desired properties cannot be obtained, thus being unfavorable.</p><p num="0044">Usually, an example of silica is silica prepared by wet method
or dry method but silica used in the present invention is not particularly
limited.</p><p num="0045">The silica has a nitrogen-absorbing specific surface area
(N<sub>2</sub>SA) of 100 to 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g, preferably 130 to 280 m<sup>2</sup>/g. When the N<sub>2</sub>SA
of silica is less than 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g, the reinforcing effects are small and when
the N<sub>2</sub>SA of silica is more than 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g, dispersability decreases and
heat generating properties of the rubber composition increase, thus
being unfavorable.</p><p num="0046">The amount of silica is 5 to 150 parts by weight, preferably 10
to 120 parts by weight, more preferably 15 to 100 parts by weight based
on 100 parts by weight of the rubber component. When the amount of
silica is less than 5 parts by weight, low heating generating properties
and wet grip performance cannot sufficiently be obtained and when the
amount is more than 150 parts by weight, processability and workability
decrease, thus being unfavorable.</p><p num="0047">To the rubber composition for a tire tread of the present
invention, compounding agents usually used in the rubber industry
other than modified natural rubber, rubber component, carbon black
and silica, such as a filler, softening agent, antioxidant, vulcanizing
agent, vulcanization accelerator and vulcanization accelerating aid can
be compounded accordingly if necessary.</p><p num="0048">In the case that silica is added, a silane coupling agent is
preferably added. The type of silane coupling agent is not particularly
limited but a silane coupling agent represented by the following formula
(1) can suitably be used. <st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">(C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>-Si-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>-S<sub>1</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>-Si-(C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>O)<sub>3</sub></st32:che></p><p num="0049">In formula (1), n is an integer of 1 to 3, m is an integer of 1 to
4 and 1 is an integer of 2 to 8.</p><p num="0050">In formula (1), 1 represents the number of sulfur atoms in the
polysulfide part and in the silane coupling agent, the average value of 1 is
preferably 2.1 to 3.5. When the average value of 1 is less than 2.1,
reactivity of the silane coupling agent and the rubber component tends
to become poor and when the average value is more than 3.5, gelation
may progress during processing.</p><p num="0051">Examples of the silane coupling agent are bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)polysulfide,
bis(2-triethoxysilylethyl)polysulfide,
bis(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)polysulfide, bis(2-trimethoxysilylethyl)polysulfide,
bis(4-triethoxysilylbutyl)polysulfide
and bis(4-trimethoxysilylbutyl)polysulfide. Of these silane coupling
agents, bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)polysulfide is suitably used from the
viewpoint of achieving both the effects of adding the coupling agent and
low cost. These silane coupling agents may be used alone or in a
combination of two or more kinds.</p><p num="0052">The amount of the silane coupling agent is preferably 1 to
20 % by weight of the weight of silica. When the amount of the silane
coupling agent is less than 1 % by weight, the effects of adding a silane
coupling agent cannot be sufficiently obtained and when the amount is
more than 20 % by weight, cost becomes high, the coupling effect cannot
be obtained and reinforcing properties and abrasion resistance decrease,
thus being unfavorable. In view of the dispersion effect and coupling
effect, the amount of the silane coupling agent is preferably 2 to 15 % by 
weight of the weight of silica.</p><p num="0053">The rubber composition for a tire tread of the present
invention is obtained by simultaneously kneading the rubber
component and compounding agents such as carbon black and/or silica
in the kneading step at a kneading temperature of 120 to 200°C. When
the kneading temperature is a temperature lower than 120°C, sufficient
properties cannot be obtained and when the temperature is higher than
200°C, the phenomenon of scorching occurs. More, preferably, the
kneading temperature is 140 to 180°C.</p><p num="0054">The kneading time in the kneading step is preferably 4 to 15
minutes. When the kneading time is less than 4 minutes, dispersion of
compounding agents such as carbon black and/or silica tends to be
insufficient. When the kneading time is more than 15 minutes, the
molecular weight of the rubber component becomes low and sufficient
properties cannot be obtained, thus being unfavorable.</p><p num="0055">The pneumatic tire of the present invention has a tread
comprising the rubber composition. The pneumatic tire can be
prepared by the usual method for preparing a pneumatic tire. That is,
the rubber composition is extrusion processed in the shape of a tire
tread in an unvulcanized state and then laminated by the usual method
on a tire forming machine to form an unvulcanized tire. The
unvulcanized tire obtained in this way is heated and pressurized in a
vulcanizer to obtain a pneumatic tire. The pneumatic tire obtained in
this way is excellent in abrasion resistance, fuel efficiency and wet grip
properties, as a result of containing modified natural rubber in the
tread.</p><p num="0056">Hereinafter, the present invention is explained in detail by 
means of Examples, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p num="0057">The various compounding agents used in Examples and

that Comparative Example 16 was assumed to be standard (100).</p><p num="0089">The results are shown in Table 7. <img id="img-00360001" orientation="unknown" wi="147" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00360001.tif" inline="no" he="218"/></p><p num="0090">According to the results of Tables 2 to 7, in Examples where a
polymer, which is a specific modified natural rubber, was used, rolling
resistance, abrasion resistance and wet grip performance were improved
without losing processability, in comparison to Comparative Examples
where the usual natural rubber was compounded.</p><p num="0091">Also, when natural rubber (HANR) having a high nitrogen
content was used in the rubber component, wet grip performance
decreased. When unmodified polymers were used in the rubber
component, abrasion resistance decreased.</p><p num="0092">According to the present invention, by using the rubber
composition for a tire tread described in Claims 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for a tire
tread, a pneumatic tire can be obtained, in which abrasion resistance
and wet grip performance are excellent and rolling resistance is reduced
without losing processability.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>A rubber composition for a tire tread comprising
