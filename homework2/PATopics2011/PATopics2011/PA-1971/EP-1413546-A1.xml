shift reaction (CO + H<sub>2</sub>O ↔ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>) towards the production of carbon dioxide and 
hydrogen by adsorbing carbon dioxide produced by the reaction. </p><p num="0002">A conventional practice for producing hydrogen product containing low levels of 
carbon oxides (carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide) is to purify raw syngas (from steam 
methane reformer, partial oxidation reactor, autothermal reformer, etc.) by cooling the 
gas to 600-950°F, reducing CO to ∼1-5% in a high temperature shift (HTS) reactor, 
cooling the gas to 350-600°F, further reducing CO to ∼0.2-0.4% in a low temperature 
shift (LTS) reactor, cooling the gas to 100°F, removing CO<sub>2</sub> in a liquid chemical or 
physical absorption system, and methanating carbon oxides. A more recently developed 
industrial practice comprises cooling the gas to 600-950°F, reducing CO to ∼1-5% in a 
high temperature shift (HTS) reactor, cooling the gas to 100°F, and removing CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, 
CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> in a H<sub>2</sub>PSA unit. </p><p num="0003">The shift reaction is carried out in shift reactors. These reactors are used to 
increase the amount of H<sub>2</sub> produced from the process and reduce the level of CO in the  
 
feed gas to the separation unit. The reactors are designed to permit very close approach 
to reaction equilibrium, so the CO conversion is limited by the shift reaction 
thermodynamics. Both the reaction temperature and the presence of byproduct carbon 
dioxide influence the reaction conversion. </p><p num="0004">Since the shift reaction (CO + H<sub>2</sub>O -&gt; CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>) is exothermic, the CO 
conversion is increased with lower temperature. High temperature systems, utilizing only 
HTS reactors, are limited to ∼75% CO conversion, and the rest of the CO (and H<sub>2</sub> that in 
principle could be produced via the shift reaction) is lost. The overall CO conversion can 
be increased to &gt;95% by utilizing a series of HTS and LTS reactors at the expense of 
additional process complexity (additional cooling and LTS equipment). </p><p num="0005">Since the shift reaction conversion in conventional reactors is not 100%, a 
significant amount of CO will be present in the shift reactor exit gas. The effluent gas 
from a typical LTS reactor contains roughly 0.3% CO (3,000 ppm), 19.5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 1.3% 
CH<sub>4</sub>, and 78.9% H<sub>2</sub> (dry basis). Effluent gas from the HTS reactor will contain even more 
CO (1-5%) and less CO<sub>2</sub>. The effluent gas must be further purified, typically in a 4- to 
12-bed H<sub>2</sub>PSA unit, to reduce the CO and CO<sub>2</sub> levels to &lt;0.01%. In PEM fuel cell 
applications, the CO level must be reduced even further (limits typically around 10 ppm). </p><p num="0006">The presence of CO<sub>2</sub> in the HTS and LTS reactors limits the CO conversion that 
can be achieved. If CO<sub>2</sub> could be removed from the feed gas to the shift reactors, the 
CO conversion would be increased. This is not practiced, though, since the gas would 
require cooling for CO<sub>2</sub> removal, followed by reheating for shifting, and the added 
complexity is not worthwhile. Ideally, one would prefer to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the shift 
reactor feed gas, and also remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the reaction gas as it progresses through 
the shift reactor. If CO<sub>2</sub> can be removed completely as it is formed, then the CO 
conversion in principle could reach 100%, and the CO would be reacted to extinction. </p><p num="0007">Accordingly, there have been a number of efforts to shift the water gas shift 
reaction towards production of carbon dioxide and hydrogen (i.e., towards completion) by  
 
adsorbing carbon dioxide produced by the reaction. A number of these efforts have 
comprised adsorbing CO<sub>2</sub> on chemical adsorbents such as calcium oxide or dolomite. 
Regeneration of these materials is possible only by heating the solid to 750°C or higher, 
so generally these processes are classified as temperature swing adsorption systems. </p><p num="0008">For example, U.S. Patent No. 1,816,523 to Gluud et al. proposed the use of 
lime or dolomite to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the shift reaction, and regenerated the carbonate 
by burning fuel in the vessel to increase the temperature to 900-1000°C. </p><p num="0009">Han et al., "Simultaneous Shift Reaction and Carbon Dioxide Separation for the 
Direct Production of Hydrogen", Chem. Eng. Sci., 49, 5875 (1994), and "Multicycle 
Performance of a Single-Step Process for H2 Production", Sep. Sci. Tech., 32, 681 
(1997) have also worked with the same chemisorbent, and found that the CO<sub>2</sub> capacity 
and carbonation rate of the dolomite decreased as it was cycled over a number of 
reaction/regeneration steps. In their 1994 publication, Han et al. found that the major 
economic obstacle for producing H<sub>2</sub> from coal using this approach was due to the 
substantial regeneration energy requirement. </p><p num="0010">Others have tried to use dolomite or calcium oxide chemisorbents in a reformer 
to enhance the steam methane reforming reaction. This approach is again based on the 
fact that removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the reactor shifts the water gas shift reaction, which in turn 
will shift the reforming reaction to higher conversion. </p><p num="0011">For example, Brun-Tsekhovoi et al., "The Process of Catalystic Steam-Reforming 
of Hydrocarbons in the Presence of Carbon Dioxide Acceptor", Proc. 7th 
World Hydrogen Energy Conf., 2, 885 (1988) and Kurdyumov et al. "Steam Conversion 
of Methane in the Presence of a Carbon Dioxide Acceptor, Pet. Chem., 36, 2, 139 (1996) 
describe fluidized bed processes, wherein Ni reforming catalyst and dolomite are 
fluidized with steam and natural gas. The authors observed increased methane 
conversion, relatively high H<sub>2</sub> purity (94-98%), and low carbon oxide levels. They 
mention that the process may be capable of eliminating the need for CO-shift, CO<sub>2</sub> 
 
removal, and methanation steps, and could reduce the required operating temperature of 
the reformer. The articles teach the use of catalyst and dolomite of different sizes to 
allow separation of spent dolomite, which is subsequently regenerated at high 
temperature in an external furnace. </p><p num="0012">WO 96/33794 (Lyon) discloses a somewhat similar approach, using a fixed bed, 
CaO and Ni catalyst. The reaction of steam and hydrocarbon is carried out at 600-800°C, 
and the CO<sub>2</sub> formed reacts to form CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Passing air through the bed 
regenerates it. The O<sub>2</sub> in the air exothermically reacts with Ni to form NiO, and the 
energy from this reaction is used to decompose CaCO<sub>3</sub> to CaO and regenerate the 
chemisorbent. </p><p num="0013">Researchers at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. have obtained patents on a 
Sorption Enhanced Reaction process, wherein a high temperature CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbent is 
used to remove CO<sub>2</sub> and shift the steam methane reforming reactions to higher 
conversions. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,303,092 to Anand et al. and U.S. Patent No. 
6,315,973 to Nataraj et al. and the related publications, Carvill et al., "Sorption Enhanced 
Reaction Process", AlChE J., 42, 2765 (1996), Hufton et al., "Sorption Enhanced 
Reaction Process for Hydrogen Production", AlChE J., 45, 248 (1999) and Waldron et 
al., "Production of Hydrogen by Cyclic Sorption Enhanced Reaction ", AlChE J., 47, 1477 
(2001). These researchers have described a process used to shift the reverse water gas 
shift reaction to enhance CO production by adsorbing water on a high temperature water 
adsorbent. A specific process cycle is described which utilizes pressure swing 
adsorption concepts for regeneration of the adsorbent. The use of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbents for 
shifting the reforming reaction is also described. </p><p num="0014">Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. researchers have also patented high 
temperature CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbents particularly suitable for use in the aforementioned 
processes. See U.S. Patent No. 6,280,503 to Mayorga et al.  </p><p num="0015">EP444987 to Ogawa et al. discloses the application of high temperature CO<sub>2</sub> 
adsorption processes for removing CO<sub>2</sub> from turbine feed gas. Ogawa et al. used a shift 
reactor with heat removal to shift CO to CO<sub>2</sub>, cooled the gas, and then passed it through 
a separate CO<sub>2</sub> PSA unit at 200-300C to remove CO<sub>2</sub>. The shift reactor effluent contains 
all of the carbon present in the reformer feedstock. The goal was to remove carbon from 
the fuel gas before it was fired in the gas turbine. Specific adsorbents or adsorption 
process cycles are not disclosed. </p><p num="0016">Despite the foregoing developments, it is desired to provide a system of 
enhanced efficiency for shifting the water gas shift reaction towards the production of 
carbon dioxide and hydrogen by adsorbing carbon dioxide produced by the reaction. </p><p num="0017">All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their

product containing low levels of carbon oxides (CO<sub>x</sub>). Preferred embodiments of the 
invention improve upon the prior art by providing 1) enhanced CO conversion beyond 
equilibrium limits, regardless of shift reactor temperature, 2) enhanced recovery of H<sub>2</sub> 
from the H<sub>2</sub> and CO in the reformer effluent gas stream than conventional processes, 
and 3) production of a relatively high purity H<sub>2</sub> product (e.g., 95+%) containing very little 
CO and CO<sub>2</sub>. (All percentages given herein are in dry volume percent unless otherwise 
indicated. Likewise, all concentrations given in ppm are in dry ppm unless otherwise  
 
indicated.) In addition, certain embodiments of the inventive apparatus replace the 
capital and energy intensive shift reactor/separation unit process train of conventional 
systems with a single process unit, which combines the reaction and separation 
functions. The invention is particularly useful for producing relatively pure H<sub>2</sub> for refinery 
operations, low CO hydrogen fuel for PEM fuel cells, and/or decarbonized hydrogen gas 
for low CO<sub>2</sub> emission power generation. </p><p num="0024">The process is conducted in conjunction with a Sorption Enhanced Reaction 
unit (sometimes referred to hereinafter as a sorption enhanced reactor or simply 
"reactor"), where the water gas shift reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable 
CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbent. It is preferred to conduct the inventive process in a series of cycles in 
more than one reactor, wherein one reactor is being regenerated while another reactor is 
being operated in parallel to produce the product gas. </p><p num="0025">Referring to Fig. 1, reactor 10 is a vessel having feed gas inlet 12 at the feed 
end of the vessel, product gas outlet 14 at the product end of the bed, first bed 16 
downstream of feed gas inlet 12, intermediate bed 18 downstream of first bed 16, second 
bed 20 downstream of intermediate bed 18, and insulated walls 22 surrounding the beds. 
While the contents of reactor 10 are described as three beds, the contents can also be 
described as a single, three-layered, bed. </p><p num="0026">In preferred embodiments, the first and second beds independently comprise at 
least one special high temperature CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbent, which does not require high 
temperature regeneration (e.g., regeneration at temperatures of at least 700°C). Thus, 
adsorbents such as CaO and dolomite are preferably excluded from the inventive 
process. Instead, preferred adsorbents of the invention have high CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption 
capacity at process temperatures greater than 200°C, even in the presence of steam. 
Suitable adsorbents include but are not limited to: (a) solid adsorbents containing metal 
oxides wherein the metal is at least one of sodium, magnesium, manganese and  
 
lanthanum; (b) K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> promoted hydrotalcites; (c) solid adsorbents containing modified 
double layered hydroxides represented by Formula I:

0.9, and x indicates an extent of hydration. </p><p num="0027">Intermediate bed 18 comprises a shift catalyst for catalyzing the water shift 
reaction. Suitable shift catalysts include but are not limited to: (a) high temperature shift 
catalyst (HTS), composed of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (e.g., catalyst 71-5, available from Synetix, 
Billingham, UK) and active in the temperature range 350-550°C; (b) low temperature shift 
(LTS) catalysts and medium temperature shift (MTS) catalysts, based on CuO/ZnO (e.g., 
catalysts 83-3, 83-6, available from Synetix, Billingham, UK), and active in the 
temperature range 175-350°C; and (c) shift catalysts based on noble metals as 
described in the literature. </p><p num="0028">In the preferred embodiment of Fig. 1, second bed 20 contains the shift catalyst 
in addition to adsorbent (which can be identical to or different from the adsorbent in the 
first bed). The shift catalyst and adsorbent can be provided in the second bed in equal or 
unequal amounts. The mixture in the second bed can consist of a physical admixture of 
adsorbent and catalyst particles. It can also consist of particles that individually comprise 
both the adsorbent and the shift catalyst. For example, the adsorbent may be processed  
 
to include active metals with sufficient catalytic activity for the water gas shift reaction. 
For a physical admixture, the relative concentrations of the shift catalyst and adsorbent 
can be a function of location in the second bed, such that a shift catalyst (or adsorbent) 
concentration gradient is provided. The volume ratio of adsorbent to catalyst in the 
second bed is preferably 0.25 to 10, more preferably 3 to 10. When a gradient is 
provided in the second bed, the percentage (volume) of adsorbent preferably increases 
from feed end to product end of the second bed, preferably from 0 to 100%, more 
preferably from 30 to 100%. </p><p num="0029">It is also possible to utilize a single bed reactor packed with a mixture of 
adsorbent and shift catalyst (as a mixture of separate adsorbent and catalyst particles or 
as a collection of particles each comprising the adsorbent and the shift catalyst). This 
approach simplifies reactor packing, but will yield lower volumetric productivity (moles of 
H<sub>2</sub> produced per volume of reactor). </p><p num="0030">Reactor 10 is preferably an adiabatic vessel, as indicated by insulated walls 22 
in Fig. 1. Suitable insulation includes but is not limited to glass fiber, calcium silicate, and 
mineral wool. The temperature achieved in the reactor depends on the syngas feed 
temperature and composition. For an example case of syngas generated by steam 
methane reforming, complete reaction of CO contained in the syngas in a steady state, 
adiabatic catalyst-only shift reactor would yield an increase in product temperature of 
65.6°C compared to the syngas feed temperature. In the case of an SER reactor, the 
temperature will swing from a maximum at the end of the reaction step to a minimum at 
the end of the regeneration step. The maximum temperature increase would likely be 
larger than 65.6°C, since the heat of adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> would contribute to the heat 
generation term. If the maximum temperature is higher than the acceptable operating 
temperature for the shift catalyst or CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbent, then provisions (e.g., active thermal 
control means in addition to or in lieu of passive insulation) must be included for 
removing heat from the reactor. Such provisions can include a shell and tube reactor,  
 
where the catalyst and adsorbent are placed in the tubes, and a heat transfer medium is 
passed through the shell. For adsorption temperatures of up to 320°C, the shell side 
fluid is preferably water, and steam is generated. The reactor can then replace all shift 
reactors and the HTS boiler of a conventional H<sub>2</sub> plant. The shells would be in fluid 
communication with the plant steam drum via down comers and risers. </p><p num="0031">For adsorption temperatures above 316°C, a separate heat transfer fluid (such 
as Dowtherm A) can be used. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,315,973 at Fig. 7 and the 
corresponding text therein. These fluids are generally limited to about 425°C, and at 
higher temperatures, heat transfer to hot air or process gas would be appropriate. </p><p num="0032">Although the process is preferably conducted in sorption enhanced reactor 
vessel(s), it is also within the scope of the invention to conduct the process in other 
containers or on other substrates. For example, it is possible to separate the three beds 
depicted in Fig. 1 into three interconnected vessels, rather than the single vessel shown 
in the figure. This would facilitate removal of catalyst from the intermediate bed, without 
disturbing the first and second beds. </p><p num="0033">The apparatus of Fig. 1 can be employed to produce H<sub>2</sub> substantially free of 
carbon-oxides without a H<sub>2</sub>PSA. This is accomplished by treating effluent gas 
(generically referred to as "syngas") from a syngas generator, such as a steam methane 
reformer (SMR), a partial oxidation reactor (POX), or an autothermal reformer (e.g., an 
air-blown or oxygen-blown ATR). This gas will generally comprise a mixture of H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, 
CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>. Preferably, the gas fed to the SER reactor comprises 25-75 
vol.% H<sub>2</sub>, 10-50 vol.% H<sub>2</sub>O, 1-20 vol.% CO, 1-20 vol.% CO<sub>2</sub>, 0-50% N2, and 
0.1-5 vol.% CH<sub>4</sub>. High levels of N<sub>2</sub> would be present if the syngas was generated via an 
air-blown ATR. The syngas from the syngas generator can be sent to the SER unit, or it 
may be first processed in a conventional HTS reactor to reduce the CO level in the SER 
feed gas. The final feed to the SER unit may need to be heat exchanged and/or have its 
moisture content adjusted prior to treatment in reactor 10. The syngas feed typically  
 
contains steam in excess of what is stoichiometrically required to convert all the CO in 
the syngas. If not, steam can be added before the syngas enters reactor 10. </p><p num="0034">Any unconverted methane, nitrogen, argon or other inerts are not converted or 
significantly reduced in the SER reactor. For non-air based syngas generators, the inert 
component at highest concentration is methane. Since methane leakage from a POX 
front-end is only about 0.4 mole% dry, the purity of the H<sub>2</sub> effluent from the shift-SER 
reactor in this case will be in excess of 98%. Likewise, as illustrated in the Examples 
below, methane leakage from SMR's can be reduced to &lt;2.5% dry with 900°C outlet 
temperatures (S/C 3.5, 2.07MPa). These conditions are typical of SMR's for syngas 
production. In both cases, CO and CO<sub>2</sub> levels will be very low (e.g., 0-1 vol.%) in the 
product gas from the SER unit. </p><p num="0035">The syngas feed in the reactor of Fig. 1 passes from the bottom of the bed to 
the top, but other orientations, such as top to bottom, are also possible. Reactor 10 is 
illustrated as an adiabatic (insulated) vessel packed with three layers of solid material. 
The desired reactor temperature will lie within the range of 175 to 550°C, depending on 
the type of catalyst and adsorbent used. Generally, the feed syngas is available at 175 
to 550°C and relatively high pressure dictated by the operation of the syngas generator 
(e.g., up to 3.5 MPa). During the SER reaction step, this gas is preferably fed into the 
SER reactor at a flow rate of 5 to 50 gmole/hr/cm<sup>2</sup>. The average reactor temperature 
during the process will be similar to the feed syngas temperature. Localized reaction 
temperatures will vary by 20-70°C during the process cycle since the reaction step is 
exothermic (both the shift reaction and the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption), and regeneration is 
endothermic (CO<sub>2</sub> desorption). </p><p num="0036">During the reaction step, the syngas first passes through first bed 16, which 
contains a layer of previously regenerated high temperature CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbent where CO<sub>2</sub> 
present in the syngas is removed. The length of this adsorbent-only layer is sufficient to  
 
remove all of the CO<sub>2</sub> entering reactor 10 during the reaction step. The process gas 
leaving first bed 16 contains a reduced amount of (and preferably an absence of) CO<sub>2</sub>. </p><p num="0037">The CO<sub>2</sub> depleted gas from first bed 16 passes to intermediate bed 18, which 
contains only shift catalyst. Some of the CO reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O to form CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> in 
intermediate bed 18. The length of this catalyst-only zone is sufficient to equilibrate the 
process gas. </p><p num="0038">The resulting process gas from intermediate bed 18 is next passed to second 
bed 20, which contains an intimate mixture of shift catalyst and high temperature CO<sub>2</sub> 
adsorbent. This mixture could be uniform throughout the length of the bed, or could be 
catalyst-rich or adsorbent-rich towards the product end of the reactor. As the process 
gas from intermediate bed 18 (sometimes referred to herein as "the product mixture") 
flows through the catalyst/adsorbent admixture, the gas progressively contacts fresh 
catalyst/adsorbent, CO<sub>2</sub> is progressively adsorbed to near extinction, and additional CO 
is forced to react with steam (CO + H<sub>2</sub>O ↔ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>). This forms additional CO<sub>2</sub>, which 
is also progressively removed, thereby reducing the CO level to near extinction. A 
concentration wave-front is established, which progresses along second bed 20 at a rate 
determined by the capacity of the bed to hold CO<sub>2</sub>. Downstream of this wave-front, gas 
essentially free of carbon-oxides flows to product gas outlet 14 where it is withdrawn as 
product. The steam in this product can be easily removed by condensation and thermal 
swing adsorption, if drier product is required. The length of second bed 20 is sufficient to 
contain the concentration wave and prevent significant breakthrough of CO<sub>2</sub> or CO. </p><p num="0039">Once the concentration wave approaches the end of second bed 20, the 
reaction step is terminated by stopping feed gas flow to reactor 10, and the reactor beds 
are regenerated. </p><p num="0040">Prior to regenerating the reactor beds, reactor 10 can optionally be 
countercurrently purged at feed gas pressure with purge gas. The effluent gas from this 
step will contain unreacted CO and H<sub>2</sub>O which can be recycled and combined with feed  
 
gas to another SER reactor. In this way, one can produce a CO<sub>2</sub> and CO depleted 
product stream with enhanced hydrogen recovery. Alternatively, reactor 10 can 
optionally be cocurrently rinsed at feed gas pressure with CO<sub>2</sub> product before 
regenerating, to recover a CO<sub>2</sub> and CO depleted product stream with enhanced 
hydrogen recovery and a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich byproduct stream (during the regeneration step). As 
used herein the term "cocurrent" refers to passing a substance through the reactor in the 
same direction as the feed gas, and the term "countercurrent" refers to passing a 
substance in the opposite direction of the feed gas (with respect to the direction of the 
feed gas during the reaction step). </p><p num="0041">To regenerate the reactor beds, reactor 10 is first depressurized countercurrent 
to the feed gas, and then purge gas (e.g., steam, a steam/H<sub>2</sub> mixture, or any other 
suitable gas free of CO<sub>2</sub>) is passed through the bed countercurrent to the feed. This 
purge helps to strip CO<sub>2</sub> off the adsorbent. The desorption of CO<sub>2</sub> from a loaded bed is 
endothermic. Ideally, the energy needed to desorb CO<sub>2</sub> can be obtained from the 
thermal energy content of the reactor packing, which is high at the beginning of the 
desorption step. Superheating the purge gas can provide additional heat. Alternatively, 
for the shell and tube configuration discussed above, with steam heat transfer medium, 
heat can provided by mixing steam into the saturated water flowing through the 
downcomer from the steam drum into the reactor shells. This keeps the shell under a 
constant flow and pressure. The shell has temporarily switched from being a boiler to 
being a barometric condenser. </p><p num="0042">The purge effluent is cooled to knock out the steam, and the condensate is 
reused. The non-condensate is a crude CO<sub>2</sub> stream that, optionally, can be fed to a 
liquefaction plant for production of byproduct CO<sub>2</sub>. </p><p num="0043">Once the purge step is completed, the reactor is pressurized to the syngas feed 
pressure with steam, a steam/H<sub>2</sub> mixture, syngas feed, or any combination of the three. 
Thus, in embodiments, the pressurization gas comprises at least one of the purge gas  
 
and the feed gas. Steam and steam/H<sub>2</sub> would be fed countercurrently, while syngas feed 
would be fed cocurrently. Once pressurized, the reactor is ready to repeat the process 
cycle and receive syngas feed. </p><p num="0044">The above process steps are preferably conducted with two or more reactors 
operated in parallel so that a constant feed and product stream can be obtained. </p><p num="0045">In certain embodiments, any remaining carbon oxides in the product gas can be 
converted to methane in a methanator to yield a product gas containing less than 
50 ppm CO, and more preferably less than 1 ppm CO. A schematic of this approach is 
illustrated in Fig 2. A hydrocarbon feedstock (e.g., natural gas, naphtha) and air, oxygen 
and/or steam are fed to syngas generator 24 to produce syngas, which is then fed to 
heat exchanger (e.g., waste heat boiler) 26, where steam is generated and the 
temperature of the syngas is reduced. The syngas is then fed to SER reactor 10 to 
produce the product gas, which is fed to methanator 28. The exit temperature of the 
product gas from reactor 10 is in the appropriate range for methanator operation (e.g., 
300 to 550°C). Water knock-out is not required. At these conditions, equilibrium 
methanation calculations for a steam methane reforming example case indicate that the 
shift-SER product gas containing 471 ppm CO and 0.33% CO<sub>2</sub> (dry basis) yields a CO 
content of only 0.6 ppb in the methanator effluent. Normal methanator operation occurs 
commercially in the absence of water. But prereformer catalyst can substitute in this 
service, and has been demonstrated in the presence of steam. This approach can yield 
H<sub>2</sub> product that can be used in refinery applications and in PEM fuel cells. The major 
attractiveness of this approach is that expensive H<sub>2</sub> purification or CO removal 
technology (H<sub>2</sub>-PSA or preferential oxidation reactor) is not required. </p><p num="0046">The CO<sub>2</sub> enriched purge gas from reactor 10 is preferably heat exchanged by 
heat exchanger 30 to generate steam. Likewise, the H<sub>2</sub> enriched product gas from 
methanator 28 is preferably heat exchanged by heat exchanger 32 to generate steam. 
Blowdown gas from reactor 10 is recycled back to syngas generator 24 to be  
 
compressed and added as feed or, for SMR applications, used as fuel in the reformer 
burners. The shift-SER process combined with a methanator preferably produces 
product containing 95-99% H<sub>2</sub>, 1-4% CH<sub>4</sub>, and less than 1 ppm of CO with no pressure 
swing adsorption separation unit. This gas is attractive as feed for PEM fuel cell system 
since the CO level is low and the gas is hydrated. </p><p num="0047">For H<sub>2</sub> purities greater than 99%, a PSA is preferred to remove unreacted CH<sub>4</sub> 
from the syngas generator, as shown in the embodiment of Fig. 3, wherein product gas 
from reactor 10 is treated by methanator 28 to remove carbon oxides from the product 
gas and heat exchanged by heat exchanger 32 before entering PSA 34. A PSA used in 
the invention can be predominantly carbon-based if desired, and therefore relatively 
inexpensive. In a conventional H<sub>2</sub>-PSA, the carbon removes water, CO<sub>2</sub>, and most of the 
CH<sub>4</sub>, and constitutes 40-60% of the bed. The remainder of the bed is molecular sieve, 
which removes CO, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar and remaining methane. In the current embodiment, and 
depending on the N<sub>2</sub> content of the natural gas, greater than 99% purity can be achieved 
in a PSA filled predominantly with carbon; the molecular sieve layer is substantially 
reduced since only ppm levels of CO have to be removed. This would result in 
substantial savings in capital, and could increase the H<sub>2</sub>PSA recovery. </p><p num="0048">If a PSA is used, the PSA adsorber beds and SER reactors can be 
synergistically coupled to minimize unrecovered product. The PSA waste gas obtained 
as effluent during the purge step does not contain any component that would hurt the 
SER reactor (i.e., no carbon oxides). Thus, PSA waste gas can augment the SER 
reactor purge flow. More interestingly, the PSA beds can pressure equalize with an SER 
reactor at lower pressure. These steps ensure that product lost from either process is 
not additive in nature. The minimum number of PSA or SER reactors required is also 
reduced. Normally, for an isolated pressure swing process, the minimum number of 
vessels must exceed the number of pressure equalizations by two. Coupling of the SER 
reactors with the H<sub>2</sub>-PSA vessels can ease this requirement.  </p><p num="0049">Unlike a conventional H<sub>2</sub>PSA, pure H<sub>2</sub> is preferably not used to purge or 
repressurize the SER reactor - steam is the main candidate. Purge efficacy is 
determined on an actual cubic feet (ACF) basis. For the same ACF at the same purge 
pressure, steam has only 1/18 the heating value of methane. Since steam and methane 
are substantially valued proportional to their heating value, and hydrogen is valued at a 
much higher premium relative to its heating value than steam, steam is the cheapest 
purge gas available (other than air, which cannot be used due to O<sub>2</sub> content). The use 
of steam also simplifies CO<sub>2</sub> recovery from the shift-SER reactor purge effluent gas since 
it can be simply condensed and separated as liquid water. </p><p num="0050">Most shift catalysts used in the SER reactor function only in a reduced state. 
Steam can potentially oxidize the active metal phase of the catalyst. Thus (depending on 
the catalyst oxidation kinetics and purge cycle time) it may be desirable to have some H<sub>2</sub> 
present in the purge steam. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that very small 
amounts of H<sub>2</sub> (e.g., 0.001% or less) are capable of maintaining reducing conditions for 
both the Fe- and Cu-based catalysts. For embodiments of the invention with no H<sub>2</sub>-PSA, 
this H<sub>2</sub> would come from the product stream. For embodiments that include a H<sub>2</sub>-PSA for 
final cleanup, the H<sub>2</sub>PSA purge effluent (waste gas) can be used as the hydrogen 
source. </p><p num="0051">Inert gases can also be considered for purging the shift-SER reactor. Nitrogen 
might be attractive if the syngas generator is oxygen-based, since a significant amount of 
coproduct N<sub>2</sub> may be available from the air separation plant. Natural gas can be used as 
purge, and the effluent waste gas can be used for fuel. Other inert gases can be 
considered, but would have to be passed in a recycle loop where CO<sub>2</sub> is removed and 
discharged to minimize inert gas requirement. This would not be as attractive as the 
above options. Finally, a portion of the shift-SER product could be used as purge fluid, 
but this would substantially decrease the recovery of H<sub>2</sub> from the shift-SER reactor.  </p><p num="0052">In the case of fuel cell applications, the spent fuel gas exiting the fuel cell can be 
used to purge the SER reactor since this gas is free of carbon oxides. </p><p num="0053">The process cycle can be tailored for achieving higher H<sub>2</sub> recovery, and for 
production of byproduct CO<sub>2</sub> at high purity and recovery. </p><p num="0054">Higher feed gas recovery can be achieved by countercurrently rinsing the SER 
reactor with purge fluid at reaction step pressure. This step would be carried out after 
the reaction step has completed, but before the SER reactor is regenerated. The high 
pressure purge step would proceed until the purge gas begins to break through the feed 
end of the reactor. This will allow recovery of some of the void gas, which will contain 
H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>. If the purge gas is available at a substantially higher 
pressure than the reaction step pressure, then the recovered gas can be removed at the 
higher pressure, stored in a separate tank, and slowly added to the feed gas for another 
SER reactor. If the purge gas pressure is not sufficient, the recovered gas will need 
slight compression before it is added to the feed gas. The standard blowdown and purge 
steps would take place once the above recovery step has completed. </p><p num="0055">The effective recovery of hydrogen with the SER system can exceed the 
effective recovery in conventional shift/H<sub>2</sub>-PSA systems, and in fact can approach 100% 
if high-pressure purge steps are included in the cycle. </p><p num="0056">Relatively pure CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., 98+%) can be produced by including a CO<sub>2</sub> rinse step 
between the reaction and regeneration steps. By passing CO<sub>2</sub> product (e.g., 98+% CO<sub>2</sub>) 
cocurrently or countercurrently through the bed at reaction pressure, essentially all of the 
void gas can be removed. Depressurization and purge with steam will recover the high 
purity CO<sub>2</sub> present in the void gas and CO<sub>2</sub> desorbed from the adsorbent. Since CO<sub>2</sub> 
adsorption on the high temperature adsorbents is highly selective to CO<sub>2</sub>, a high purity 
CO<sub>2</sub> product will be recovered. Separation of the steam from CO<sub>2</sub> can be accomplished 
by cooling and, if required, thermal swing adsorption. The CO<sub>2</sub> will be recovered at the 
regeneration pressure when the regeneration step is carried out above 14.7 psia (101  
 
kPa). For subatmospheric regeneration, the CO<sub>2</sub> will be recovered at the discharge 
pressure of the vacuum system (typically around 101 kPa). </p><p num="0057">This process option is highly attractive for decarbonization of fuel gas to power 
generation systems (e.g., gas turbine). The only carbon in the H<sub>2</sub> product is in the form 
of CH<sub>4</sub>, which slips through the syngas generator. This is a relatively small amount of 
carbon. Table 1, below, shows that up to 94% of the carbon in the methane feed to the 
steam reformer can be removed as CO<sub>2</sub> in the shift-SER unit. Advantages of the 
approach are that carbon removal is carried out at high temperature (so steam is 
retained in the feed to the turbine, and cooling/liquid separation/heating equipment is not 
needed) and high pressure (separation at turbine feed conditions rather than turbine 
exhaust conditions). Retention of the steam and high temperature in the hydrogen fuel 
gas yields higher overall energy efficiency. </p><p num="0058">Other process steps that are found in the conventional pressure swing 
adsorption literature could also be carried out (e.g., pressure equalization steps between 
SER reactors, low pressure product rinse step when non-steam purge gases are used, 
etc.). </p><p num="0059">The invention will be illustrated in more detail with reference to the following 
Examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is not deemed to be 
limited thereto. </p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p num="0060">What follows are prospective examples of the process of the invention based on 
mass balance calculations. </p><p num="0061">Heat effects were not considered in the examples - the reactor was assumed to 
operate isothermally to simplify the calculations. A reactor temperature of 375°C and 
pressure of 2.07 MPa were assumed. </p><p num="0062">An apparatus including two SER reactors of Fig. 1 is provided. The composition 
of the syngas feed, considering equilibrium conversion of steam and methane in a  
 
reformer at a 3.5 molar steam/methane ratio, 900°C exit temperature, and 2.07 MPa, is 
49.53% H<sub>2</sub>, 34.80% H<sub>2</sub>O, 9.36% CO, 5.36% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 1.44% CH<sub>4</sub>. Nitrogen, a common 
low level impurity in natural gas, was ignored in the example case. In practice the N<sub>2</sub> will 
follow the CH<sub>4</sub> in the SER process. The syngas is cooled to 375°C and fed to the SER 
unit. Each SER reactor 10 is operated at 375°C and is subjected to a series of cyclic 
process steps consisting of reaction and regeneration steps. During the reaction step, 
bulk CO<sub>2</sub> in the feed gas is removed by adsorption, the shift reaction is catalyzed to form 
CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> from CO and steam, and the CO<sub>2</sub> is continually removed from the reaction 
product gas by adsorption onto the high temperature adsorbent. </p><p num="0063">The process gas leaving first bed 16 will contain 52.34% H<sub>2</sub>, 36.78% H<sub>2</sub>O, 
9.89% CO, and 0.99% CH<sub>4</sub>, assuming only CO<sub>2</sub> is removed by the adsorbent. Assuming 
that no components are removed by the catalyst, the product mixture from intermediate 
bed 18, calculated assuming reaction equilibrium at 375°C, will contain 61.05% H<sub>2</sub>, 
28.06% H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.18% CO, 8.71% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 0.99% CH<sub>4</sub>. </p><p num="0064">The removal of CO<sub>2</sub> in second bed 20 will drive the shift reaction to high 
conversion, regardless of operating temperature, and will yield product containing very 
low levels of carbon oxides. Assuming complete removal of CO<sub>2</sub> by second bed 20, the 
product gas from reactor 10 will contain 69.06% H<sub>2</sub>, 29.83% H<sub>2</sub>O, and 1.10% CH<sub>4</sub>, or 
98.4% H<sub>2</sub> and 1.57% CH<sub>4</sub> on a dry basis. In practice, the reaction step would generally 
proceed until the CO<sub>2</sub> level reached a prescribed, but low, level. Assuming the gas to be 
at reaction equilibrium, one can calculate the level of CO that coexists with the CO<sub>2</sub> as 
CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the system. These gas compositions for the example conditions 
are listed in Table 1. The major point is that the CO level will be reduced to levels lower 
than CO<sub>2</sub> at equilibrium. For example, at 93.02% removal of the carbon introduced with 
the reformer feed gas, the dry gas composition is 471 ppm CO when the equilibrium CO<sub>2</sub> 
mole fraction (dry) is 0.33%.  </p><p num="0065">Following the reaction step, the feed gas flow is switched to another reactor 10 
so that a constant feed and product stream can be obtained. The first reactor is 
regenerated by depressurization and countercurrent purging, preferably with steam, 
which helps to strip CO<sub>2</sub> off the adsorbent. The purge effluent is cooled to remove water, 
and the non-condensate is a crude CO<sub>2</sub> byproduct stream. </p><p num="0066">In order to compare the shift-SER reactor performance with conventional shift 
reactor/H<sub>2</sub>-PSA approach, we have evaluated an effective recovery, R<sub>eff</sub>, defined as the 
lb-moles (or kg-moles) of H<sub>2</sub> obtained in the product divided by the lb-moles (or kg-moles) 
of CO and H<sub>2</sub> in the syngas feed gas. For a conventional HTS/H<sub>2</sub>-PSA system 
(assuming equilibrium conversion in the shift reactor at 375°C and a PSA H<sub>2</sub> recovery of 
85%), the R<sub>eff</sub> value is 0.825. For a conventional HTS/LTS/H<sub>2</sub>-PSA system (assuming 
equilibrium conversion in the LTS reactor at 250°C and a PSA H<sub>2</sub> recovery of 85%), the 
R<sub>eff</sub> value is 0.845. The value of R<sub>eff</sub> for the example shift-SER process conducted at 
375°C is 0.930 (and in other embodiments is at least 0.9), or 10-13% greater than the 
conventional approaches. (It was assumed that gas losses from the sorber/reactor were 
due to complete void gas removal during regeneration. Purge gas was assumed to be 
steam or N<sub>2</sub>; no product gas was used. Gas requirements for generating the purge gas 
(e.g., methane to generate steam) were not considered.) The elimination of the need for 
product purge and effective conversion of the CO in the shift-SER reactor yields 
improved recovery of valuable hydrogen product. </p><p num="0067">While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific 
examples thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and 
modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.  <tables><table><tgroup cols="7"><tbody><row><entry align="center" namest="1"/><entry nameend="7" align="center"
