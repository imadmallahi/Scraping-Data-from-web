the invention</p><p num="p0003">The invention relates to glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5) that catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (5- oxo-prolyl, pGlu*) under liberation of ammonia and the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamate residues into pyroglutamic acid under liberation of water.</p><p num="p0004">Background of the invention Glutaminyl cyclase (QC, EC 2.3.2.5) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of N- terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu<sup>*</sup>) liberating ammonia. A QC was first isolated by Messer from the latex of the tropical plant Carica papaya in 1963 (Messer, M. 1963 Nature 4874, 1299). 24 years later, a corresponding enzymatic activity was discovered in animal pituitary (Busby, W. H. J. et al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262, 8532-8536; Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J. 1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 84, 3628-3632). For the mammalian QC, the conversion of Gin into pGlu by QC could be shown for the precursors of TRH and GnRH (Busby, W. H. J. et al. 1987 J Biol Chem 262, 8532-8536; Fischer, W. H. and Spiess, J. 1987 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 84, 3628-3632). In addition, initial localization experiments of QC revealed a co- localization with its putative products of catalysis in bovine pituitary, further improving the suggested function in peptide hormone synthesis (Bockers, T. M. et al. 1995 J Neuroendocrinol 7, 445-453). In contrast, the physiological function of the plant QC is less clear. In the case of the enzyme from C. papaya, a role in the plant defense against pathogenic microorganisms was suggested (El Moussaoui, A. et al.2001 Cell Mol Life Sci 58, 556-570). Putative QCs from other plants were identified by sequence comparisons recently (Dahl, S. W. et al.2000 Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36). The physiological function of these enzymes, however, is still ambiguous. The QCs known from plants and animals show a strict specificity for L-Glutamine in the N-terminal position of the substrates and their kinetic behavior was found to obey the Michaelis-Menten equation (Pohl, T. et al. 1991 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 88, 10059-10063; Consalvo, A. P. et al. 1988 Anal Biochem 175, 131-138; Gololobov, M. Y. et al. 1996 Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler 377, 395-398). A comparison of the primary structures of the QCs from C. papaya and that of the highly conserved QC from mammals, however, did not reveal any sequence homology (Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36). Whereas the plant QCs appear to belong to a new enzyme family (Dahl, S. W. et al. 2000 Protein Expr Purif 20, 27-36), the mammalian QCs were found to have a pronounced sequence homology to bacterial aminopeptidases (Bateman, R. C. et al. 2001 Biochemistry 40, 11246-11250), leading to the conclusion that the QCs from plants and animals have different evolutionary origins.</p><p num="p0005">Recently, it was shown that recombinant human QC as well as QC-activity from brain extracts catalyze both, the N-terminal glutaminyl as well as glutamate cyclization. Most striking is the finding, that cyclase-catalyzed Glui-conversion is favored around pH 6.0 while Glni-conversion to pGlu-derivatives occurs with a pH-optimum of around 8.0. Since the formation of pGlu-Aβ-related peptides can be suppressed by inhibition of recombinant human QC and QC-activity from pig pituitary extracts, the enzyme QC is a target in drug development for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p><p num="p0006">EP 02 011 349.4 discloses polynucleotides encoding insect glutaminyl cyclase, as well as polypeptides encoded thereby. This application further provides host cells comprising expression vectors comprising polynucleotides of the invention. Isolated polypeptides and host cells comprising insect QC are useful in methods of screening for agents that reduce glutaminyl cyclase activity.

Recent work showed that multiple active products are generated from the gastrin precursor, and that there are multiple control points in gastrin biosynthesis.

products, the amidated gastrins, regulate epithelial cell proliferation, the differentiation of acid-producing parietal cells and histamine-secreting enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and the expression of genes associated with histamine synthesis and storage in ECL cells, as well as acutely stimulating acid secretion. Gastrin also stimulates the production of members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, which in turn inhibit parietal cell function but stimulate the growth of surface epithelial cells. Plasma gastrin concentrations are elevated in subjects with Helicobacter pylori, who are known to have increased risk of duodenal ulcer disease and gastric cancer (Dockray, G.J. 1999 J Physiol 15 315-324).</p><p num="p0332">The peptide hormone gastrin, released from antral G cells, is known to stimulate the synthesis and release of histamine from ECL cells in the oxyntic mucosa via CCK-2 receptors. The mobilized histamine induces acid secretion by binding to the H(2) receptors located on parietal cells. Recent studies suggest that gastrin, in both its fully amidated and less processed forms (progastrin and glycine-extended gastrin), is also a growth factor for the gastrointestinal tract. It has been established that the major trophic effect of amidated gastrin is for the oxyntic mucosa of stomach, where it causes increased proliferation of gastric stem cells and ECL cells, resulting in increased parietal and ECL cell mass. On the other hand, the major trophic target of the less processed gastrin (e.g. glycine-extended gastrin) appears to be the colonic mucosa (Koh, T.J. and Chen, D. 2000 Regul Pept 9337-44).</p><p num="p0333">Neurotensin (NT) is a neuropeptide implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia that specifically modulates neurotransmitter systems previously demonstrated to be misregulated in this disorder. Clinical studies in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NT concentrations have been measured revealed a subset of schizophrenic patients with decreased CSF NT concentrations that are restored by effective antipsychotic drug treatment. Considerable evidence also exists concordant with the involvement of NT systems in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. The behavioral and biochemical effects of centrally administered NT remarkably resemble those of systemically administered antipsychotic drugs, and antipsychotic drugs increase NT neurotransmission. This concatenation of findings led to the hypothesis that NT functions as an endogenous antipsychotic. Moreover, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs differentially alter NT neurotransmission in

B. et al. 2001 Biol Psychiatry 50 856-872).</p><p num="p0334">Fertilization promoting peptide (FPP), a tripeptide related to thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH), is found in seminal plasma. Recent evidence obtained in vitro and in vivo showed that FPP plays an important role in regulating sperm fertility. Specifically, FPP initially stimulates nonfertilizing (uncapacitated) spermatozoa to "switch on" and become fertile more quickly, but then arrests capacitation so that spermatozoa do not undergo spontaneous acrosome loss and therefore do not lose fertilizing potential. These responses are mimicked, and indeed augmented, by adenosine, known to regulate the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP signal transduction pathway. Both FPP and adenosine have been shown to stimulate cAMP production in uncapacitated cells but inhibit it in capacitated cells, with FPP receptors somehow interacting with adenosine receptors and G proteins to achieve regulation of AC. These events affect the tyrosine phosphorylation state of various proteins, some being important in the initial "switching on," others possibly being involved in the acrosome reaction itself. Calcitonin and angiotensin II, also found in seminal plasma, have similar effects in vitro on uncapacitated spermatozoa and can augment responses to FPP. These molecules have similar effects in vivo, affecting fertility by stimulating and then maintaining fertilizing potential. Either reductions in the availability of FPP, adenosine, calcitonin, and angiotensin II or defects in their receptors contribute to male infertility (Fraser, L.R. and Adeoya-Osiguwa, S. A. 2001 Vitam Horm 63, 1-28).</p><p num="p0335">CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL16, CCL18 and fractalkine play an important role in pathophysiological conditions, such as suppression of proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, neoplasia, inflammatory host responses, cancer, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, vasculitis, humoral and cell-mediated immunity responses, leukocyte adhesion and migration processes at the endothelium, inflammatory bowel disease, restenosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertention, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, nephrosclerosis, ventricular remodeling, heart failure, arteriopathy after organ transplantations and failure of vein grafts.

Several cytotoxic T lymphocyte peptide-based vaccines against hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus and melanoma were recently studied in clinical trials. One interesting melanoma vaccine candidate alone or in combination with other tumor antigens, is the decapeptide ELA. This peptide is a Melan-A/MART-1 antigen immunodominant peptide analog, with an N-terminal glutamic acid. It has been reported that the amino group and gamma-carboxylic group of glutamic acids, as well as the amino group and gamma-carboxamide group of glutamines, condense easily to form pyroglutamic derivatives. To overcome this stability problem, several peptides of pharmaceutical interest have been developed with a pyroglutamic acid instead of N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid, without loss of pharmacological properties. Unfortunately compared with ELA, the pyroglutamic acid derivative (PyrELA) and also the N-terminal acetyl-capped derivative (AcELA) failed to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Despite the apparent minor modifications introduced in PyrELA and AcELA, these two derivatives probably have lower affinity than ELA for the specific class I major histocompatibility complex. Consequently, in order to conserve full activity of ELA, the formation of PyrELA must be avoided (Beck A. et al. 2001 , J Pept Res 57(6):528-38.).</p><p num="p0336">Orexin A is a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in the regulation of food intake and sleep-wakefulness, possibly by coordinating the complex behavioral and physiologic responses of these complementary homeostatic functions.

Benzyloxycarbonyl-prolyl- prolinal has been shown to be a specific transition state inhibitor of the enzyme (Wilk, S. and Orloeski, M., J. Neurochem., 41 , 69 (1983), Friedman, et al., Neurochem., 42, 237 (1984)). N-terminal substitutions of L-proline or L-prolylpyrrolidine (Atack, et al., Eur. J. of Pharm., 205, 157-163 (1991), JP 03 56,460, EP 384,341), as well as variations of N-benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) dipeptides containing prolinal at the carboxy terminus have been synthesized as prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors (Nishikata, et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 34(7), 2931-2936 (1986), Baker, A. et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chem. Letts., 1(11), 585-590 (1991)). Thioproline, thiazolidine, and oxopyrrolidine substitutions of the core structure have been reported to inhibit prolyl endopeptidase (Tsuru, et al., J. Biochem., 94, 1179 (1988), Tsuru, et al., J.

Similarly, various modifications of the carboxy terminal proline have been made, including various fluorinated ketone derivatives (Henning, EP 4,912,127). General syntheses of fluorinated ketone derivatives has been described (Angelastro, M.R., et al., Tetrahedron Letters 33(23), 3265-3268 (1992)). Other compounds such as chloromethyl ketone derivatives of acyl-proline or acylpeptide-proline (Z-Gly-Pro-CH<sub>2</sub>CI) have been demonstrated to inhibit the enzyme by alkylating the enzyme's active site (Yoshimoto, T., et al., Biochemistry 16, 2942 (1977)).

IV-inhibitor and/or at least one NPY-receptor-ligand and/or at least one ACE-inhibitor, can be used as the active ingredient(s). The active ingredient(s) is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules, gelcaps and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, though other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included.</p><p num="p0482">Injectable suspensions may also prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed.

Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of each active ingred ient or combinations thereof of the present invention.</p><p num="p0484">The tablets or pills of the compositions of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action.
