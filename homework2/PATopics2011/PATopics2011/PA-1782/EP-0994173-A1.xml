composition. More specifically, the invention relates to a process for making
an automatic transmission fluid composition having high performance at low
and high temperatures.</p><heading><u style="single">II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0002">Automatic transmission fluids are lubricants used in motor vehicle
transmissions. Different types of automatic transmission fluids are used
depending on the design and severity of application. Generally, automatic
transmission fluids are designed to meet specific manufacturer requirements.</p><p num="0003">An automatic transmission is composed of a complex variety of mechanical
parts which operate at close tolerances. The purpose of automatic
transmission fluid is to lubricate these close-fitting parts to reduce wear and
keep down temperature due to friction. To perform this function, the
automatic transmission fluid must maintain its viscosity within certain
specifications. Achieving this function is complicated by the changing
temperatures under which the transmission is operated. It is desirable that an
automatic transmission fluid perform well in all the various temperature
conditions under which the transmission will operate.</p><p num="0004">For example, in a Northern location, the automatic transmission fluid may be
below 32°F prior to use and then heat up to over 300°F during use. Mineral
oil based lubricating oils typically have higher viscosities at lower
temperatures and lower viscosities at higher temperatures. As automatic
transmissions evolve, however, the maximum viscosity at low temperatures is 
reduced since too viscous an automatic transmission fluid will not adequately
flow as needed to actuate the hydraulic valves and other hydraulic
mechanisms of the automatic transmission. Automobile manufacturers have
recently changed their specifications for automatic transmission fluid to
require lower maximum viscosities at low temperatures. The next generation
automatic transmissions will require next generation automatic transmission
fluids, especially to be sure the automatic transmission fluid flows adequately
at low temperatures. For example, new generation automatic transmission
fluids must have Brookfield viscosities at -40°C of less than 10,000 cP,
13,000 cP, or 17,500 cP. Current requirements for automatic transmission
fluids typically only require a Brookfield viscosity at -40°C of less than
20,000 cP.</p><p num="0005">Synthetic lubricants made from polyalphaolefins ("PAO's") and some new
unconventional high viscosity index mineral base oils can be used to meet
these new viscometric requirements. However, those are expensive to
manufacture. It would be advantageous to have a relatively inexpensive
mineral oil-based lubricant that can lower the cost of meeting the new
viscometric requirements. The lubricating composition of the present
invention meets this need.</p><heading><u style="single">III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0006">The invention includes a process of making a lubricating composition
including: contacting a heavy mineral oil feed in a hydrocracking zone with a
hydrocracking catalyst at hydrocracking conditions, whereby at least a portion
of the heavy mineral oil feed is cracked; recovering at least one gasoline-range
fraction and one bottoms fraction from the hydrocracking zone; passing
a first portion of the bottoms fraction including not more than about 67 wt. %
of the bottoms fraction to a dewaxing zone; and passing a second portion of
the bottoms fraction including at least about 33 wt. % of the bottoms fraction
back to the fuels hydrocracker for additional processing; and where the 
bottoms fraction has a viscosity at 100°C of less than about 4.0 cSt;
contacting the first portion of the bottoms fraction with a dewaxing catalyst
under catalytic dewaxing conditions, where at least a portion thereof is
substantially dewaxed; contacting at least a portion of the substantially
dewaxed bottoms fraction with a hydrofinishing catalyst under hydrofinishing
conditions, thereby producing a hydrofinished, dewaxed bottoms fraction; and
removing from the hydrofinished, dewaxed bottoms fraction at least one light
fraction including diesel or jet fuel range material, thereby leaving a heavy
fraction including the lubricating composition having naphthenes content of at
least about 33 wt. %.</p><heading><u style="single">IV. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u></heading><heading>A. <u style="single">Viscometric Performance Specifications</u></heading><p num="0007">The automatic transmission fluids compositions made by the process of the

Bottoms</u></heading><heading>a. <u style="single">Hydrocracker Bottoms</u></heading><p num="0008">The lubricating composition of the invention includes a specially prepared
hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low viscosity index mineral oil. The
term "low viscosity index" mineral oil as used in this specification and
appended claims means mineral oils having viscosity indexes lower than as
set forth below in the section on "high viscosity index" mineral oils. This
hydrocracker-derived; highly naphthenic, low VI mineral oil is prepared by
catalytically dewaxing and hydrofinishing a hydrocracker bottoms fraction.</p><p num="0009">The meaning of the term "hydrocracker bottoms fraction" is generally known
to those skilled in the art. Generally, a hydrocracker bottom fraction has a
boiling point range from about 470°F to about 910°F, e.g., where about
5 wt. % boils at or below about 530°F and, e.g., where 50 wt. % boils at or
below about 675°F. Catalytic dewaxing and hydrofinishing, other than as
utilized in the lubricating composition of this invention, are known generally to
those skilled in the art. Catalytic dewaxing and hydrofinishing are taught, e.g.,
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,591,322; 5,149,421; and 4,181,598, the disclosures of
which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="0010">In fuel hydrocracker processes, certain fractions from the main or vacuum
distillation columns for distilling crude oil are catalytically cracked to obtain
fuels-range molecules. The heaviest fraction, i.e., the bottoms, from the
hydrocracker is typically too heavy for fuels use. It is normally recycled to the
hydrocracker feed for further cracking. The hydrocracker bottoms are
typically also too light for lubrication uses, although this is not always true for 
"once-through" units. Typically, however, hydrocrackers operated to make
fuels will "recycle to extinction" in order to maximize the fuels product output.
In the dewaxing step of the invention, at least a portion of this bottoms fraction
recycle stream is passed to a catalytic dewaxing process.</p><p num="0011">Not more than about 67 wt. % of the recycle stream is passed to the dewaxing
unit. Preferably, not more than about 50 wt. % or not more than 33 wt. % of
the recycle stream is passed to the dewaxing unit. Thus, at least about
33 wt. %, or preferably at least about 50 wt. % or about 67 wt. %, of the
recycle stream is combined with the hydrocracker feed or otherwise returned
to the hydrocracker for additional cracking/processing. The bottoms fraction
in the recycle stream has a viscosity at 100°C which is typical of a
hydrocracker operated in a manner for maximizing production of jet fuel
and/or gasoline. Typically, such viscosity at 100°C is less than about 4.0 cSt
and preferably less than about 3.5 cSt or 3.3 cSt. After catalytic dewaxing
and catalytic hydrofinishing, the base oil has a naphthenes content of at least
23 wt. % or 25 wt. %, preferably at least 33 wt. %, 35 wt. %, or 37 wt. %. The
term "naphthenes content" as used in this specification, including the claims,
means as measured by ASTM D-3238. To meet these special parameters,
the hydrocracker will typically need to be operated in a manner typically
consistent with optimizing fuels production.</p><p num="0012">This is in contrast to a hydrocracker operated specifically for lubes production.
A hydrocracker operated specifically for lubes production would have no
recycle to the hydrocracker feed, a higher viscosity of the bottoms, and lower
naphthenes content. This is because further cracking of the molecules
reduces viscosity and molecular weight down to levels which are undesirable
for lubes. It has been unexpectedly discovered, however, that using
hydrocracker bottoms from a fuels hydrocracker operated primarily for fuels
production gives unexpectedly useful properties to the bottoms, especially
when mixed with other base oils and with VI improvers. </p><p num="0013">In that process, the bottoms fraction is contacted with an, optionally,
conventional dewaxing catalyst at catalytic dewaxing conditions, whereby at
least a portion of the bottoms fraction is dewaxed. At least a portion of the
resulting dewaxed effluent from the catalytic dewaxing process is then passed
to catalytic hydrofinishing process for removal of sulfur, nitrogen, and
aromatics. In the hydrofinishing process, the dewaxed effluent from the
catalytic dewaxing process is contacted with an, optionally, conventional
hydrofinishing catalyst at catalytic hydrofinishing conditions, whereby at least
a portion of the sulfur, nitrogen, and/or aromatics is removed.</p><p num="0014">The hydrofinished effluent is then fractionated by any conventional
fractionation process, thereby producing at least one lighter fraction and one
heavier fraction. At least a portion of the lighter fraction is high purity, low
pour point diesel fuel/jet fuel. At least a portion of the heavier fraction is a
hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low viscosity index base oil for use
in the automatic transmission fluid of this invention.</p><heading>b. <u style="single">Catalytic Dewaxing</u></heading><p num="0015">The dewaxing process is conducted at catalytic dewaxing conditions. Such
conditions are known and are taught for example in U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,591,322; 5,149,421; and 4,181,598, the disclosures of which are
incorporated herein by reference. The catalytic dewaxing conditions are
dependent in large measure on the feed used and upon the desired pour
point. Hydrogen is preferably present in the reaction zone during the catalytic
dewaxing process. The hydrogen to feed ratio, i.e., hydrogen circulation rate,
is typically between about 500 and about 30,000 SCF/bbl (standard cubic feet
per barrel), preferably about 1000 to about 20,000 SCF/bbl. Generally,
hydrogen will be separated from the product and recycled to the reaction
zone. </p><p num="0016">Catalyst bed arrangements suitable for use in dewaxing step of the invention
are any conventional catalyst bed configuration. The catalytic dewaxing
conditions employed depend on the feed used and the desired pour point.</p><p num="0017">Generally, the process conditions for dewaxing processes are as follows: the
temperature is from about 200°C and about 475°C, preferably between about
250°C and about 450°C. The pressure is typically from about 15 psig and
about 3000 psig, preferably between about 200 psig and 3000 psig. The
liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) preferably will be from 0.1 to 20,
preferably between about 0.2 and 10.</p><p num="0018">Hydrogen is preferably present in the reaction zone during the process. The
hydrogen to feed ratio is typically between about 500 and about
30,000 SCF/bbl (standard cubic feet per barrel), preferably from about 1000 to
about 20,000 SCF/bbl. Generally, hydrogen will be separated from the
product and recycled to the reaction zone.</p><p num="0019">Suitable aluminosilicate zeolite dewaxing catalysts for use in the dewaxing
step of the invention include, e.g., ZSM-48, SSZ-32, other dewaxing-capable
zeolites, and mixtures thereof. These are taught in R. Szostak, <i>Handbook of
Molecular Sieves</i> (Van Norstrand Reinhold 1992), at pages 551-553 and
172-174, which are incorporated herein by reference, and in U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,053,373; 4,397,827; 4,537,754; and 4,593,138, the disclosures of
which are incorporated herein by reference. Where two or more zeolite
catalysts are employed, they are mixed in an effective weight ratio to enhance
dewaxing. Preferred ratios for two zeolites are from about 1:5 to about 20:1.</p><p num="0020">Any zeolite used in the process may optionally contain a hydrogenation
component of the type commonly employed in dewaxing catalysts. See the
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,910,006 and U.S. Patent No. 5,316,753 for
examples of these hydrogenation components, the disclosures of which are
incorporated herein by reference. </p><p num="0021">The hydrogenation component is present in an effective amount to provide an
effective hydrodewaxing catalyst preferably in the range of from about 0.01 to
10% by weight, more preferably from about 0.05 to 5% by weight. The
catalyst system may be run in such a mode to increase dewaxing at the
expense of cracking reactions.</p><p num="0022">Layered catalyst systems also may be used. For example, the catalyst
system may have a first layer including, e.g., zeolite SSZ-32, and at least one
Group VIII metal, and a second layer comprising another aluminosilicate
zeolite, e.g., one which is more shape selective than zeolite SSZ-32. The use
of layered catalysts is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,149,421, issued
September 22, 1992 to Miller, which is incorporated by reference herein in its
entirety. The layering may also include a shape-selective molecular sieve
bed, e.g., SSZ-31, SSZ-32, SSZ-41, SSZ-43, ZSM-5, ZSM-12, SAPO-11,
SAPO-31, SAPO-40, SAPO-41, UDT-1, layered with a different component
designed for either hydrocracking or hydrofinishing, or any other catalyst
having dewaxing activity with bright stocks. Intimately mixed catalyst systems
represent another useful variant on this concept.</p><p num="0023">The aluminosilicate zeolite catalyst preferably contains one or more
Group VIII metals or other transition metals such as platinum, palladium,
molybdenum, nickel, vanadium, cobalt, tungsten, zinc, and mixtures thereof.
More preferably, the intermediate pore size aluminosilicate zeolite catalyst
contains at least one Group VIII metal selected from the group consisting of
platinum and palladium. Most preferably, the intermediate pore size
aluminosilicate zeolite catalyst contains platinum.</p><p num="0024">The amount of metal ranges from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the
molecular sieve, preferably from about 0.2% to about 5%, based on the
weight of the molecular sieve. The techniques of introducing catalytically
active metals to a molecular sieve are disclosed in the literature, and
pre-existing metal incorporation techniques and treatment of the molecular 
sieve to form an active catalyst such as ion exchange, impregnation or
occlusion during sieve preparation are suitable for use in the present process.
Such techniques are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,236,761; 3,226,339;
3,236,762; 3,620,960; 3,373,109; 4,202,996; 4,440,781 and 4,710,485, the
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="0025">Catalysts useful in the dewaxing step typically comprise an active material
and a support or binder. The support for the catalysts of this invention may be
the same as the active material and further can be a synthetic or naturally
occurring substance as well as an inorganic material such as clay, silica
and/or one or more metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring
or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and
metal oxides.</p><p num="0026">Naturally occurring clays which can be used as support for the catalysts
include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include
the subbentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee,
Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is
halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in
the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid
treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the
catalysts used in the dewaxing step of this invention may be supported on a
porous binder or matrix material, such as titania, zirconia, silica-magnesia,
silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-berylia, silica-titania, titania-zirconia, as well
as a ternary compound such as silica-magnesia-zirconia. A mixture of these
components could also be used.</p><p num="0027">The support may be in the form of a cogel. One binder that is suitable is a low
acidity titania prepared from a mixture comprising a low acidity titanium oxide
binder material and an aqueous slurry of titanium oxide hydrate. Other
binders include alumina and alumina-containing materials such as silica-alumina,
silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia, and silica-alumina-magnesia. 
Typical aluminas include alpha (alpha) alumina, beta (beta)
alumina, gamma (gamma) alumina, chi-eta-rho (chi, eta, rho) alumina, delta
(delta) alumina, theta (theta) alumina, and lanthanum beta (beta) alumina.
The preferred support is one that is a high surface area material that also
possesses a high temperature stability and further possesses a high oxidation
stability.</p><p num="0028">The binder may be prepared according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,430,000,
incorporated by reference herein, or may be prepared according to methods
disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,631,267; 4,631,268; 4,637,995; and 4,657,880,
each incorporated by reference herein. Also, the catalysts described herein
may be combined with any of the binder precursors described in the above
patents, and then may be formed, such as by extrusion, into the shape
desired, and then finished in a humidified atmosphere as hereinafter
described.</p><heading>c. <u style="single">Hydrofinishing</u></heading><p num="0029">The mild hydrogenation step, hydrofinishing step, is beneficial in preparing an
acceptably stable hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low VI base oil
since unsaturated products tend to be unstable to air and light and tend to
degrade. Hydrofinishing is typically conducted at temperatures ranging from
about 190°C to about 340°C, at pressures of from about 400 psig to about
3000 psig, at space velocities (LHSV) of from about 0.1 to about 20, and
hydrogen recycle rates of from about 400 to about 15000 SCF/bbl. The
hydrogenation catalyst employed must be active enough not only to
hydrogenate the olefins and diolefins within the lube oil fractions, but also to
reduce the content of any aromatics (color bodies) present.</p><p num="0030">Suitable hydrogenation catalysts include conventional, metallic hydrogenation
catalysts, particularly the Group VIII metals such as cobalt, nickel, palladium
and platinum. The metals are typically associated with carriers such as 
bauxite, alumina, silica gel, silica-alumina composites, and crystalline
aluminosilicate zeolites and other molecular sieves. Palladium, platinum, and
mixtures thereof are particularly preferred hydrogenation metals. If desired,
non-noble Group VIII metals can be used with molybdates or tungstates.
Metal oxides, e.g., nickel/cobalt promoters, or sulfides can be used. Suitable
catalysts are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,852,207; 4,157,294; 4,921,594;
3,904,513 and 4,673,487, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by
reference.</p><heading>2. <u style="single">High Viscosity Index Base Oil</u></heading><p num="0031">The lubricating oil base oil mixture of the invention contains one or more high
viscosity index mineral oils. Such high viscosity index mineral oils are
paraffinic. The terms "high viscosity index" mineral oil and "unconventional
mineral base oil" do not have strict definitions. In general, they refer to
mineral base oils having desirable viscometric properties not typically found in
mineral oils and generally only available in expensive synthetic base oils. The
marketplace recognizes the desirability of viscometric properties of high-viscosity
index and unconventional mineral oils in that they command a higher
price than "conventional" mineral oils. Thus, the relative price is also an
indicator of unconventional and high viscosity index base oils. To avoid
ambiguity, the term "high viscosity index" mineral oil as used in this
specification and appended claims means (1) a viscosity index of at least 90
for a mineral oil having a viscosity of 3.0 centistokes at 100°C; (2) a viscosity
index of at least 105 for a mineral oil having a viscosity of 4 centistokes at
100°C; (3) a viscosity index of at least 115 for a mineral oil having a viscosity
of 5.0 centistokes at 100°C; and (4) a viscosity index of at least 120 for a
mineral oil having a viscosity of 7.0 centistokes at 100°C. "High" viscosity
indices for other viscosities between 3.0 and 7.0 can be determined by
conventional interpolation. </p><p num="0032">The viscosity indices of the high VI base oils used in the present invention are
much higher than those commonly used in the industry. The "high viscosity
index" base oils used in the present invention are also referred to as
"Unconventional Base Oils". The preferred method of manufacture for the
Unconventional Base Oils is a combination of hydrocracking followed by
catalytic dewaxing. Two such processes for preferred base oil manufacture
are licensed under the names of ISOCRACKING and ISODEWAXING.</p><heading>3. <u style="single">Other Low Viscosity Index Base Oil</u></heading><p num="0033">One or more embodiments of the invention include a conventional low
viscosity index mineral oil, i.e., one other than hydrocracker-derived, highly
naphthenic, low VI base oil discussed above. The term "conventional" as
used in this specification means previously known or used in the lubes art.</p><p num="0034">Preferred embodiments of the lubricating composition of the invention contain
one high VI mineral oil and one low VI mineral oil, where the low VI mineral oil
is obtained from hydrocracker bottoms as described above. In one
embodiment, the high viscosity index mineral oil has a viscosity of at least
about 5.0 cSt at 100°C. The low VI mineral oil has a viscosity of at least
about 3.0 cSt at 100°C. More preferably, the high viscosity index mineral oil
has a viscosity of at least about 6.5 cSt at 100°C and the low viscosity index
mineral oil has a viscosity of at least 3.7 cSt at 100°C. The weight ratio of the
high VI mineral oil to the low VI mineral oil is from about 0:100 to about 90:10,
preferably from about 80:20 to about 20:80, or from 70:30 to about 30:70, or
from about 60:40 to about 40:60.</p><p num="0035">The base oil mixture of the invention provides for good low temperature
performance while maintaining a minimum oil film thickness to protect moving
parts such as bearings and gears. The low VI mineral oil component enables
the finished oil to achieve a low pour point and a maximum Brookfield
viscosity as set forth in the respective viscometric performance specifications 
shown in Tables 1-4 above. The high VI mineral oil component provides the
necessary oil film thickness to protect moving parts at high temperatures.
Neither base oil component alone would impart all season properties to the
finished oil.</p><p num="0036">The viscosity index improver is one component or, optionally, a blend of two
or more components. The VI improvers optionally have a shear stability index
of less than about 30. The terms "sheared", "shear stability index (SSI)", and
"shear stability" as used in this specification and appended claims each mean
as measured by the Sonic Shear Method as set forth in ASTM Test D-5621.
The shear stability index is calculated as follows:
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">SSI = (Vi-Vf)*100/(Vi-Vb),</st32:df>
where Vi is the initial viscosity in centistokes at 100°C of the fresh, unsheared
automatic transmission fluid; Vf is the final viscosity in centistokes at 100°C of
the automatic transmission fluid after the 40-minute D-5621 shear procedure;
and Vb is the viscosity in centistokes at 100°C of the automatic transmission
fluid base mixture without the viscosity index improvers added.</p><p num="0037">The total VI improver content is from about 2 to 14 wt. %. The VI improver(s),
whether present individually or in combination, are present in sufficient
amounts so that said automatic transmission fluid composition has the
viscometric properties of one or more of the sets of viscometric performance
specifications shown in Tables 1-4 above.</p><p num="0038">Polymethacrylate viscosity index improvers are commercially available. The
lubricating composition will typically include a performance additive package.
The term "performance additive package" as used in this specification and
appended claims means any combination of other conventional additives for
lubricating compositions. Such additives include corrosion and rust inhibitors,
anti-oxidants, dispersants, detergents, anti-foam agents, anti-wear agents,
friction modifiers and flow improvers. Such additives are described in 
"Lubricants and Related Products" by Dieter Klamann, Verlag Chemie,
Deerfield Beach, Fla., 1984.</p><heading><u style="single">V. ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</u></heading><p num="0039">The invention will be further clarified by the following Illustrative Embodiments,

effects of various mixtures of components. In particular, the effect of adding
Low Viscosity Index Base Oil A<sub>1</sub> is of interest, i.e., a hydrocracker-derived,
highly naphthenic, low VI base oil of the invention. In Table 5, the
concentration of Low Viscosity Index Base Oil A<sub>1</sub>, in mixture with Low
Viscosity Index Base Oil B, was steadily increased over 4 test runs. The
results show that increasing the concentration of Low Viscosity Index Base Oil
A<sub>1</sub> resulted in a decreased Brookfield Viscosity at -40°C, increased VI, and
decreased Viscosity at 100°C. In Table 5, runs 2 and 3 meet the viscometric
performance specifications shown in Table 2 above.</p><p num="0042">In Table 6 and 7, the concentration of Low Viscosity Index Base Oil A<sub>1</sub>, in

performance specifications shown in Table 2 above. <img id="img-00210001" orientation="unknown" wi="144" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00210001.tif" inline="no" he="237"/></p><p num="0044">Table 8 shows the higher naphthenes content of one embodiment of the
hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low VI mineral base oil of the
invention in comparison to other commercially available catalytically dewaxed
base oils and one solvent dewaxed base oil. Base oils M, N, O, and P are
ATF base oils made from hydrocrackers. Their naphthene content is much
lower than in the hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low VI mineral
base oil of the invention. The naphthenes content of base oil Q is close to
that of the hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low VI mineral base oil of
the invention. However, base oil Q is a solvent refined ATF base oil and so
also has higher aromatics content which is undesirable since that tends to
cause poor oxidation stability. <img id="img-00230001" orientation="unknown" wi="154" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00230001.tif" inline="no" he="222"/></p><p num="0045">Table 9 shows how the viscometric performance of the hydrocracker-derived,
highly naphthenic, low viscosity index base oil of the invention compares with
the viscometric performance of a solvent dewaxed low viscosity index base oil
having a similar naphthenes content (i.e., Low VI Oil Q in Table 8). Even
though the solvent dewaxed base oil has a similar naphthenes content and
has a slightly higher VI and viscosity, its viscometric properties are not as
good for making ATF as the hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low
viscosity index base oil of the invention, i.e., a Brookfield viscosity of 18,120
versus 34,350. This is surprising behavior which is believed to be due at least
in part to an unexpected beneficial effect of Isocracking and Isodewaxing
compared to solvent refining.</p><p num="0046">If we change the VI Improver, as in runs 3 and 4, we can further improve the
viscometric performance of the hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low
viscosity index base oil of the invention so that the Brookfield viscosity meets
at least one of our preferred embodiments, i.e., the performance
specifications in Tables 1-4 above. As shown, run 1 is very close to meeting
the target viscometric performance specifications shown in Table 2 above. In
comparison, blend 2, the solvent-dewaxed base oil, is far from it. Blends 3
and 4 each meet the target viscometric performance specifications shown in
Table 2 above. <img id="img-00250001" orientation="unknown" wi="140" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00250001.tif" inline="no" he="236"/></p><p num="0047">The results in Table 10 show what was known, i.e., that a high VI oil can
make a very good ATF. Table 10 also shows results that were unexpected
however. By adding increasing amounts of the hydrocracker-derived, highly
naphthenic, low viscosity index base oil of the invention, we can continue to
make good ATF. As we add more of the hydrocracker-derived, highly
naphthenic, low viscosity index base oil of the invention, we need to use more
VI Improver to maintain a satisfactory Brookfield viscosity. Since the
manufacturing cost of the high VI base oil is higher than the manufacturing
cost of the hydrocracker-derived, highly naphthenic, low viscosity index base
oil of the invention, it is unexpected that we can use the hydrocracker-derived,
highly naphthenic, low viscosity index base oil of the invention as a blending
component to reduce the cost of the finished ATF.</p><p num="0048">As shown, each blend in Table 10 meets either the target viscometric
