temperature than conventional novolac curing agents and with reduced emission of
volatile compounds is disclosed. The novolac curing agent polymer composition is
prepared by mixing and reacting in aqueous solution a phenolic monomer and an
aldehyde in the presence of a basic catalyst to forum an intermediate resin, and
reacting the intermediate resin with an amine to form the polymer composition. The
aldehyde to phenolic monomer molar ratio in the reaction should be at least about
1.0:1, and preferably is at least about 2.0:1. The preferred amine is
hexamethylenetetramine, and it is preferred that the hexamethylenetetramine to
phenolic monomer molar ratio is at least about 0.12:1. In a preferred version, the
aldehyde is formaldehyde, and the phenolic monomer is selected from the group
consisting of phenol, substituted phenols, and mixtures thereof, with phenol itself
being the most preferred phenolic monomer. The polymer is particularly
advantageous in that the reaction temperature is lowered compared to other
conventional curing agents, the unreacted phenolic monomer in the polymer
composition may be adjusted to levels less than about 0.5 weight percent, and the
unreacted aldehyde in the polymer composition may be adjusted to levels less than
about 0.1 weight percent. As a result, the polymer releases minimal volatile
compounds when used to cure novolac resins, and unlike conventional resole curing
agents, has an indefinite shelf life in both the pure form and when blended with a
novolac resins.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading><p num="0001">This invention relates to a polymer composition that is useful for curing
novolac resins. The polymer composition exhibits reduced emissions of ammonia
compared to conventional novolac curing agents such as
hexamethylenetetramine, and exhibits higher reactivity compared to conventional
novolac curing agents. Furthermore, the polymer composition can be stored for
extended times without loss of reactivity.</p><heading>2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p num="0002">For some time, phenolic resins have been used in applications as diverse
as molding compositions, surface coatings, adhesives, laminating resins, casting
resins and binders. In the plastics molding field, phenolic resins have been a
preferred choice as a molding material for precision moldings that must function in
hostile environments because phenolic resins react to form cross-linked
structures with excellent dimensional, chemical and thermal stability at elevated
temperature.</p><p num="0003">Phenolic resins are thermosetting resins produced by the condensation of
an aromatic alcohol with an aldehyde wherein water is produced as a byproduct.
Typically, the aromatic alcohol is phenol and the aldehyde is formaldehyde, but
substituted phenols and higher aldehydes have been used to produce phenolic
resins with specific properties such as reactivity and flexibility. The variety of
phenolic resins available is quite large as the aldehyde to aromatic alcohol ratio,
the reaction temperature and the catalyst selected can be varied,</p><p num="0004">Phenolic resins fall into two broad classes: resole (single stage) resins and
novolac (two stage) resins. Resole resins are typically produced with a phenol, a
molar excess of formaldehyde and an alkaline catalyst. The reaction is controlled
to create a non-cross-linked resin that is cured by heat without additional catalysts
to form a three dimensional cross-linked insoluble, infusible polymer. In contrast,
novolac resins are typically produced with formaldehyde, a molar excess of 
phenol, and an acid catalyst. The reaction produces a thermoplastic polymer that
can be melted but will not cross-link upon the application of heat alone. The
resulting novolac thermoplastic resin can be cross-linked by the addition of a
novolac curing agent.</p><p num="0005">Several curing agents for novolac resins are known in the art, including
formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde and hexamethylenetetramine. The most
common curing agent is hexamethylenetetramine, which reacts upon heating to
yield ammonia and cured resin. These curing agents complete the cross-linking
reaction to convert a thermoplastic novolac resin to an insoluble infusible state.
However, it has been recognized in the art that each of these novolac curing
agents has certain disadvantages. For instance, where hexamethylenetetramine
or formaldehyde are used to cure a novolac resin, volatile reaction products are
emitted during the cure reaction. Specifically, when the curative is
hexamethylenetetramine, ammonia evolves during curing of the novolac resin. In
addition, novolac curing agents like hexamethylenetetramine typically require
curing temperatures as high as 150°C. Cure temperatures can be lowered by the
addition of acids, but this often introduces other problems such as die staining,
die sticking and sublimation of organic acids into the atmosphere.</p><p num="0006">Melamine resins have also been used as a curing agent for novolac resins.
(See, for example. U.S. Patent No. 5,648.404.) However, there are also
disadvantages in the use of melamine resins as a curing agent. For instance, it
has been recognized that melamine resins typically require either an acid catalyst
or elevated temperatures to cure a novolac resin. Also, melamine resin curing
agents tend to cure novolac resins more slowly than hexamethylenetetramine and
tend to produce a lesser extent of cure, and frequently produce formaldehyde as
a side reaction.</p><p num="0007">Resole resins have also been used as a curing agent for novolac resins.
(See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,745,024.) However, there are significant
drawbacks with resole resins. First, resole resins have a limited shelf life which
can severely limit product reactivity after a resole resin has been stored for a
period of time as short as three months. In addition, resole resins have an even 
shorter shelf life when mixed with a novolac resin. The limited shelf life is caused
by self-condensation in the resole resin wherein phenolic nuclei are bridged by
methylene groups. Accordingly, resole resin curing agents may not be suitable
for manufacturers that wish to purchase resole curing agents in large quantities
and place the resole curing agents in inventory for later use. A second drawback
with resole resins is that they may contain significant free phenol and
formaldehyde levels that may present environmental concerns for some
manufacturers. Specifically, conventional resole resins typically contain 4-6% free
phenol and may contain free formaldehyde levels of approximately 1%. A final
disadvantage of using resole resins to cure a novolac resin is that a fairly large
amount of resole is required to achieve a reasonable crosslink density, Typical
formulas are 50% resole or more.</p><p num="0008">Because of the recognized disadvantages with formaldehyde,
hexamethylenetetramine, melamine resin and resole resin novolac curing agents,
there has been a search for alternative novolac resin curing agents. One
proposed alternative novolac resin curing agent is a benzoxaxine polymer
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,910,521. However, it is believed that this polymer
may not present an optimum cost effective alternative to known novolac curing
agents.</p><p num="0009">Therefore, there is a continued need for other altemative novolac resin
curing agents that emit limited volatile compounds, such as ammonia, during the
novolac cure reaction, that have low levels of free phenol and formaldehyde, that
have extended shelf life, and that have lower temperatures for cure activation.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0010">The foregoing needs In the art are met by a polymer composition in
accordance with the present invention that can be used to cure a novolac resin at
a lower temperature than conventional novolac curing agents and with only
limited emissions of volatile compounds. A polymer composition in accordance
with the present invention also retains reactivity over extended storage times.</p><p num="0011">A polymer composition in accordance with the present invention is useful
for curing a novolac resin, and comprises the product of mixing and reacting in 
aqueous solution a phenolic monomer and an aldehyde in the presence of a basic
catalyst to form an intermediate resin, and reacting the intermediate resin with an
amine to form the polymer composition. The aldehyde to phenolic monomer
molar ratio in the reaction should be at least about 1.0:1, and preferably is at least
about 2.0:1. The preferred amine is hexamethylenetetramine, and it is preferred
that the hexamethylenetetramine to phenolic monomer molar ratio be at least
about 0.12:1. In a preferred version of the invention, the aldehyde is
formaldehyde, and the phenolic monomer is selected from the group consisting of
phenol, substituted phenols, and mixtures thereof, with phenol itself being the
most preferred phenolic monomer.</p><p num="0012">The unreacted phenolic monomer in a polymer composition in accordance
with the present invention may be adjusted to levels less than about 3.0 weight
percent. Preferably, the unreacted phenolic monomer in the polymer
composition is less than about 1.0 weight percent, and most preferably, the
unreacted phenolic monomer in the polymer composition is less than 0.5 weight
percent. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that by reacting a
phenolic monomer with a molar excess of an aldehyde and an amine, the amine
keeps the reaction mixture from quickly gelling thereby allowing higher levels of
the aldehyde to be introduced into the reaction mixture. The increased levels of
aldehyde serve to lower the free phenol levels.</p><p num="0013">The low unreacted phenolic monomer levels of the polymer composition
can be particularly advantageous for manufacturers that presently use
conventional resoles for curing novolac resins. For instance, it is well known that
conventional resole curing agents typically contain 4-6% free phenol and that
phenol emissions and discharges are regulated by certain environmental
protection agencies. When a novolac resin is cured with a resole, the free
phenol may be liberated as a gas during curing, or may be discharged into
process water in the case of slurry molding processes. As a result,
manufacturers often must use pollution control equipment to control phenol
emissions and discharges and comply with various regulations. By replacing a
conventional resole with the polymer curing agent of the present invention, a 
manufacturer may be able to comply with environmental regulations without the
use of pollution control equipment. However, it should be appreciated that the
polymer composition is also effective at curing novolac resins when the unreacted
phenolic monomer in the composition is greater than about 3.0 weight percent.</p><p num="0014">The unreacted aldehyde in a polymer composition in accordance with the
present invention may be adjusted to levels less than about 0.1 weight percent.
This is also particularly advantageous in that the formaldehyde levels in many
products are subject to various environmental regulations including reporting
requirements. By replacing a conventional resole with the polymer curing agent
of the present invention, a manufacturer may be able to more easily comply with
certain environmental regulations. The reduced levels of phenolic monomer and
formaldehyde in the polymer may also reduce the odors emitted by products
molded with a composition including a novolac resin and the polymer curing
agent.</p><p num="0015">In addition, the polymer of the invention, unlike conventional resole curing
agents, has an indefinite shelf life in both the pure form and when blended with
novolac resins. Experimental data indicates that samples of the polymer will
remain essentially unchanged for over a year. Without intending to be bound by
theory, it is believed that by reacting a phenolic monomer with a molar excess of
an aldehyde and an amine, the available crosslinking sites in the polymer are
depleted, yielding a substantially inactive polymer. An unexpected result is that
the substantially inactive curing agent polymer of the invention lowers the cure
temperature of a novolac resin compared to novolac resins cured with other
conventional novolac resin curing agents. Another unexpected result is that the
amount of curing agent required for cure is less than the amount of conventional
resole resin required for a similar degree of cure. This is particularly
advantageous in that resole resins can be quite expensive due to the smaller
batch sizes used in production and lower yields.</p><p num="0016">In one application of the curing agent polymer of the present invention, an
effective amount of the polymer is mixed with a solid novolac resin or a solution of
a novolac resin to replace conventional curing agents. An effective amount is the 
amount of the crosslinking polymer composition required to yield the desired
extent of cure. The resulting curable novolac composition may then be cured in
the conventional manner. Optionally, the curable novolac composition prepared
with the curing agent polymer composition of the present invention may include
an additional curing agent that supplies methylene bridging groups, such as
hexamethylenetetramine. In this application, the polymer of the invention also
acts as a cure accelerator and a flow modifier.</p><p num="0017">In another application of the curing agent polymer of the present invention,
an effective amount of the polymer is mixed with a solid or liquid novolac resin
and at least one filler to produce a curable composition. Novolac resins and fillers
commonly used in curable compositions are suitable for use in this application of
the polymer of the invention. Non-limiting examples of fillers are glass fibers,
carbon fibers, graphite fibers, ceramic fibers, mica, days, talcs, cellulosic fibers
such as wood flour and cotton fibers, organic fibers such as aromatic polyamide
fibers, as well as ground, cured phenolic resins and compounds.</p><p num="0018">It is therefore an advantage of the present invention to provide a curing
agent for novolac resins.</p><p num="0019">It is another advantage of the present invention to provide a curing agent
for novolac resins that lowers the cure temperature of the novolac resin compared
to novolac resins cured with other conventional novolac resin curing agents.</p><p num="0020">It is a further advantage of the present invention to provide a curing agent
for novolac resins that does not lose reactivity when stored alone or when stored
admixed-with a novolac resin.</p><p num="0021">It is yet another advantage of the present invention to provide a curing
agent for novolac resins that is stable when the curing agent and a novolac resin
are blended before curing and may be used with molding compositions including
conventional fillers.</p><p num="0022">It is still another advantage of the present invention to provide a curing
agent for novolac resins that releases limited quantities of ammonia when the
curing agent and a novolac resin are blended together and cured.</p><p num="0023">It is a further advantage of the present invention to provide a curing agent 
for novolac resins that contains extremely small amounts of free phenol.</p><p num="0024">It Is yet another advantage of the present invention to provide a curing
agent for novolac resins that contains extremely small amounts of free
formaldehyde.</p><p num="0025">It is still another advantage of the present invention to provide a curing
agent for novolac resins that assists in the production of a cured novolac resin
that releases limited odors.</p><p num="0026">These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present
invention will become better understood upon consideration of the following
detailed description, drawings, and appended claims.</p><heading><u style="single">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></heading><p num="0027">Figure 1 is a differential scanning calorimetry graph of a novolac resin
cured with a polymer composition in accordance with the invention; and</p><p num="0028">Figure 2 is a differential scanning calorimetry graph of a novolac resin
cured with another polymer composition in accordance with the invention.</p><heading><u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0029">A preferred procedure for making a novolac curing agent polymer
composition in accordance with the invention involves blending a phenolic
monomer with an aldehyde source and enough water to keep the mixture fluid.
The mixture is then cooled to a safe temperature (typically less than 40°C) and a
neutral or basic catalyst is added to the mixture. The temperature of the mixture
is raised to react the phenolic monomer and the aldehyde to obtain an
intermediate resin. At this point, an acid may be added to neutralize any basic
catalyst. A reactive amine is then added to the intermediate resin and reacted
until the amine is sufficiently consumed, Water may then be removed to obtain a
desired viscosity. Solvents can also be added to obtain the desired fluid
properties. If a solid polymer is desired, water and other volatiles are removed
and the molten resin is heated until the resin has the desired melt point. The
resin is then rapidly cooled. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in a reaction
vessel equipped with a heater, a mixer, and a reflux condenser connected to a
vacuum source. During the reaction, the heater and vacuum are manipulated so 
that the reaction mixture refluxes at a desired reaction temperature. Water and
other volatiles may be removed by vacuum distillation.</p><p num="0030">In the preferred procedure for making the novolac curing agent polymer
composition, the reaction times and temperatures may vary and are somewhat
dependent on the basic catalyst selected. The purpose of preparing the
intermediate resin is to consume the phenolic monomer and to tie in the aldehyde
so that it is not lost during distillation. The extent of reaction is a function of the
reaction time and temperature. Longer reaction times are required for lower
reaction temperatures. For example, when the phenolic monomer is phenol, the
aldehyde is formaldehyde, and the basic catalyst is calcium hydroxide, typical
reaction temperatures and reaction times may vary from 2-6 hours at 70°C to
20-60 minutes at 90°C.</p><p num="0031">If a liquid novolac curing agent polymer composition in accordance with the
invention is desired, the intermediate resin should have a lower extent of
reaction. Water is removed just until the desired viscosity is obtained. Typically,
the final viscosity is in the range of 5 poise to 500 poise. A liquid novolac curing
agent polymer composition in accordance with the invention can also be obtained
by adding a suitable solvent to the resin such as methanol, ethylene glycol or the
like. If a solid novolac curing agent polymer composition in accordance with the
invention is desired, the final reaction after adding the amine must be at a higher
temperature than the target melt point. At higher reaction temperatures, the
target melt point will be reached in less time. For practical handling, the softening
point of a solid novolac curing agent polymer composition in accordance with the
invention should be above 70°C. Typical softening points range from 70°C to
120°C.</p><p num="0032">In the preferred procedure for making the novolac curing agent polymer
composition, the term "phenolic monomer" and the term "aldehyde" each have
established meanings of scope in the art of phenolic resins and are used
throughout this disclosure and claims in accordance with their art established
meanings. Thus, the "phenolic monomer" can be a phenol, a substituted phenol,
a mixture of substituted phenols, or a mixture of phenol and substituted phenols. 
A preferred phenolic monomer is phenol itself. Non-limiting examples of
substituted phenols are cresol isomers, resorcinol, xylenol isomers, cardanol, and
the like. Similarly, the term "aldehyde" has reference to organic compounds
containing the characteristic group: R-CHO. Preferably, the aldehyde is aqueous
formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde. Non-limiting examples of other suitable
aldehydes include: aliphatic aldehydes, such as propionic aldehyde,
butylaldehyde, acetaldehyde and the like; aromatic aldehydes such as
benzaldehyde and the like; cyclic aldehydes such as furfural and the like; and
mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0033">The neutral or basic catalyst may be a mineral base such as an alkali metal
hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, an alkali metal oxide, or an alkaline
earth metal oxide. Non-limiting examples include: calcium hydroxide, magnesium
oxide, barium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and lithium
hydroxide. The basic catalyst may also be an organic base such as ammonia,
hexamethylenetetramine, trishydroxymethylaminomethane, and the like. The
mole ratio of the basic catalyst to the phenolic monomer is preferably about
0.01:1 to about 0.03:1. The acid may be any acid suitable for neutralizing the
basic catalyst. Non-limiting examples are oxalic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric
acid, and nitric acid. The reactive amine may be hexamethylenetetramine,
ammonia, or a source of ammonia.</p><p num="0034">The total aldehyde to total phenolic monomer molar ratio should be at least
about 1.0:1, but if less than 1% unreacted phenolic monomer is desired in the
final novolac curing agent polymer composition in accordance with the invention,
the total aldehyde to total phenolic monomer molar ratio should not be less than
about 2:1. It should be appreciated that the total aldehyde to total phenolic
monomer ratio refers to the total amount of phenolic monomer present before a
reaction, including any mixture of phenols.</p><p num="0035">The total amine to total phenolic monomer molar ratio controls the
reactivity of the final novolac curing agent polymer composition. When the amine
is hexamethylenetetramine, a measurable boost in reactivity with a novolac resin,
compared to the reactivity of a standard resole towards the same novolac resin, 
can be obtained with a total amine to total phenolic monomer molar ratio of at
least about 0.12:1. Higher total amine to total phenolic monomer molar ratios
increase the reactivity. At total amine to total phenolic monomer molar ratios
higher than about 0.25:1, unreacted amine becomes detectable but reactivity
continues to increase. When the amine is ammonia, the total amine to total
phenolic monomer molar ratios must be four times larger than when the amine is
hexamethylenetetramine, i.e., at least about 0.48:1.</p><p num="0036">A novolac curing agent polymer composition in accordance with the
invention may be stored separately for later blending with a novolac resin. or may
be blended in an effective amount with a novolac resin to form a curable novolac
composition. Preferably, the curable novolac composition includes about 20
weight percent to about 98 weight percent of the novolac resin and about 2 weight
percent to about 80 weight percent of the polymer composition in accordance with
the invention. The curable novolac composition may also include a curing agent
that supplies methylene bridging groups such as hexamethylenetetramine.
Preferably, the curing agent is hexamethylenetetramine and is present in the

in accordance with the present invention is advantageous when employed as a
curing agent for novolac resins. It is particularly advantageous in that the polymer
may be used to crosslink a novolac resin without the addition of 
hexamethylenetetramine and with no hexamethylenetetramine detected by water
extraction. The polymer accelerates the cure of a novolac resin, compared to
hexamethylenetetramine due to a lower temperature cure onset and a lower
temperature cure peak. The polymer also accelerates the cure of a novolac resin,
compared to conventional resole resins due to a lower temperature cure peak. The
polymer also accelerates the cure of a novolac resin already containing
hexamethylenetetramine by lowering the cure onset and cure peak temperatures,</p><p num="0082">In order to show the effects that the level of hexamethylenetetramine in the

hexamethylenetetramine to phenol monomer mole ratio of 0.18). Looking first at
Figure 1, it can be seen that a lower cure peak appears at 135.78°C when the amine
to phenolic monomer mole ratio in the polymer is 0.11. As the amine to phenolic
monomer mole ratio in the polymer is increased to 0.18 as in Figure 2, the lower cure
peak at 135.8°C becomes greater.</p><heading><u style="single">Examples of the Curing of a Polymer in Accordance with the Invention</u></heading><heading>Example 17</heading><p num="0083">The curing temperature of a crosslinking polymer prepared in Example 11

agent for novolac resins. It is particularly advantageous in that the polymer has very
little reactivity towards itself, yet can retain high reactivity towards novolac resins as
shown in Examples 1a-11a. The low reactivity of the polymer towards itself is shown
by the very high cure temperature of the pure crosslinking resin of Example 17,
compared to the cure of a conventional resole resin in Example 18.</p><heading><u style="single">Effect of Aldehyde and Amine Molar Ratios on Unreacted Phenol in the Polymer</u></heading><heading>Example 19</heading><p num="0086">A series of experiments was performed to determine the effect that the

agent for novolac resins. In addition, the polymer composition can be used in
combination hexamethylenetetramine and/or resoles as a cure accelerator and a
flow modifier.</p><p num="0093">Non-limiting examples of applications include: binding of recycled cellulosic
felt used in the automotive industry; binding of refractory materials; binding of fiber
materials; binding of molding compositions; binding of friction products such as brake
pads, and the binding of foundry sands and oil field propant sands. Methods of
applying and using conventional curing agents, such as hexamethylenetetramine
and resole resins, can be used in the application of the crosslinking polymer
composition of this invention. The polymer composition may be supplied in liquid or
solid form. Those skilled in the art will recognize that an effective amount of the
composition of this invention can be mixed with dry or liquid novolac resins to replace
conventional curing agents. An effective amount Is the amount of crosslinking
polymer composition of this invention required to yield the desired extent of cure.
Because of the low free phenol levels and the low formaldehyde levels associated
with the crosslinking polymer composition of this invention, processes employing the
curing agent of the present invention have greatly diminished environmental impact.
In addition, the polymer has extended shelf life when stored alone or admixed with
novolac resins.</p><p num="0094">The crosslinking polymer composition in accordance with the present
invention is particularly advantageous in: the curing of novolac resins that are used
as a binder in a thermally insulating matrix, such as glass, ceramic, wood, cotton or
synthetic fibers, where a lower novolac cure temperature is desirable; applications 
that use a novolac resin in an aqueous slurry where a curing agent such as
hexamethylenetetramine is lost through dissolution and hydrolysis; and the curing of
novolac resins where volatile emissions, such as ammonia, must be controlled.</p><heading><u style="single">Use of a Polymer in Accordance with the Invention in a Molding Composition</u></heading><p num="0095">In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the crosslinking polymer
composition of this invention when used to cure a novolac binder used in a molding
