an anti-angiogenic protein or parts thereof. More specifically, the present invention provides a gene therapy of rheumatoid arthritis
by preparing a recombinant vector that expresses a gene encoding an anti-angiogenic protein such as angiostatin or parts thereof,
and transplanting the recombinant vector or a cell that is transfected or transduced with the recombinant vector into the affected
area of a patient, and also provides the compositions for the gene therapy. The compositions for the gene therapy according to the
present invention can be used effectively for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, for which effective treating methods have not been
developed until now by providing the anti-angiogenic proteins into the knee of a patient continuously to prevent the synovial tissue
hyperplasia and the resulting inflammation.

rheumatoid arthritis including a gene encoding an anti-angiogenic protein or parts
thereof, and more particularly to a gene therapy for treating rheumatoid arthritis by
constructing a recombinant vector including a gene encoding an anti-angiogenic protein
or parts thereof and transplanting the recombinant vector or the cells transfected or
transduced with the recombinant vector into the affected area of a patient, and
compositions for the gene therapy.</p><heading><b>BACKGROUND ART</b></heading><p num="0002">Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving multiple
joints. The main pathology of the affected synovial tissue consists of the hyperplasia
and the subintimal infiltration of T and B lymphocytes. Such inflammation of the
synovial tissue is thought to be caused by T lymphocyte reactive to an unknown 
autoantigen. Nonetheless, the T lymphocyte infiltrated in the almost tissues does not
show any indication of activation on the surface of cell and also does not almost express
cytokines. In contrast to this, it is observed that both synovial tissue and fluid are
enriched with the cytokines derived from macrophage. These cytokines may include
interleukin-1 (IL-1) which can accelerate the growth of synovial fibroblast and tumor
necrosis factors (TNFs). These experimental results suggest the hypothesis that T
lymphocyte is importantly associated with the induction of inflammation to synovial
tissues and the inflammation is maintained by the cytokines derived from the activated
synovial cells.</p><p num="0003">One of the major intents of rheumatoid arthritis treatment is to prevent the
synovial tissue hyperplasia, because it forms the pannus tissue that irreversibly destroys
the cartilage and bone in the affected joint. Effective drugs for treating rheumatoid
arthritis have not been developed until the present time and the developed drugs can
exhibit limited efficacies. Once arthritis occurs, it causes economic loss as well as
severe pain.</p><p num="0004">Medical treatments of rheumatoid arthritis being used presently are as follows.
The drugs used often for initial treatment are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). These NSAIDs limitedly improve a patient's condition, but cannot prevent
the cartilage destruction of joint area or the progress of disease. Moreover, half the
patients using this treatment should stop the treatment within one year because of 
serious side effect. Next, gold drugs such as gold sodium thiomalate and gold sodium
thiosulfate, or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as
penicillamine and anti-malarials are used. These drugs also decrease the progress of
rheumatoid arthritis, but after 5 years of the treatment using DMARDs, only 5-15% of
the patients adhere to use the drugs because the serious side effect can be accompanied.
If the drugs mentioned above are not effective any more, the affected joint area with
rheumatoid arthritis should be replaced by artificial joint by surgical operation.</p><p num="0005">In this manner, most of the treatments of rheumatoid arthritis used until now
were not designed with a particular target molecule and had a limitation of showing
slight effects in most cases. In the meantime, it has been reported that therapeutic
effects appeared by taking notice of inflammation-inducing cytokines such as TNF as a
target molecule for treating the rheumatoid arthritis and introducing an antibody specific
to TNF or a soluble TNF-receptor into the affected area of a patient to result in
inactivation of the TNF (Maini, R.N. <i>et al., Immunol.</i> Rev. 144:195, 1995; Moreland,
LW. <i>et al., N.</i> Engl. J. <i>Med.</i> 337:141, 1997). In company with this, various gene
transfer experiments <i>in vivo</i> are progressing in an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis
with continuously expressing the molecules having an immune inhibitory function.
Consequently, most of the current treatments are directed to correction of the immune
aberration that supposedly drives the synovial cell proliferation. </p><p num="0006">Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is one of the earliest
histopathologic findings in rheumatoid arthritis and appears to be required for pannus
development. This neovascularization is thought not only to maintain the chronic
architectural changes via delivery of required blood-borne elements to the pannus, but
also to play an active role in inflammation as a source of both cytokine and protease
activity. The expanded vascular-bed volume resulting from angiogenesis may provide
increased access for inflammatory cells to infiltrate the synovium. Although the
factors specifically promoting angiogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis have not yet been
identified, both synovial tissue and fluid are enriched with angiogenesis-promoting
molecules. These include cytokines, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),
interleukin-8 (IL-8), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble adhesion
molecules, such as E-selectin. These data suggested a therapeutic potential for using
an anti-angiogenic procedure for favorably changing the disease course of rheumatoid
arthritis.</p><p num="0007">Until now a lot of factors that repress angiogenesis have been found. Most of
them are created from the cleavage of protoprotein, and representatively angiostatin,
endostatin and platelet factor-4 and the like have been known.</p><p num="0008">Angiostatin is composed of 98<sup>th</sup> to 440<sup>th</sup> amino acids of plasminogen.
Angiostatin was initially isolated from mice bearing a Lewis lung carcinoma and was
identified as a 38-kDa internal fragment of plasminogen that encompasses the first four 
kringles of the molecule (O'Relly, M. et <i>al., Cell</i> 79:715, 1994). It was reported that
the growth of primary tumors was inhibited effectively by injecting purified angiostatin
hypodermically in six cancer model experiments (O'Relly, M. <i>et al., Nat</i>. <i>Med.</i> 2:689,
1996).</p><p num="0009">Endostatin consists of C-terminal 183 amino acids of collagen XVIII and has an
anti-angiogenic activity. It was reported that the growth of primary tumors was
inhibited effectively by injecting purified endostatin hypodermically in four cancer
model experiments (O'Relly, M. et <i>al., Cell</i> 88:277, 1997).</p><p num="0010">Platelet factor-4 belongs to CXC cytokine family, which consists of
chemotactic polypeptides below 10 kDa, and has an anti-angiogenic activity. It was
reported that the platelet factor-4 inhibited the growth of cancer, such as B-16
melanoma and HCT-116 colon carcinoma (Maion, <i>T. E. et al., Cancer Research,</i>
51:2077,1991).</p><p num="0011">Angiogenesis is known to be associated with various diseases, such as tumor
formation and metastasis, retinitis, angioma, chronic inflammation, intestinal adhesions,
atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and so on, but it has not yet been verified that anti-angiogenic
factors were effective to all the diseases listed above actually. Only the
tumor inhibitory effects of these factors associated with a particular disease have been
reported (USP 5,856,315, USP 5,733,876, USP 5,792,845, USP 5,854,205, USP
6,024,688). The US patents disclose that the treatment effects for various kinds of 
diseases, such as ovarian carcinoma (HTB161, A2780S), colon carcinoma (MIP,
CACO2), Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC), fibrosarcoma (T241), prostate gland
carcinoma (PC-3) and breast carcinoma (MDA-MB), were identified by injecting anti-angiogenic
factors with the type of recombinant protein.</p><p num="0012">Meanwhile, unlike general treating method that applies a toxicity to cells
directly, the treating method, which cures diseases by inhibiting angiogenesis by means
of supplying anti-angiogenic factors as described above, is based on the principle of
inhibiting the cell growth, so anti-angiogenic factors over certain concentration should
be supplied continuously to exhibit effects <i>in vivo.</i> But, the method of supplying anti-angiogenic
factors with the type of recombinant proteins costs too much for
administering proteins continuously, is troublesome and has a problem in that it imparts
toxicity to a patient. Therefore, it has been required to develop a method of supplying
anti-angiogenic factors to the affected area continuously and locally.</p><p num="0013">Accordingly, the present inventors have attempted new approaches for the
probability of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by anti-angiogenesis in order to
replace the prior treatment of rheumatoid arthritis having focused on solving the
immunological problems. More particularly, the present inventors obtained the cell
lines for producing representative anti-angiogenic factors such as angiostatin, endostatin 
and platelet factor-4 through inserting their genes into a viral vector and then
transplanting them the affected area of mice induced with rheumatoid arthritis. We also
performed the histological examinations for the level of hyperplasia in synovial cell and
cartilage destruction and the immunological examinations for the concentrations of
cytokines associated with the joint inflammation, as well as macroscopic examination
for joint swelling to obtain the results for the progressive level of rheumatoid arthritis.
The results showed that the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis in our treatment was
remarkably reduced in comparison with the control group. This is to show that our gene
therapy using an anti-angiogenic gene is effective to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p><heading><b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0014">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compositions for
gene therapy of rheumatoid arthritis including a DNA encoding an anti-angiogenic
protein or parts thereof. More particularly, the present invention provides a
recombinant vector including a DNA encoding an anti-angiogenic protein or parts
thereof, a cell into which the recombinant vector is introduced and compositions for the
gene therapy of rheumatoid arthritis including the recombinant vector or the
recombinant cell as an active ingredient.</p><p num="0015">To accomplish this object, the present invention provides compositions for gene 
therapy including a DNA encoding an anti-angiogenic protein or parts thereof, which
shows therapeutic effects on rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p num="0016">According to the compositions of the present invention, the DNA encoding an
anti-angiogenic protein or parts thereof can be provided with an inserted form in
retroviral vector, adenoviral vector, adeno-associated viral vector, herpes simplex viral
vector or plasmid that can be expressed in an animal cell, or with the form of a
recombinant cell that is collected by transfecting or transducing a cell with the
recombinant vector including the DNA in order to supply anti-angiogenic factor to the
affected area continuously and locally.</p><p num="0017">Furthermore, the present invention provides a gene therapy of treating
rheumatoid arthritis by delivering the compositions to the affected area of a patient.</p><p num="0018">As used herein, the term "anti-angiogenic gene" means a DNA encoding an
anti-angiogenic protein or parts thereof. It is not limited to a natural DNA, but may
include any forms of proper modifications under maintenance of anti-angiogenic
activity and additions of elements for expression regulation if it can be used suitably for
the purpose of the present invention, regardless of whether or not it is obtained by
genetic engineering method or chemical method.</p><p num="0019">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.</p><p num="0020">The present invention is characterized in that the composition for gene therapy 
of treating arthritis comprises a DNA encoding anti-angiogenic protein or parts thereof
as an active ingredient. The anti-angiogenic gene used in the gene therapy for treating
arthritis according to the present invention is preferably a gene encoding at least one
protein selected from the group consisting of angiostatin, endostatin, platelet factor-4,
thrombospondin-1; thrombospondin-2, METH-1, METH-2 (anti-angiogenic proteins
having metalloprotease domain and thrombospondin domain; Vanzquez <i>F. et al., J. Biol.
Chem.</i> 274(33):23349-57, 1999) and hepatocyte growth factor.</p><p num="0021">Particularly, the anti-angiogenic gene included in the composition for gene
therapy of treating arthritis according to the invention is preferably. the gene encoding
the angiostatin including 98<sup>th</sup> to 440<sup>th</sup> amino acids of human plasminogen and the four
kringles, the gene encoding the endostatin including 1334<sup>th</sup> to 1516<sup>th</sup> amino acids of
human collagen XVIII, or the gene encoding the mouse platelet factor-4 protein.</p><p num="0022">Although an entire amino acid sequence may be used as the anti-angiogenic
factor, a fragment known as having anti-angiogenic activity may also be used. For
example, angiostatin kringle 1-3 fragment may be used for this purpose.</p><p num="0023">The example of the anti-angiogenic gene included in the composition for gene
therapy of treating arthritis according to the invention may preferably be the DNA
derived from human, mouse, rhesus, pig or bovine plasminogen, and more preferably
the cDNA of human angiostatin. The endostatin gene may also preferably be the DNA
derived from human, mouse, rhesus, pig or bovine collagen XVIII, and more preferably 
the cDNA of human endostatin. The preferable embodiments of the invention identified
that the angiostatin and endostatin genes cloned from human foreskin fibroblast (HFF)
are effective to gene therapy for treating arthritis.</p><p num="0024">The recombinant vector included in the composition for gene therapy for
treating arthritis according to the invention also comprises the anti-angiogenic gene. It is
preferable that the recombinant vector further comprises a nucleotide sequence
encoding a signal peptide required for secretion in the upstream or downstream in order
to secrete the protein expressed by the gene out of the cell.</p><p num="0025">The signal peptide may include any signal peptides known as associated to
protein secretion in eukaryotic cell, and may preferably be 18 of amino-terminal amino
acids of human plasminogen represented as the SEQ ID No. 2 or the signal peptide of
mouse immunoglobulin Îº chain encoded by the nucleotide sequence represented as
SEQ ID No. 13.</p><p num="0026">For example, as described below in one preferable example according to the
invention, the signal sequence can be functionally connected to the anti-angiogenic gene
by synthesizing a nucleotide including the nucleotide sequence encoding 18 of the
amino-terminal amino acids of human plasminogen and the sequences having restrictive
enzyme cleaving sites, hybridizing it into double helical DNA, and treating it with
restrictive enzyme to insert it into a certain site of target vector. However, the
construction of vector having a signal sequence for producing the secretion type of anti-angiogenic 
protein is not limited to as mentioned above, but may be accomplished by
the method well known in the field of this art.</p><p num="0027">The vector used in the composition for gene therapy of treating arthritis
according to the invention is a vector in which the anti-angiogenic gene can be inserted
to supply the anti-angiogenic factor continuously to the affected area. The vector may
include virus-derived vectors such as retroviral vector, adenoviral vector, adeno-associated
viral vector, and herpes simplex viral vector, plasmids capable of being
expressed in bodies of animals such as pCXN2 (Gene, 108:193-200, 1991) and
PAGE207 (Japan Patent Laid-Open No. Sho6-4684), and their modified vectors.</p><p num="0028">In the preferable example according to the present invention, a viral vector was
prepared, which was to produce angiostatin, endostatin or platelet factor-4 as a anti-angiogenic
factor, using MT5 retroviral vector which had been filed before Korean
Industrial Property Office (KIPO) by the present inventors (Korean Patent Appl. No.
97-48095; KCCM-10205), and the effect for treating arthritis was verified by
experimental results as to mouse using the viral vector. The MT5 retroviral vector is a
vector based on murine leukemia virus (MLV) including mutant noncoding sequence of
human elongation factor 1 (EF 1), without coding sequence derived from virus and is
good in both external gene expressing efficiency and viral titer. That is to say, the vector
is to enhance stability by completely removing the <i>gag, pol</i> and <i>env</i> sequence of MLV,
is to include at the upstream of external gene insertion site, a part of noncoding 
sequence of EF 1a as a noncoding sequence derived from heterogeneous gene for
providing splicing receptor, and is to control splicing efficiency appropriately to
maintain gene expressing highly with also maintaining virus producing concentration
highly.</p><p num="0029">Particularly, in one example of the present invention, angiostatin DNA
fragment encoding 93<sup>rd</sup> to 368<sup>th</sup> amino acids of human plasminogen represented as SEQ
ID No. 2 was obtained from human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) through PCR and was
inserted into pGEM T easy vector to construct pGEM T easy-hASTi vector. The
sequence encoding 18 of amino-terminal amino acids of plasminogen of SEQ ID No. 2
was synthesized as a signal sequence, and was inserted into pGEM T easy-hASTi vector
to construct pGEM T easy-hAST vector. The obtained vector was cleaved with BamHI
to prepare human angiostatin gene fragment connected with the signal sequence, which
was inserted into MTS vector. In the meantime, to prepare cell lines expressing human
angiostatin, MT5-hAST vector DNA was transfected into 293T cell with the plasmid
expressing <i>gag-pol</i> and env gene of murine leukemia virus and then non-cellular virus
was obtained from the cell culture media.</p><p num="0030">The obtained virus was transduced into NIH3T3, and then the cell lines
introduced with retrovirus were selected and cultivated to prepare NIH3T3 cells
expressing human angiostatin protein. By means of the same method, NIH3T3 cells
expressing human endostatin protein and mouse platelet factor-4 protein were prepared 
respectively.</p><p num="0031">Another example of the present invention verified the effect of gene therapy for
arthritis using the cell lines respectively expressing anti-angiogenic proteins such as
human angiostatin protein, human endostatin protein and mouse platelet factor-4 protein.</p><p num="0032">Particularly, a gene therapy to mice without any macroscopic signs of
inflammation in collagen-induced arthritis mouse model was performed. Namely, anti-angiogenic
protein-producing NIH3T3 cell lines mixed with PBS were transplanted in
the knee joint area of rear leg of the arthritis-mouse, and then the progressive level of
arthritis was investigated by measuring joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia, destruction
of cartilage, and joint inflammation-associated cytokine level.</p><p num="0033">The results showed that the swelling level in the knee joint area in case of
transplanting angiostatin-producing NIH3T3 cell lines was remarkably decreased to
27% in comparison that the control group in case of injecting only PBS or transplanting
the cell lines transferred with only MT5 vector was 47% or 67%. The frequency
showing the significant level of IL-1 was also remarkably decreased. The synovial
hyperplasia and cartilage destruction in the knee joint area were also remarkably
decreased. Furthermore, similar results to the transplant of antiostatin producing
NIH3T3 cell lines were obtained when endostatin producing NIH3T3 cell lines and
platelet factor-4 producing NIH3T3 cell lines were transplanted. These results show that
the gene therapy using anti-angiogenic gene according to the present invention is 
effective to suppression and treatment of arthritis.</p><p num="0034">In another example of the present invention, duration of therapeutic effects was
measured. The result showed that therapeutic effect of a single injection lasts for 14
days after treatment.</p><p num="0035">The composition of gene therapy for treating arthritis according to the present
invention can be prepared by preparing viral particles including recombinant DNA
encoding anti-angiogenic protein or cell lines transduced with the viral particles and
mixing them with carriers used in gene therapy (Crystal RG <i>et al., Nature Genet.</i>
8:42-51, 1994).</p><p num="0036">The carriers used in gene therapy may include any carriers generally used in
injection liquid. For example, the carriers may include distilled water, sodium chloride
solutions, the mixtures of sodium chloride and inorganic salts or their similar mixtures,
the solutions of materials such as mannitol, lactose, dextran, and glucose, amino acid
solutions such as glycine and arginine, the mixtures of organic acid solutions or salt
solutions and glucose solutions, and their similar solutions. The injection liquid may be
prepared in the form of solution, suspension or colloidal solution by adding osmotic
modulator, pH controller, vegetable oil such as sesame oil or bean oil, lecithin or
surfactant such as non-ionic surfactant to the carriers in the conventional manners. This
injection may be prepared in the form of powder or lyophilization and then dissolved in
the form of solution before being used. </p><p num="0037">The composition of gene therapy for treating arthritis according to the present
invention may be dissolved in a sterilized carrier, in case of solid phase, if needed,
before treatment of gene therapy, or may be used as it is without further treatment in
case of liquid phase.</p><p num="0038">The composition of gene therapy for treating arthritis according to the present
invention can be absorbed in the synovial cell of blood vessel of target area through the
injection manner that the total daily dose of effective ingredient locally administered to
a patient may range from 1 ng to 1 g or it may be administered once through catheter
after surgical operation.</p><p num="0039">The cell line including anti-angiogenic factor producing vector may be any cell
which has the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen identical or similar to
patient's such that it does not generate histoincompatibility during transplantation. That
the synovial cell of patient's are separated and used for gene transfer is preferable for
excluding histoincompatibility completely.</p><heading><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p num="0040"><sl><li>Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram that shows the process of preparing the pGEM T-hASTi

foreskin fibroblast (HFF), obtaining cDNA, and performing PCR. First, RNA was
extracted from the HFF cells by using the Tryzol method (Gibco BRL, USA), and
cDNA was obtained from the extracted RNA by using reverse transcriptase
polymerization reaction. Then, a DNA fragment including human angiostatin gene
was obtained through the PCR by using the cDNA as a PCR template and the synthetic
nucleotides represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 3 and SEQ. ID. NO: 4 as primers. To
perform the PCR, total 100 Âµl of a mixture solution was prepared by mixing 1 Âµl of
template DNA, each of 1 Âµl of 10 pmol/Âµl primer, 10 Âµl of 10 mM dNTP, 35 units of
Expand high fidelity enzyme (Gibco BRL, USA) and 10 Âµl of buffer for enzymes. The
reaction condition for PCR was as follows: 94Â°C for 1 min, 50Â°C for 1 min, 72 Â°C for 1
min 30 sec. The PCR was performed 30 cycles. The amplified angiostatin gene
includes a DNA encoding 93<sup>rd</sup>~368<sup>th</sup> amino acids of human plasminogen represented
by SEQ. ID. NO: 2. The amplified PCR product of about 800 bp was introduced into a

prepare a nucleotide sequence encoding N-terminal 18 amino acids of human
plasminogen as a signal peptide, nucleotides represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 5 and SEQ.

the double stranded synthetic nucleotides have <i>Hind</i>III and <i>Bam</i>HI sites in one end, and
<i>Nhe</i>l site in the other end. The nucleotides were introduced into <i>Hind</i>III and Nhel sites
of the pGEM T easy-hASTi vector to construct a pGEM T easy-hAST vector. And
then, the pGEM T easy-hAST vector was digested with <i>Bam</i>HI to obtain human

arthritis model which shows many characteristics in common with human rheumatoid
arthritis. The collagen-induced arthritis model was prepared by the following method.
DBA/1 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Maine, USA), aged 9-10 weeks at the start of
experiments, were immunized intradermally at the base of the tail with bovine type II
collagen (100 Âµg; Chondrex, WA, USA) emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant
(Gibco BRL, NY, USA). On day 21, the animals were boosted with an intradermal 
injection of 100 Âµg type II collagen. Gradual onset of arthritis normally starts
approximately 4 weeks after initial immunization. In this example, mice that did not yet
have any macroscopic signs of arthritis were chosen at 30 days after the initial
immunization to perform gene therapy.</p><heading>(3-2) Measurement of arthritis progress level</heading><p num="0053">Measurement and detailed decision on indices for measuring arthritis progress
level were performed by the following manner. First, histological analysis was
performed for the knee joint cavity in which the cell lines expressing anti-angiogenic
protein (human angiostatin, human endostatin, and mouse platelet factor-4) were
transplanted. The main phathology of rheumatoid arthritis may be summarized to
consist of the hyperplasia of joint synovial cells and irreversible destruction of cartilage
tissues due to the hyperplasia. Histological analysis is the most effective to decide the
progress level of the synovial cell hyperplasia and cartilage destruction. For this
analysis, knee joints of mice were dissected, fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin,
decalcified in 10% EDTA, and then embedded in paraffin. Standard frontal sections of 7
Âµm were prepared and stained with either hematoxylin/eosin or Safranin O/fast green
(Bakker A.C. et <i>al., Arthritis and Rheumatism</i> 40:893-900, 1997; Apparailly Florence et

inflammation and faint synovial hyperplasia, and 2 in the formation of pannus and
synovial hyperplasia heavier than severe level. It was decided that arthritis occurred in
the knee if the hyperplasia level of synovial cell was 2 or more.</p><p num="0055">The levels of cartilage destructions were scored based on the results of Safranin

amount of inflammation-associated cytokine. The levels of joint swellings were scored 
based on the results of macroscopic signs according to the criterion suggested in the
published paper (Apparailly Florence et <i>al., J. Iminunol.</i> 160:5213-5220, 1998). The
scores are 0 in normal condition, 1 in swelling and slight erythema, 2 in distint swelling
and erythema, and 3 in severe edema accompanied with wound. It was decided that
arthritis occurred in the ankle if the level of joint swelling was 2 or more. It was also
decided to be a serious case of arthritis if the level was 3 or more. The detection of
inflammation-associated cytokine was performed by measuring the expression amount
of mouse interleukine-1 (IL-1), which was known to play an important role during the
progress of arthritis, in the ankle joint with ELISA. (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, USA)
according to the instruction of manufacturer. It was decided that arthritis occurred if the
expression amount of interleukine-1 was 10 ng or more per 1g of proteins in the joint
