No. 60/077,673, filed Mar. 12, 1998.</p><?description-type Brief Summary?><heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention pertains to foamable silicone oil compositions and methods of use thereof. The compositions, on foamed release thereof from aerosol canisters or the like, present stable foamed products capable of use as lubricants.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>It is known to use silicone oils as penetrating lubricants and moisture repellants for metal and plastic surfaces. For example, silicone oil-based aerosol spray products have been used for lubricating bearings and hinges to which liquid oils or greases cannot be easily applied. Petroleum-based oils, such as those available from the WD-40 Company of San Diego, Calif., have a number of disadvantages when compared to silicone-based lubricants, including disagreeable odors which can limit the indoor use of petroleum-based oils.</p><p>One drawback to the use of silicone oils is that such oils tend to run or drip when applied to surfaces, possibly contaminating neighboring surfaces. For example, silicone oil sprayed onto the brake calipers of a motor vehicle has been known to drip onto the rotors or pads, thereby reducing the friction of the brake.</p><p>Therefore, it is one object of the invention to provide a silicone oil-based foamable lubricant capable of forming a stable foam when extruded through the valve of an aerosol canister or other spray container.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>These and other objects are met by the silicone oil-based foamable compositions and methods of use of the instant invention. Compositions in accordance with the invention may be sprayed onto surfaces to form stable foams which do not run or drip, preferably for periods in excess of sixteen hours. These foams, having viscosities preferably no greater than about 10.sup.4 centipoise (cP), retain the lubricity characteristics of silicone oils to provide lubricants capable of precise localized application.</p><p>A composition in accordance with the invention comprises an aqueous emulsion of a silicone oil. Oil-in-water emulsions of polysiloxanes, such as polydimethylsiloxane, having melting points no greater than about 32</p><p>The composition further comprises a liquefiable gaseous propellant, preferably including a volatile liquid hydrocarbon or a mixture of volatile liquid hydrocarbons.</p><p>The composition further comprises a solid, non-ionic lipophilic surfactant, preferably having an HLB value of about 3 to about 8, more preferably about 3.5 to about 6. These surfactants are water insoluble. Useful surfactants include fatty acid (i.e., C.sub.12 and greater) esters fatty alcohol ethers and fatty acid amides. At present, the most preferred surfactants comprise one or more ethoxylated fatty alcohols.</p><p>The high temperature stability of the composition may be improved by adding a high temperature foam stabilizer having a melting point greater than about 110 polar, linear saturated long chain fatty alcohols having twenty or more carbon atoms in the molecule. At present, behenyl alcohol is most preferred.</p><p>In addition to the above components, the foamable compositions may also comprise a dispersant/solvent such as isopropanol (IPA) to aid in dispersing or dissolving the surfactant and the high temperature foam stabilizer. IPA also aids in foam drying and acts as a heat sink when the solid surfactant is melted and mixed during preparation of the foamable compositions.</p><p>Typically, the surfactants and the high temperature foam stabilizer are melted and mixed with the dispersant/solvent. According to one form of the invention, a solid cationic water repellant is melted and mixed with the surfactants and the foam stabilizer. Then this mixture is combined with the silicone oil emulsion. Any desired additives, which may include, without limitation, rust inhibitors and anti-microbial agents, are blended into the combination. The resulting material is loaded into the desired container and charged with the propellant. The resulting composition is discharged under pressure through a valve of the container to form a lubricating foam.</p><p>Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory of operation it is thought that the surfactant coats the volatile liquid hydrocarbon propellant as the foamable composition is expelled from the pressurized container. The surfactant on foam dispensing, changes from the liquid phase into the solid phase where it is positioned along the water/organic interface. At that location, the surfactant functions as a foam builder, supporting the bubbles formed by the volatile hydrocarbon and the surrounding silicone oil. On evaporation of the propellant and water from the emulsion, the polymer bubbles are stabilized by the waxy surfactant and oil.</p><p>The present invention provides foamable lubricating compositions which do not run or drip when sprayed onto surfaces from aerosol containers. Such compositions may be applied to specific locations with minimal risk that the compositions will contaminate neighboring surfaces.</p><p>The invention will be further described in conjunction with the appended drawings and detailed description.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>The sole FIGURE is a schematic view showing use of the foamable compositions of the invention as a spray lubricant applied to a hinge.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading><p>The compositions of the invention are contained, before foaming, in aerosol canisters or other spray containers that, after loading with the compositions, are pressurized to expel foamed beads or rope-like strands of material from the containers. Such containers are well known in the art and need not be explained herein. Suffice it here to state that such containers are operatively associated with sufficient valve means so as to selectively open the containers thereby allowing expulsion of the pressurized components housed therein and to close the containers after the desired foamed application. One aerosol container that may be adapted for use in providing a foamed lubricant product in accordance with the invention is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,705,669 (Cox).</p><p>The compositions of the invention comprise aqueous emulsions of silicone oil. Silicone oils are known to be water repellant but arc dispersable in water under certain conditions, such as in the presence of suitable emulsifiers. Preferred compositions comprise oil-in-water emulsions of polysiloxanes, such as polydimethylsiloxane, having melting points no greater than about 32 emulsion is available under the trademark LE-458 HS from OSi Specialties, Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.</p><p>In addition to the polydimethylsiloxane silicone oils, other silicone oils such as phenylmethyl silicone oil, amino-modified silicone oil, epoxy-modified silicone oil and fatty acid silicone oils can be mentioned.</p><p>The propellant constituents can be chosen from a wide variety of known propellants such as the C.sub.1 -C.sub.6 alkanes and C.sub.1 -C.sub.6 alkenes. In this regard, volatile liquid hydrocarbons such as propane, n-butane, isobutane, hexane, n-pentane, 2-methylbutane, 1-pentene, butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, cyclobutane. cyclopentane and cyclohexane can be employed. Less desirably, halogenated hydrocarbons such as vinyl chloride; methyl chloride; methyl bromide; dichlorodifluoromethane; 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane; 1,1-difluoroethane; and the like may be employed although some of these are not favored due to environmental concerns. A detailed listing of liquid propellants may be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,066 (Page et al.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>The preferred surfactants include non-ionic solid, waxy lipophilic compounds having HLB values of about 3 to about 8, more preferably about 3.5 to about 6. These surfactants are water insoluble and are chosen from the group of fatty (i.e. C.sub.12 or greater) acid esters, fatty alcohol ethers and fatty acid amides. As to the fatty alcohol ethers, these include alkoxylated (preferably Et--O--) fatty alcohols such as ethoxylated (2) cetyl alcohol, ethoxylated (2) stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Especially preferred surfactants include those available under the trademarks Brij 52 and Brij 72 from ICI Americas Inc. of Wilmington, Del. and under the trademark Procol CA-2/SA-2 from Protameen Chemicals, Inc. of Totowa, N.J.</p><p>Preferably, a high temperature foam stabilizer having a melting point of about 110 stability of the foam at temperatures above the melting points of the constituents of the surfactant. Most preferably, the foam stabilizer comprises a polar, linear saturated long chain fatty alcohol having more than about twenty carbon atoms in the molecule., such as behenyl alcohol. Behenyl alcohol, which has a melting point of 159.8.degree. F. (71 C.). is available commercially from Protomeen Chemicals, Inc. of Totowa, N.J. and, in a less purified form, under the trademark 1822A from Henkel Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio. Their commercially available products are mixtures of long chain fatty alcohols as described above wherein the majority of the molecules in the mixture have greater than twenty carbon atoms.</p><p>In addition to the above components, the foamable compositions may also comprise a dispersant/solvent such as isopropanol (IPA) to aid in dispersing the surfactant. IPA also aids in foam drying and acts as a heat sink when the solid surfactant is melted and mixed during preparation of the foamable compositions.</p><p>In addition, water repellant compounds can be included in the compositions as needed. In this regard, a host of such compounds are commercially available and may be used. At present, the cationic amines such as the quaternary ammonium salts are preferred. One such product is available under the trademark Mackernium SDC-85 from McIntyre Group Ltd., University Park, Ill. This product is a stearalkonium chloride available in flake form.</p><p>If ferrous metal containers are used to house the foamable compositions, it may be desirable to add minor amounts of rust inhibitor components to the composition. Rust inhibitors are available from many commercial suppliers. An exemplary rust inhibitor is available from Raybo Chemical Co. of Huntington, W. Va. under the trademark Raybo 60 No Rust.</p><p>Anti-microbial agents such as fungicides, algaecides, mildewicides and the like may also be added to the composition. One such fungicide is sold under the trademark Polyphase AF1 and is available from Troy Corporation of East Hanover, N.J.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________Exemplary compositions may include the following components:______________________________________a)   silicone oil o/w               ≧85                         (wt % based on weight ofemulsion                 foamable composition                         prior to charge of                         propellant)b)   surfactants     1-10     (wt % based on weight of                         foamable composition                         prior to charge of                         propellant)c)   high temperature               0.25-10   (wt % based on weight offoam stabilizer          foamable composition                         prior to charge of                         propellant)d)   dispersant/solvent                1-10     (wt % based on weight of                         foamable composition                         prior to charge of                         propellant)e)   water repellant               0-5       (wt % based on weight of                         foamable composition                         prior to charge of                         propellant)f)   rust inhibitor 0-5       (wt % based on weight of                         foamable composition                         prior to charge of                         propellant)g)   anti-microbial agent               0-5       (wt % based on weight ofa)-g) add up to 100 wt % foamable composition                         prior to charge of                         propellant)propellant      2-10     (wt % based on weight of                         the composition                         including propellant)______________________________________</pre></p><p>Typically, the surfactants, the high temperature foam stabilizer and, if desired, the water repellant are melted and mixed with the dispersant/solvent.

The height of the bead was measured at periodic intervals, with the following results:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________TIME AFTER EXTRUSION             BEAD HEIGHT______________________________________0 min.            23 mm11 min.           20 mm13 min.           20 mm16 min.           20 mm18 min.           20 mm16 hr., 28 min.   20 mm______________________________________</pre></p><p>These results show that the composition of Example 2 produced a stable lubricant foam bead which retained over 86% of its original bead height even after more than about sixteen hours.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading><p>A foamable composition was prepared having the following components:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________A foamable composition was prepared having the followingcomponents:______________________________________silicone oil o/w emulsion               89.2       wt %ethoxylated fatty alcohol surfactant               1.7        wt %IPA                 4.         wt %synthetic fibers    1.         wt %ethylene glycol     2.         wt %water repellant     0.7        wt %rust inhibitor      1.25       wt %anti-microbial agent               0.2        wt %______________________________________</pre></p><p>The silicone oil o/w emulsion was available from OSi Specialties, Inc. of Greenwich, Conn. under the trademark LE-458 HS. The surfactant was a mixture of approximately 60 wt % ethoxylated (2) cetyl alcohol to approximately 40 wt % ethoxylated (2) stearyl alcohol available under the trademark Procol CA2/SA2 from Protameen Chemicals, Inc. of Totowa, N.J.</p><p>The synthetic fibers were available under the trademark Pulplus TA-12 and were added in an effort to increase the cohesion of the foam. It was observed that compositions having greater than about 1 wt % fibers tended to clog the valve of the aerosol container.</p><p>The water repellant was a flaked stearalkonium chloride cationic repellant available under the trademark Mackemium SDC-85 from McIntyre Group Ltd., University Park, Ill. The rust inhibitor was available under the trademark Raybo 60 No Rust from Raybo Chemical Co. of Huntington, W. Va. The anti-microbial agent was a fungicide available under the trademark Polyphase AF1 from Troy Corporation of East Hanover, N.J.</p><p>The surfactant, the high temperature foam stabilizer and the water repellant were melted and mixed with the isopropanol. The mixture was then combined with the silicone oil emulsion. The rust inhibitor and the anti-microbial agent were blended into the mixture. A quantity of the resulting mixture was loaded into an aerosol container and charged with a hydrocarbon propellant.</p><p>The composition of Example 3 had a measured dynamic viscosity of 4,567 cP, well below the maximum of 10.sup.4 cP.</p><p>The stability of foams produced from the composition of Example 3 was tested by extruding the composition through the valve of the container to form a bead of the material on a flat, impermeable surface. The foam did not dry even after eighteen hours. The bead, which had an initial height of 17 mm, maintained a height of 15 mm, that is, over 88% of its original height, after 18 to 24 hours.</p><p>The tendency of the foam to run was tested by extruding a 2 cm bead of the material onto a rectangle of the same size drawn on a vertically suspended piece of paper. The "slump" of the bead was measured as the distance which the bead migrated under the force of gravity from the bottom perimeter of the rectangle after a dry time of 16 to 24 hours. The slump of foams produced by the composition of Example 3 was measured to be 49 mm. These results showed that the foams produced by the composition of Example 3 had a strong resistance to running.</p><p>The foamable compositions in accordance with the invention can be used as penetrating lubricants and water repellants for metal and plastic parts in the same manner as commercially-available silicone oil sprays. For example, in the FIGURE, the foamed composition 10 is applied to lubricate a hinge 12 by spraying or extruding the composition from an aerosol canister or spray can 14. The foamed composition 10 forms beads on the surface of the hinge 12 which resist running or dripping. A portion of the foamed composition 10 penetrates between hinge members 20, 22 to lubricate the interior of the hinge 12.</p><p>Accordingly, in its broadest contexts, the invention pertains to lubricating compositions comprising aqueous emulsions including silicone oil and solid, non-ionic lipophilic surfactants capable of forming stable foams when sprayed from aerosol canisters or other spray containers. Preferably, high temperature foam stabilizers having melting points greater than approximately 110 the compositions to improve the stability of the foam at high temperatures. The foamed lubricants do not run or drip when applied to a specific locations on surfaces, thereby minimizing the risk of contaminating neighboring surfaces.</p><p>An effective amount of the foamable lubricating composition is applied, via foaming, onto the desired surface to provide lubrication thereto. In accordance with the invention, a stable foam is thereby supplied to the surface. The foam is a durable foam that will not substantially collapse and, as set forth above a foam bead or the like will retain at least about 2/3 of its applied height about 16 hours after application. Therefore, the foamed lubricant will stay in place for protracted periods and effectively provide lubricating action to the desired machine part etc.</p><p>While this invention has been described with respect to particular embodiments thereof, it is apparent that numerous other forms and modifications of this invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art. The appended claims and this invention generally should be construed to cover all such obvious forms and modifications which are within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What is claimed is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
