The characteristics of the curing agents are a significant factor in determining various properties of a rubber composition with which the curatives are compounded. Conventionally tire tread rubber compositions for example use sulfur, accelerators such as sulfenamides, stearic acid, and zinc oxide to impart the desired cure and performance characteristics. Performance characteristics may include, for example, traction and rolling resistance, among others. Additionally, other additives may be included in the rubber composition as processing aids, antidegradants, reinforcing fillers, coupling agents, and the like.</p><heading><u style="single">Disclosure of the invention</u></heading><p num="p0002">The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire according to claim 1.

The material obtained in this step is typically a fine powder and cannot be used for most practical applications, e.g., in catalysis, where shaped bodies are required.</p><p num="p0023">As disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="US20040225134A" status="new"><text>US-A- 2004/0225134</text></patcit>, certain metal organic framework materials and isorecticular metal organic framework materials may be exploited to bind so-called guest molecules within the pores of the MOF or IR-MOF. It is now disclosed that certain chemical species may be incorporated into the pores of zinc organic framework materials or isoreticular zinc organic framework materials, such chemical species may include additives typically utilized in rubber compounds for use in tires.</p><p num="p0024">In one embodiment, the zinc organic framework material useful to hose guest additives is an MOF-5 type material. In another embodiment, the zinc organic framework material is an MOF-177 type material as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="US20040225134A" status="new"><text>US-A-2004/0225134</text></patcit>. In another embodiment, the zinc organic framework material is an isoreticular MOF (IR-MOF) as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="US6930193B" status="new"><text>US-B- 6,930,193</text></patcit>. As disclosed<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> therein, MOF-177 is a crystalline Zn<sub>4</sub>O(BTB)<sub>2</sub> (BTB=1,3,5-benzenetribenzoate). A suitable IR-MOF is one having a pore size sufficient to host a given rubber additive, according to the unit size of the additive, such as a molecule, atom, nanoparticle, etc.</p><p num="p0025">In one embodiment, rubber compounding additives that may serve as guest molecules or atoms in MOF or IR-MOF materials may include plasticizers, antidegradants, silane coupling agents, sulfur, vulcanization accelerators, colorants, functionalized oligomers, and the like. The use of MOF or IR-MOF materials as a carrier for such rubber compounding additives may assist in one or more functions during the processing, cure, and use of a rubber compound or tire. Such functions may include but are not limited to assisting in dispersion of the additive during rubber mixing, and controlled release of a rubber additive during rubber mixing, cure, or during use in a tire. In the case of use to aid in dispersion of an additive, the MOF or IR-MOF containing the guest additive may act to carry difficult-to-disperse additives during rubber mixing such that the additive is more uniformly dispersed in the rubber. After mixing, the MOF or IR-MOF may break down due to dissolution or reaction with the rubber or other additives. In the case of use to act as a controlled release carrier, the MOF or IR-MOF containing the guest additive may retain a particular guest additive after mixing in the rubber until such time as it is desirable to expose the additive to the rubber compound environment. The release may be effected by dissolution or reaction of the MOF or IR-MOF.</p><p num="p0026">As disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="US20040225134A" status="new"><text>US-A- 2004/0225134</text></patcit>, the ability of a given MOF or IR-MOF to host a guest additives may be dependent on both the pore size in the MOF or IR-MOF, and the size of the intended guest additive. In the case of the dye molecules and as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="US20040225134A" status="new"><text>US-A- 2004/0225134</text></patcit>, the ability of MOF-177 crystals to host large organic guest molecules was therein quantified for the dyes Astrazon Orange, Nile Red, and Reichardt's dye. These incorporated 16, 2 and 1 molecules per unit cell respectively. Slicing the crystals to expose their inner core indicated that for Astrazon Orange and Nile Red, distribution of the guest molecules was observed throughout the crystal while for Reichardt's dye, the presence was primarily restricted to the crystal edges. It is herein contemplated that organic molecules such as those used as additives in rubber compounding may also serve as guest molecules in a zinc organic framework material. The degree of incorporation of a given additive into a zinc organic framework material may depend on the relative size of the additive as compared with the pore size of the given zinc organic framework material.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Thus, while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that in hosting guest additive species in a zinc organic framework material, the guest species may be wholly or at least partially incorporated into the pores of the zinc organic framework material. By incorporation, it is meant that the guest additive species may be absorbed to or otherwise associated with the zinc organic framework material such that upon mixing of the zinc organic framework material containing the guest additive species into a rubber compound, the guest additive is dispersed with the zinc organic framework material into the rubber compound. After such mixing, the guest additive may be subsequently at least partially disassociated from the zinc organic framework material, by diffusion, dissolution, chemical reaction, or the like.</p><p num="p0027">For example, in the case of antidegradants, any of the known antioxidants and antiozonants as are known in the rubber compounding art may be included as guest species in the MOF or IR-MOF. Such antidegradants may include but are not limited to p-phenylene diamines, dihydroquinolines, hindered phenols, and the like. It may be desirable, for example, to obtain controlled release of the antidegradants over time to replenish consumed antidegradants in the rubber compound.</p><p num="p0028">In the case of silane coupling agents, such as sulfur containing organosilicon compounds as are described more fully herein, certain of these materials are highly reactive with the rubber owing to their sulfur content, and may react before being fully dispersed during rubber mixing. It may be desirable to include such sulfur containing organosilicon compounds as guest molecules in an MOF or IR-MOF to better disperse the sulfur containing organosilicon compounds in the rubber and avoid undesirable increase in mixing viscosity.</p><p num="p0029">In the case of vulcanization accelerators, certain accelerators are known to be highly reactive and their use in some rubber compounding applications may lead to scorching of the rubber compound. It may be desirable to include such accelerators as guest molecules in an MOF or IR-MOF to retain the accelerator in an unreactive form as a guest molecule, with subsequent release into the rubber compound upon dissolution or reaction of the MOF or IR-MOF. Upon release, the accelerator would then be available for utilization in the curing reaction of the rubber.</p><p num="p0030">In one embodiment, inclusion of the guest additive into the zinc organic framework material may be accomplished via diffusion of the additive from a solution containing the additive and the zinc organic framework material. Thus,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> for example, the additive may be incorporated into the zinc organic framework material as is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="US20040225134A" status="new"><text>US-A- 2004/0225134</text></patcit>, wherein it is disclosed that organic dye molecules are incorporated into MOF-177 via uptake of the dye into the MOF-177 by exposing the MOF-177 crystals to a saturated dye solution in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p num="p0031">In one embodiment, 0.1 to 50 phr of zinc organic framework material is present in the rubber component of the tire.

Some or all of the zinc organic framework material may include guest additives as described herein, following the general description herein as to the appropriate amount of the given additive in the rubber compound.</p><p num="p0032">In addition to the zinc organic framework material, the rubber component contains at least one rubber containing olefinic unsaturation. The phrases "rubber or elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation" or "diene based rubbers" are intended to include both natural rubber and its various raw and reclaim forms as well as various synthetic rubbers. In the description of this invention, the terms "rubber" and "elastomer" may be used interchangeably, unless otherwise prescribed. The terms "rubber composition," "compounded rubber" and "rubber compound" are used interchangeably to refer to rubber which has been blended or mixed with various ingredients and materials and such terms are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing or rubber compounding art. Representative synthetic polymers are the homopolymerization products of butadiene and its homologues and derivatives, for example, methylbutadiene, dimethylbutadiene and pentadiene as well as copolymers such as those formed from butadiene or its homologues or derivatives with other unsaturated monomers. Among the latter are acetylenes, for example, vinyl acetylene; olefins, for example, isobutylene, which copolymerizes with isoprene to form butyl rubber; vinyl compounds, for example, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile (which polymerize with butadiene to form NBR), methacrylic acid and styrene, the latter compound polymerizing with butadiene to form SBR, as well as vinyl esters and various unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and ethers, e.g., acrolein, methyl isopropenyl ketone and vinylethyl ether. Specific examples of synthetic rubbers include neoprene (polychloroprene), polybutadiene (including cis-1,4-polybutadiene), polyisoprene (including cis-1,4-polyisoprene), butyl rubber, halobutyl rubber such as chlorobutyl rubber or bromobutyl rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, copolymers of 1,3-butadiene or isoprene with monomers such as<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> styrene, acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate, as well as ethylene/propylene terpolymers, also known as ethylene/propylene/diene monomer (EPDM), and in particular, ethylene/propylene/ dicyclopentadiene terpolymers.

The preferred rubber or elastomers are natural rubber, synthetic polyisoprene, polybutadiene and SBR.</p><p num="p0033">In one aspect the rubber is preferably of at least two of diene based rubbers. For example, a combination of two or more rubbers is preferred such as cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural or synthetic, although natural is preferred), 3,4-polyisoprene rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, emulsion and solution polymerization derived styrene/butadiene rubbers, cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubbers and emulsion polymerization prepared butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers.</p><p num="p0034">In one aspect of this invention, an emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (E-SBR) might be used having a relatively conventional styrene content of 20 to 28 percent bound styrene or, for some applications, an E-SBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content, namely, a bound styrene content of 30 to 45 percent.</p><p num="p0035">The relatively high styrene content of 30 to 45 for the E-SBR can be considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing traction, or skid resistance, of the tire tread.
