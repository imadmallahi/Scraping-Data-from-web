Serotonin is thought to play a role in processes related to learning and memory, sleep, thermoregulation, mood, motor activity, pain, sexual and aggressive behaviors, appetite, neurodegenerative regulation, and biological rhythms. As expected, serotonin is linked to pathophysiological conditions such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, autism, migraine, emesis, alcoholism and neurodegenerative disorders. The serotonin receptors are currently classified into seven subfamilies</p><p num="p0004">(5-HTi through 5-HT<sub>7</sub>). See, Hoyer, D., et al., "VII International Union of Pharmacology classification of receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine", Pharmacol. Rev., 56, 157-203 (1994). The subfamilies have been further divided into subtypes. For example, the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor is currently divided into three subtypes: 5-HT<sub>2a</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2c</sub>. The three subtypes of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors are linked to phospholipase C with the generation of two second messengers, diacylglycerol (which activates protein kinase C) and inositol trisphosphate (which releases intracellular stores of Ca<sup>2+</sup>). The 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptors have a very high density in the choroid plexus, an epithelial tissue that is the primary site of cerebrospinal fluid production. See, Sanders-Bush, E. and S.E. Mayer, "5-Hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin) Receptor agonists and

Antagonists", Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Chapter 1 , 9<sup>th</sup> Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY (1996).</p><p num="p0005">Julius, et al., isolated and characterized the 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor and later reported that transgenic mice lacking the 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor exhibit seizures and an eating disorder resulting in increased consumption of food (see, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,985,352 and 5,698,766, respectively). Consequently, compounds selective for the 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor may provide useful therapies for the treatment of seizure and eating disorders without the side effects typically associated with nonselectivity of the ligand. Several compounds have been proposed as 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor agonists or antagonists for use in the treatment of obesity and other related diseases associated with decreased neurotransmission of serotonin in mammals. See, e.g., EP 863136 (azetidine and pyrrolidine derivatives); EP 657426 (tricyclic pyrrole derivatives); EP 655440 (substituted 1-aminoethyl indoles); EP 572863 (pyrazinoindole derivatives); WO98/030548 (aminoalkylindazole compounds); WO 98/56768 (tricyclic pyrrole and pyrazole derivatives); WO 99/43647 (azetidine and pyrrolidine derivatives); WO 99/58490 (aryl- hydronaphthalenalkanamine derivatives); WO 00/12475 (indoline derivatives); WO 00/12482 (indazole derivatives); WO 00/12502 (pyrroloquinoline derivatives); WO 00/12510 (pyrroloindole, pyridoindole and azepinoindole derivatives); WO 00/28993 (naphthylacetylpiperazine derivatives); WO 00/44737 (aminoalkylbenzofuran derivatives); and WO 00/76984 (2,3- disubstituted pyrazines).</p><p num="p0006">The non-selectivity of ligands for the various 5-HT receptors remains a challenge. It is suspected that the non-selectivity of some ligands contributes to various adverse side effects such as hallucinations and cardiovascular complications. Therefore, there remains a need for selective 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor ligands.

In another embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of the present invention have been found to be useful in the treatment of sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a significant clinical problem, which can affect both males and females. The causes of SD may be both organic as well as psychological. Organic aspects of SD are typically caused by underlying vascular diseases, such as those associated with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, by prescription medication and/or by psychiatric disease 
<!-- EPO <DP n="43"/>-->
such as depression. Physiological factors include fear, performance anxiety and interpersonal conflict. SD impairs sexual performance, diminishes self- esteem and disrupts personal relationships thereby inducing personal distress. In the clinic, SD disorders have been divided into female sexual dysfunction (FSD) disorders and male sexual dysfunction (MSD) disorders (Melman et al 1999). FSD is best defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression. Male sexual dysfunction (MSD) is generally associated with erectile dysfunction, also known as male erectile dysfunction (MED) (Benet et al 1994 - Male Erectile dysfunction assessment and treatment options. Comp. Ther. 20: 669-673.).</p><p num="p0120">The compounds of the invention are particularly beneficial for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of sexual dysfunction in the male (e.g. male erectile dysfunction - MED) and in the female - female sexual dysfunction (FSD), e.g. female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD). It is known that some individuals can suffer from male erectile dysfunction (MED). MED is defined as: "the inability to achieve and/or maintain a penile erection for satisfactory sexual performance" (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Impotence, 1993)"</p><p num="p0121">It has been estimated that the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) of all degrees (minimal, moderate and complete impotence) is 52% in men 40 to 70 years old, with higher rates in those older than 70 (Melman.A. &amp; Gingell, J.C. (1999). The epidemiology and pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction. J. Urology 161: 5-1 1). The condition has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient and their partner, often resulting in increased anxiety and tension which leads to depression and low self esteem. Whereas two decades ago, MED was primarily considered to be a psychological disorder (Benet, A.E. et a/ (1994), Male erectile dysfunction assessment and treatment options. Comp. Ther. 20: 669-673), it is now known that for the majority of patients there is an underlying organic cause. As a result, much progress has been made in identifying the mechanism of normal penile erection and the pathophysiology of MED. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="44"/>-->
 Penile erection is a haemodynamic event which is dependent upon the balance of contraction and relaxation of the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle and vasculature of the penis (Lerner, S.E. et a/ (1993). A review of erectile dysfunction: new insights and more questions. J. Urology 149: 1246-1255). Corpus cavernosal smooth muscle is also referred to herein as corporal smooth muscle or in the plural sense corpus cavemosa. Relaxation of the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle leads to an increased blood flow into the trabecular spaces of the corpus cavemosa, causing them to expand against the surrounding tunica and compress the draining veins. This produces a vast elevation in blood pressure which results in an erection (Naylor, A.M. (1998). Endogenous neurotransmitters mediating penile erection. Br. J. Urology 81 : 424-431).</p><p num="p0122">The changes that occur during the erectile process are complex and require a high degree of co-ordinated control involving the peripheral and central nervous systems, and the endocrine system (Naylor, 1998). Corporal smooth muscle contraction is modulated by sympathetic noradrenergic innervation via activation of postsynaptic αι adrenoceptors. MED may be associated with an increase in the endogenous smooth muscle tone of the corpus cavemosum. However, the process of corporal smooth muscle relaxation is mediated partly by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) neurotransmission. There are a number of other NANC neurotransmitters found in the penis, other than NO, such as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The main relaxing factor responsible for mediating this relaxation is nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesised from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Taub, H.C. et a/ (1993). Relationship between contraction and relaxation in human and rabbit corpus cavemosum. Urology 42: 698-704). It is thought that reducing corporal smooth muscle tone may aid NO to induce relaxation of the corpus cavemosum. During sexual arousal in the male, NO is released from neurones and the endothelium and binds to and activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) located in the smooth muscle cells and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="45"/>-->
endothelium, leading to an elevation in intracellular cyclic guanosine 3',5'- monophosphate (cGMP) levels. This rise in cGMP leads to a relaxation of the corpus cavemosum due to a reduction in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>],), via unknown mechanisms thought to involve protein kinase G activation (possibly due to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps and Ca<sup>2+</sup>- activated K<sup>+</sup> channels).</p><p num="p0123">The categories of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) are best defined by contrasting them to the phases of normal female sexual response: desire, arousal and orgasm (see S R Leiblum, (1998), Definition and Classification of Female Sexual Disorders, Int. J. Impotence Res., 10, S104-S106). Desire or libido is the drive for sexual expression. Its manifestations often include sexual thoughts either when in the company of an interested partner or when exposed to other erotic stimuli. Arousal includes the vascular response to sexual stimulation, an important component of which is genital engorgement and increased vaginal lubrication, elongation of the vagina and increased genital sensation/sensitivity and a subjective excitement response. Orgasm is the release of sexual tension that has culminated during arousal. Hence, FSD occurs when a woman has an absent, inadequate or unsatisfactory response in any one or more of these phases, usually desire, arousal or orgasm.</p><p num="p0124">The American Psychiatric Association classifies female sexual dysfunction (FSD) into four classes: FSAD, hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female orgasmic disorder (FOD), and sexual pain disorders (e.g. dyspareunia and vaginismus) [see the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)].</p><p num="p0125">DSM-IV defines the four classes as follows:</p><p num="p0126">HSDD - Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgement of deficiency or absence is made by the clinician, taking into account factors that affect functioning, such as age and the context of the persons life. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="46"/>-->
 FSAD - Persistent or recurrent inability to attain, or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement.</p><p num="p0127">FOD - Persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase. Women exhibit wide variability in the type or intensity of stimulation that triggers orgasm. The diagnosis of FOD should be based on the clinician's judgement that the woman's orgasmic capacity is less than would be reasonable for her age, sexual experience, and the adequacy of the sexual stimulation she receives. Sexual Pain Disorders such as Dyspareunia and Vaginismus.</p><p num="p0128">Dysparenuia - Recurrent or persistent genital pain associated with sexual intercourse. Vaginismus - Recurrent or persistent involuntary spasm of the musculature of the outer third of the vagina that interferes with sexual intercourse. HSDD is present if a woman has no or little desire to be sexual, and has no or few sexual thoughts or fantasies. This type of FSD can be caused by low testosterone levels, due either to natural menopause or to surgical menopause. Other causes in both pre-menopausal woman (i.e. woman who are pre-menopausal and who have not have hysterectomies) as well as post-menopausal women include illness, medications, fatigue, depression and/or anxiety. Factors having a potential (conscious or sub-conscious) psychological impact such as relationship difficulties or religious factors may be related to the presence of/development of HSDD in females. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV of the American Psychiatric Association defines Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) as being: "... a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement.</p><p num="p0129">The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. ...".</p><p num="p0130">The arousal response consists of vasocongestion in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia. The disturbance causes marked distress and/or interpersonal difficulty.

 FSAD is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting pre-, peri- and post-menopausal (± hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) women. It is associated with concomitant disorders such as depression, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and urogenital (UG) disorders. The primary consequences of FSAD are lack of engorgement/swelling, lack of lubrication and lack of pleasurable genital sensation. The secondary consequences of FSAD are reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving an orgasm. It has recently been hypothesised that there is a vascular basis for at least a proportion of patients with symptoms of FSAD (Goldstein et al., Int. J. Impot. Res., 10, S84-S90,1998) with animal data supporting this view (Park et al., Int. J. Impot. Res., 9, 27-37, 1997).</p><p num="p0131">Drug candidates for treating FSAD, which are under investigation for efficacy, are primarily erectile dysfunction therapies that promote circulation to male genitalia. They consist of two types of formulation, oral or sublingual medications (Apomorphine, Phentolamine, phosphodiesterase type 5</p><p num="p0132">(PDE5) inhibitors, e.g. Sildenafil), and prostaglandin (PGE-i) that are injected or administered transurethrally in men and topically to the genitalia in women.</p><p num="p0133">The compounds of the present invention are advantageous by providing a means for restoring a normal sexual arousal response - namely increased genital blood flow leading to vaginal, clitoral and labial engorgement. This will result in increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance and increased genital sensitivity. Hence, the present invention provides a means to restore, or potentiate, the normal sexual arousal response.</p><p num="p0134">By female genitalia herein we mean: "The genital organs consist of an internal and external group. The internal organs are situated within the pelvis and consist of ovaries, the uterine tubes, uterus and the vagina. The external organs are superficial to the urogenital diaphragm and below the pelvic arch. They comprise the mons pubis, the labia majora and minora pudendi, the clitoris, the vestibule, the bulb of the vestibule, and the greater vestibular

glands" (Gray's Anatomy, CD. Clemente, 13<sup>th</sup> American Edition). R.J. Levin teaches us that because "... male and female genitalia develop embryologically from the common tissue anlagen, [that] male and female genital structures are argued to be homologues of one another. Thus the clitoris is the penile homologue and the labia homologues of the scrotal sac. ..." (Levin, R.J. (1991), Exp. Clin. Endoc nol., 98, 61-69).</p><p num="p0135">In summary, FSAD is characterised by inadequate genital response to sexual stimulation. The genitalia do not undergo the engorgement that characterises normal sexual arousal. The vaginal walls are poorly lubricated, so that intercourse is painful. Orgasms may be impeded. Arousal disorder can be caused by reduced oestrogen at menopause or after childbirth and during lactation, as well as by illnesses, with vascular components such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Other causes result from treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or antihypertensive agents.</p><p num="p0136">FOD is the persistent or recurrent difficulty, delay in or absence of attaining orgasm following sufficient sexual stimulation and arousal, which causes personal distress.</p><p num="p0137">Sexual pain disorders (includes dyspareunia and vaginismus) are characterised by pain resulting from penetration and sexual activity and may be caused by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.</p><p num="p0138">According to a further aspect, the present invention additionally provides a method for the treatment and/or prevention of male sexual dysfunction (MSD), in particular male erectile dysfunction (MED) via treatment with a compound of the present invention as detailed hereinbefore.

For the avoidance of doubt, the aforementioned publications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><p num="p0175">Preferably, said 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor agonists are selective 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor agonists.</p><p num="p0176">Receptor binding data or binding selectivity data may not always correlate with or reflect functional data or functional selectivity data. For example, a compound may be a 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor agonist when binding assays are analysed, but functionally the compound may have the same potency at other 5-HT receptors. Thus, the term "selective" as used herein in relation to the present invention with respect to methods of treatment for sexual dysfunction means "functionally selective". Thus, according to another aspect, the present invention additionally provides the use of 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor agonists, preferably selective 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor agonists, for the treatment of FSD, preferably FSAD, FOD, HSDD or a sexual pain disorder (such as Dyspareunia or Vaginismus).</p><p num="p0177">According to the methods of the invention, a compound of the present invention or a combination of a compound of the present invention and at least one additional pharmaceutical agent is administered to a subject in need of such treatment, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. In the combination aspect of the invention, the compound of the present invention and at least one other pharmaceutical agent (e.g., anti- obesity agent described above) may be administered either separately or in the pharmaceutical composition comprising both. It is generally preferred that such administration be oral. However, if the subject being treated is unable to swallow, or oral administration is otherwise impaired or undesirable, parenteral or transdermal administration may be appropriate. According to the methods of the invention, when a combination of a compound of the present invention and at least one other pharmaceutical 
<!-- EPO <DP n="56"/>-->
agent are administered together, such administration can be sequential in time or simultaneous with the simultaneous method being generally preferred. For sequential administration, a compound of the present invention and the additional pharmaceutical agent can be administered in any order. It is generally preferred that such administration be oral. It is especially preferred that such administration be oral and simultaneous. When a compound of the present invention and the additional pharmaceutical agent are administered sequentially, the administration of each can be by the same or by different methods. According to the methods of the invention, a compound of the present invention or a combination of a compound of the present invention and at least one additional pharmaceutical agent (referred to herein as a "combination") is preferably administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, a compound of the present invention or a combination can be administered to a patient separately or together in any conventional oral, rectal, transdermal, parenteral, (for example, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous) intracistemal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, intravesical, local (for example, powder, ointment or drop), or buccal, or nasal, dosage form. Compositions suitable for parenteral injection generally include pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="57"/>-->
 These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. Prevention of microorganism contamination of the compositions can be accomplished with various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of injectable pharmaceutical compositions can be brought about by the use of agents capable of delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, a compound of the present invention or a combination is admixed with at least one inert customary pharmaceutical excipient (or carrier) such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate or (a) fillers or extenders (e.g., starches, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, silicic acid and the like); (b) binders (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyipyrrolidone, sucrose, acacia and the like); (c) humectants (e.g., glycerol and the like); (d) disintegrating agents (e.g., agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates, sodium carbonate and the like); (e) solution retarders (e.g., paraffin and the like); (f) absorption accelerators (e.g., quaternary ammonium compounds and the like); (g) wetting agents (e.g., cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate and the like); (h) adsorbents (e.g., kaolin, bentonite and the like); and/or (i) lubricants (e.g., talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl suifate and the like). In the case of capsules and tablets, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents.</p><p num="p0178">Solid compositions of a similar type may also be used as fillers in soft or hard filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, and the like. Solid dosage forms such as tablets, dragees, capsules, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and

others well known in the art. They may also contain opacifying agents, and can also be of such composition that they release the compound of the present invention and/or the additional pharmaceutical agent in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The drug can also be in micro- encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.</p><p num="p0179">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the compound of the present invention or the combination, the liquid dosage form may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, as for example, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1 ,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (e.g., cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame seed oil and the like), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.</p><p num="p0180">Besides such inert diluents, the composition can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p><p num="p0181">Suspensions, in addition to the compound of the present invention or the combination, may further comprise suspending agents, e.g., ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.</p><p num="p0182">Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration preferably comprise suppositories, which can be prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention or a combination with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers, such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ordinary room temperature but liquid at body temperature and

therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity thereby releasing the active component(s).</p><p num="p0183">Dosage forms for topical administration of the compounds of the present invention and combinations of the compounds of the present invention with anti-obesity agents may comprise ointments, powders, sprays and inhalants. The drugs are admixed under sterile condition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and any preservatives, buffers, or propellants that may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, and solutions are also intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p><p num="p0184">The following paragraphs describe exemplary formulations, dosages, etc. useful for non-human animals. The administration of the compounds of the present invention and combinations of the compounds of the present invention with anti-obesity agents can be effected orally or non-orally (e.g., by injection).</p><p num="p0185">An amount of a compound of the present invention or combination of a compound of the present invention with an anti-obesity agent is administered such that an effective dose is received. Generally, a daily dose that is administered orally to an animal is between about 0.01 and about 1 ,000 mg/kg of body weight, preferably between about 0.01 and about 300 mg/kg of body weight.</p><p num="p0186">Conveniently, a compound of the present invention (or combination) can be carried in the drinking water so that a therapeutic dosage of the compound is ingested with the daily water supply. The compound can be directly metered into drinking water, preferably in the form of a liquid, water- soluble concentrate (such as an aqueous solution of a water-soluble salt). Conveniently, a compound of the present invention (or combination) can also be added directly to the feed, as such, or in the form of an animal feed supplement, also referred to as a premix or concentrate. A premix or concentrate of the compound in a carrier is more commonly employed for the inclusion of the agent in the feed. Suitable carriers are liquid or solid, as 
<!-- EPO <DP n="60"/>-->
desired, such as water, various meals such as alfalfa meal, soybean meal, cottonseed oil meal, linseed oil meal, corncob meal and corn meal, molasses, urea, bone meal, and mineral mixes such as are commonly employed in poultry feeds. A particularly effective carrier is the respective animal feed itself; that is, a small portion of such feed. The carrier facilitates uniform distribution of the compound in the finished feed with which the premix is blended. Preferably, the compound is thoroughly blended into the premix and, subsequently, the feed. In this respect, the compound may be dispersed or dissolved in a suitable oily vehicle such as soybean oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, and the like, or in a volatile organic solvent and then blended with the carrier. It will be appreciated that the proportions of compound in the concentrate are capable of wide variation since the amount of the compound in the finished feed may be adjusted by blending the appropriate proportion of premix with the feed to obtain a desired level of compound. High potency concentrates may be blended by the feed manufacturer with proteinaceous carrier such as soybean oil meal and other meals, as described above, to produce concentrated supplements, which are suitable for direct feeding to animals. In such instances, the animals are permitted to consume the usual diet. Alternatively, such concentrated supplements may be added directly to the feed to produce a nutritionally balanced, finished feed containing a therapeutically effective level of a compound of the present invention. The mixtures are thoroughly blended by standard procedures, such as in a twin shell blender, to ensure homogeneity.</p><p num="p0187">If the supplement is used as a top dressing for the feed, it likewise helps to ensure uniformity of distribution of the compound across the top of the dressed feed.</p><p num="p0188">Drinking water and feed effective for increasing lean meat deposition and for improving lean meat to fat ratio are generally prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention with a sufficient amount of animal feed to provide from about 10<sup>"3</sup> to about 500 ppm of the compound in the feed or water. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="61"/>-->
 The preferred medicated swine, cattle, sheep and goat feed generally contain from about 1 to about 400 grams of a compound of the present invention (or combination) per ton of feed, the optimum amount for these animals usually being about 50 to about 300 grams per ton of feed. The preferred poultry and domestic pet feeds usually contain about 1 to about 400 grams and preferably about 10 to about 400 grams of a compound of the present invention (or combination) per ton of feed.</p><p num="p0189">For parenteral administration in animals, the compounds of the present invention (or combination) may be prepared in the form of a paste or a pellet and administered as an implant, usually under the skin of the head or ear of the animal in which increase in lean meat deposition and improvement in lean meat to fat ratio is sought.</p><p num="p0190">In general, parenteral administration involves injection of a sufficient amount of a compound of the present invention (or combination) to provide the animal with about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg/day of body weight of the drug. The preferred dosage for poultry, swine, cattle, sheep, goats and domestic pets is in the range of from about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg/day of body weight of drug.</p><p num="p0191">Paste formulations can be prepared by dispersing the drug in a pharmaceutically acceptable oil such as peanut oil, sesame oil, corn oil or the like.</p><p num="p0192">Pellets containing an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, pharmaceutical composition, or combination can be prepared by admixing a compound of the present invention or combination with a diluent such as carbowax, carnuba wax, and the like, and a lubricant, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, can be added to improve the pelleting process.</p><p num="p0193">It is, of course, recognized that more than one pellet may be administered to an animal to achieve the desired dose level which will provide the increase in lean meat deposition and improvement in lean meat to fat ratio desired. Moreover, implants may also be made periodically

Clean and disinfect the shaved area. Place the rat in dorsal recumbency. Make a mid-line incision from the external base of the penis, running caudally for approximately 2 cm. Locate and expose the internal structure of the penis and identify the corpus cavemosum. Make a mid-line laparotomy, approximately 4 cm in length to access the abdominal cavity. Pierce the abdominal wall via the caudal incision with a suitable trocar and cannula, taking care not to damage any internal organs. Place the implant body in the abdominal cavity with the catheter orientated caudally and pass the catheter tip through the body wall via the preplaced cannula.

Named Veterinary Surgeon (or Deputy) to issue a certificate of fitness to continue 2 days post surgery. Start using rats experimentally 7 days post surgery. Experimental Procedure:- Perform experiment in room with reverse light/dark conditions. On day of experiment, place rat in home cage on receiver pad (PhysioTel® Model RPC-1 , Data Sciences International Inc.) and leave to acclimatise for approximately one hour. Ensure that the rat has food and water ad lib. Take baseline reading of intra cavernosal pressure (ICP) for approximately 5 minutes. Transfer the data via a floppy disk to an Excel spreadsheet. Inject the rat with compound subcutaneously or via the jugular vein catheter (JVC). If using the JVC, flush through with sterile saline after dosing and seal with a saline / glucose lock solution. The interval between administration of compound and ICP measurement will vary with the compound to be tested. An interval of 30-60 min post s.c. injection is a good guide. The test compounds were dissolved in 50% β-cyclodextrin in saline. They were administered at a dose of 5-10mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c). Apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate (Sigma A-4393) at 60 μg/kg s.c. was used as a positive control as it has pro-erectile properties. Record ICP over a 15 minute period, starting at 30 minutes post injection i.e. from 30 to 35 minutes and repeat for two further 15 minute periods commencing at

The pelvic nerve was freed away from surrounding tissue and a Harvard bipolar stimulating electrode was placed around the nerve. The nerve was slightly lifted to give some tension, then the electrode was secured in position. Approximately 1 ml of light paraffin oil was placed around the nerve and electrode. This acts as a protective lubricant to the nerve and prevents blood contamination of the electrode. The electrode was connected to a Grass S88 Stimulator. The pelvic nerve was stimulated using the following parameters:- 5V, pulse width 0.5ms, duration of stimulus 20 seconds with a frequency of 16Hz. Reproducible responses were obtained when the nerve was stimulated every 15-20 minutes. Several stimulations using the above parameters were performed to establish a mean control response.

 All data are reported as mean + s.e.m. (standard error of the mean). Significant changes were identified using Student's t-tests. The test compounds were dissolved in 50% β-cyclodextrin in saline. They were administered at a dose of 5-10mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c).

The normal sexual arousal response consists of a number of physiological responses that are observed during sexual excitement. These changes such as vaginal, labial and clitoral engorgement result from increases in genital blood flow. Engorgement leads to increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance (relaxation of vaginal smooth muscle) and increases in vaginal and clitoral sensitivity. Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting up to 40% of pre-, peri- and postmenopausal (±HRT) women. The primary consequence of FSAD is reduced genital engorgement or swelling which manifests itself as a lack of vaginal lubrication and a lack of pleasurable genital sensation. Secondary consequences include reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving orgasm.

The most common cause of FSAD is decreased genital blood flow resulting in reduced vaginal, labial and clitoral engorgement (Berman, J., Goldstein, I., Werbin, T. etal. (1999a).

The potentiation was significant 30mins after s.c. dosing and remained elevated for circa 1 hr. The 5HT2c agonist had no effect on basal genital blood flow in the absence of PNS (see Table 8 below). This reinforces our view that a 5HT2c receptor agonist will enhance the arousal response by potentiating the mechanism(s) that control sexual arousal/genital blood flow, thereby treating FSAD, and will not induce arousal in the absence of sexual stimulation.
