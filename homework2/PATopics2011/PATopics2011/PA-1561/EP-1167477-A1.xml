curable resin composition for an aqueous paint, which
contains substantially no volatile organic compound
(hereinafter referred to as "VOC") and which, while
having a low minimum film-forming temperature
(hereinafter referred to as "MFT), forms a film having an
excellent anti-blocking property and being excellent in
various physical properties such as water resistance,
smoothness and weather resistance.</p><p num="0002">In recent years, environmental regulations have
become stricter with regard to reduction of toxicity and
VOC, and also from the viewpoint of saving resources, it
is demanded to use water in place of an organic solvent
as a solvent for a paint in the field of paint industry.
As a typical paint, an aqueous emulsion paint may be
mentioned which employs an aqueous emulsion resin as a
binder.</p><p num="0003">However, the aqueous emulsion resin has a specific
MFT, and when the temperature of the surface to be coated 
was lower than MFT, it was necessary to blend an organic
solvent as a coalescing agent for film-formation.</p><p num="0004">On the other hand, in order to prevent blocking
which is likely to occur when coated plates are piled, it
is necessary to use a resin of high hardness as a binder.
However, a composition employing a resin of high hardness
has a high MFT, and it is again necessary to blend a
coalescing agent in a large amount. Thus, even an
aqueous emulsion paint contained a substantial amount of
VOC, and when drying of the coated film was inadequate,
there was a problem that the anti-blocking property or
water resistance tended to be poor due to the remaining
VOC.</p><p num="0005">Further, with respect to an aqueous emulsion paint,
a study has been made on a paint having both properties
of a low temperature film-forming property and an anti-blocking
property. As a result, as shown in JP-A-2-175742,
JP-A-7-26196, JP-A-11-349828, etc., a paint
having a good anti-blocking property has been developed
which comprises an emulsion resin having carbonyl groups,
having a relatively low MFT, and a compound having
hydrazide groups, wherein particles are crosslinked to
one another to improve the anti-blocking property.
However, there has been a problem that, although a
certain level of an anti-blocking property can be
obtained only by such crosslinking of particles, the
anti-blocking property is inadequate under severe 
conditions.</p><p num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of such
problems of the prior art, and it is an object of the
present invention to provide a resin composition for an
aqueous paint which is excellent in the low temperature
film-forming property and which forms a coating film
excellent in the anti-blocking property and in the water
resistance, smoothness, weather resistance, etc., without
using VOC such as coalescing agent which is likely to
cause environmental pollution or bad odor, or by an
addition of a small amount of VOC, if used.</p><p num="0007">In order to accomplish the above object, the present
inventors have conducted an extensive study and as a
result, they have found it possible to certainly
accomplish the above object by the following construction
and have arrived at the present invention.</p><p num="0008">Namely, the present invention provides a resin
composition for an aqueous paint, which comprises (a) a
binder composed of different phase structure emulsion
particles obtained by multi-stage emulsion polymerization,
and (b) a compound having at least two hydrazide groups
in its molecule, wherein the different phase structure
emulsion particles have an outermost phase formed of an
emulsion polymer which is an emulsion polymer of an
ethylenic unsaturated monomer, having a glass transition
temperature of from -50°C to 15°C, and the following
conditions (1) to (3) are satisfied: <sl><li>(1) the emulsion polymer forming the outermost phase
contains from 1 to 25 mass% of an ethylenic unsaturated
monomer having a carbonyl group,</li><li>(2) at least one phase located inside the outermost
phase of the different phase structure emulsion particles,
is formed of an emulsion polymer of an ethylenic
unsaturated monomer, having a glass transition
temperature of from 50°C to 150°C, and</li><li>(3) the binder has a minimum film-forming
temperature of at most 30°C.</li></sl></p><p num="0009">Now, the present invention will be described in
detail.</p><p num="0010">The binder (a) constituting the resin composition
for an aqueous paint of the present invention is one
composed of different phase structure emulsion particles
prepared by multi-stage emulsion polymerization of an
ethylenic unsaturated monomer in water.</p><p num="0011">The multi-stage emulsion polymerization is carried
out by at least 2 stages, usually from 2 to 5 stages of
emulsion polymerization of an ethylenic unsaturated
monomer in water in accordance with a well known emulsion
polymerization process, so that the emulsion polymer of
an ethylenic unsaturated monomer thereby formed
constitutes different phase structure emulsion particles
comprising the outermost phase and one or more inner
phases.</p><p num="0012">A typical example of the multi-stage emulsion 
polymerization process may be a process comprising a
plurality of steps of repeating emulsion polymerization
of an ethylenic unsaturated monomer at an elevated
temperature of from 60 to 90°C in the presence of an
emulsifying agent and a polymerization initiator, and
further optionally a chain transfer agent and an emulsion
stabilizer.</p><p num="0013">Examples of the emulsifier include anionic
surfactants, such as an aliphatic acid salt such as
sodium lauryl sulfate, a higher alcohol sulfuric acid
ester salt, an alkylbenzene sulfonate such as sodium
dodecylbenzene sulfonate, a polyoxyethylenealkylether
sulfuric acid salt, ammonium polyoxyethylenephenylether
sulfonate, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol ether
sulfuric acid salt, and a so-called reactive emulsifier
having a sulfonic acid group or a sulfuric ester group
and a polymerizable carbon-carbon unsaturated double bond
in its molecule; nonionic surfactants, such as a
polyoxyethylene alkylether, polyoxynonylphenylether, a
sorbitan aliphatic acid ester, a polyoxyethylene
aliphatic acid ester, a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene
block copolymer, and a reactive nonionic surfactant
having the above-mentioned group and polymerizable
carbon-carbon unsaturated double bond in its molecule;
cationic surfactants such as, an alkylamine salt and a
quaternary ammonium salt; and (modified)polyvinyl alcohol.</p><p num="0014">Examples of the polymerization initiator include 
those generally used for radical polymerization, and
among them, a water-soluble material is preferable. For
example, persulfates such as potassium persulfate and
ammonium persulfate, azo type compounds such as 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride,
4,4'-azobiscyanovaleric
acid and 2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutaneamidoxime)dihydrochloride
tetrahydrate, and
peroxides such as aqueous hydrogen peroxide and t-butylhydroperoxide,
may be mentioned. Further, a redox
type compound including a combination of ferrous sulfate
with a reducing agent such as L-ascorbic acid and sodium
thiosulfate, is also useful.</p><p num="0015">Examples of the chain transfer agent include long
chain alkylmercaptans such as N-dodecylmercaptan,
aromatic mercaptans and halogenated hydrocarbons.</p><p num="0016">Examples of the emulsion stabilizer include
polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxylethylcellulose and
polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p><p num="0017">The emulsion polymerization is carried out by a one
time-charging method of charging a monomer all at once, a
monomer-dropping method of continuously dropping a
monomer, a preemulsion method of previously mixing and
emulsifying a monomer, water and an emulsifier and
dropping the emulsified product, or a combination of
these methods.</p><p num="0018">According to the present invention, in the
preparation of different phase structure emulsion 
particles as a binder in accordance with the above-mentioned
methods, as an ethylenic unsaturated monomer
which is added at the final stage of multi-stage emulsion
polymerization and forms the outermost phase, it is
necessary to use an ethylenic unsaturated monomer having
a carbonyl groups in an amount of from 1 to 25 mass%,
preferably from 5 to 20 mass%, of the total ethylenic
unsaturated monomers to form the outermost phase, in
combination with such an ethylenic unsaturated monomer as
to provide an emulsion copolymer of the outermost phase
having a glass transition temperature (hereinafter
referred to as "Tg") of from -50°C to 15°C, preferably
from -30°C to 10°C. Also, it is necessary to use, for at
least one of inner phases, such an ethylenic unsaturated
monomer as to provide an emulsion copolymer having a Tg
of from 50°C to 150°C, preferably from 55°C to 100°C.</p><p num="0019">Also, it is necessary to use a binder having a
minimum film-forming temperature (MFT) of at most 30°C,
preferably at most 20°C. The lower limit of MFT may, for
example, be 0°C, but the lower limit temperature is not
limited to such a level.</p><p num="0020">By satisfying these conditions, it is possible to
form a coating film without using or with use of only a
very small amount of a VOC such as a coalescing agent,
and it is possible to form a coating film excellent in
the anti-blocking property or the water resistance.</p><p num="0021">In the present invention, Tg of an emulsion 
copolymer is one calculated in accordance with the
following FOX formula.
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">1/Tg=W<st32:sub pos="post">1</st32:sub>/Tg<st32:sub pos="post">1</st32:sub>+W<st32:sub pos="post">2</st32:sub>/Tg<st32:sub pos="post">2</st32:sub>+ ····+W<st32:sub pos="post">i</st32:sub>/Tg<st32:sub pos="post">i</st32:sub>+····+W<st32:sub pos="post">n</st32:sub>/Tg<st32:sub pos="post">n</st32:sub></st32:df>
(In the above FOX formula, Tg<sub>i</sub>(K) represents the glass
transition temperature of a homopolymer of each monomer
constituting a polymer comprising n kinds of monomers,
and W<sub>i</sub> represents the mass% of each monomer, i.e.
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">(W<st32:sub pos="post">1</st32:sub>+W<st32:sub pos="post">2</st32:sub>+···+W<st32:sub pos="post">i</st32:sub>+···W<st32:sub pos="post">n</st32:sub>=1.)</st32:df></p><p num="0022">In the present invention, if Tg of the emulsion
copolymer of the outermost phase of different phase
structure emulsion particles is lower than -50°C, a
coating film obtained therefrom tends to be poor in
pollution resistance and water resistance. On the
contrary, if Tg exceeds 15°C, film-formability tends to
be poor at a low temperature.</p><p num="0023">Further, if MFT of the binder exceeds 30°C, film-formability
tends to be poor unless a coalescing agent is
used in a large amount.</p><p num="0024">Now, the ethylenic unsaturated monomer used for
forming different phase structure emulsion particles will
be explained.</p><p num="0025">As described above, it is necessary for the
ethylenic unsaturated monomer used for an emulsion
copolymer forming the outermost phase to contain an
ethylenic unsaturated monomer having a carbonyl group as
the essential component. Such a monomer may, for example,
be acrolein, diacetone (meth)acrylamide, formylstyrol, a 
(meth)acryloxyalkylpropanol, diacetone (meth)acrylate,
acetonyl (meth)acrylate, acetoacetoxyethyl (meth)acrylate,
2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate/acetylacetate, butanediol-1,4-acrylate/acetylacrylate,
vinyl ethyl ketone or vinyl
isobutyl ketone.</p><p num="0026">Among them, acrolein, diacetone acrylamide or vinyl
ethyl ketone is particularly preferred.</p><p num="0027">If such an ethylenic unsaturated monomer having a
carbonyl group is less than 1 mass% in the total
ethylenic unsaturated monomer constituting the outermost
layer, no adequate crosslinking among particles can be
attained, and the anti-blocking property tends to
deteriorate. On the other hand, if it exceeds 25 mass%,
the water resistance, etc., tend to be poor, such being
undesirable.</p><p num="0028">Further, various ethylenic unsaturated monomers
commonly used in the preparation of acrylic resins can be
used without any restriction as comonomers
copolymerizable with the ethylenic unsaturated monomer
having a carbonyl group.</p><p num="0029">Typical examples of such comonomers include
(meth)acrylate type monomers such as methyl
(meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, n-propyl
(meth)acrylate, isopropyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl
(meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate, pentyl
(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, decyl
(meth)acrylate, dodecyl (meth)acrylate, stearyl 
(meth)acrylate, α-chloroethyl (meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl
(meth)acrylate, phenyl (meth)acrylate, methoxyethyl
(meth)acrylate, ethoxyethyl (meth)acrylate, methoxypropyl
(meth)acrylate and ethoxypropyl (meth)acrylate; styrene
type monomers such as styrene, methylstyrene,
chlorostyrene and methoxystyrene; carboxyl group-containing
monomers such as (meth)acrylic acid, crotonic
acid, itaconic acid, itaconic acid half ester, maleic
acid and maleic acid half ester; hydroxyl group-containing
monomers such as 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate,
2(3)-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl
acrylate and mono(meth)acrylic acid ester of allyl
alcohol polyhydric alcohol; amide group-containing
monomers such as (meth)acrylamide and maleinamide; amino
group-containing monomers such as 2-aminoethyl
(meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, 3-aminopropyl
(meth)acrylate, 2-butylaminoethyl
(meth)acrylate and vinylpyridine; epoxy group-containing
monomers and oligomers obtained by reacting an active
hydrogen atom-containing ethylenic unsaturated monomer
with an epoxy compound having at least 2 glycidyl groups,
glycidyl (meth)acrylate or allylglycidyl ether; and N-methylol
acrylamide having a N-methylol group, vinyl
acetate, vinyl chloride, ethylene, butadiene,
acrylonitrile, and a dialkyl fumarate.</p><p num="0030">As described above, these comonomers are used
optionally in such a combination as to provide an 
emulsion copolymer forming the outermost phase having Tg
of from -50°C to 15°C and a binder having MFT of at most
30°C.</p><p num="0031">Further, as the ethylenic unsaturated monomer used
for an emulsion copolymer forming at least one of inner
phases of different phase structure emulsion particles,
the same ethylenic unsaturated monomers as exemplified
above can be used, but it is necessary to use them
optionally in such a combination as to provide an
emulsion copolymer having Tg of from 50 to 150°C and a
binder having MFT of at most 30°C.</p><p num="0032">It is particularly preferred that the emulsion
copolymer of at least one of inner phases has an internal
crosslinked structure, whereby MFT can be lowered without
lowering the anti-blocking property.</p><p num="0033">The emulsion copolymer having an internal
crosslinked structure can be produced by a method, such
as a method of using a monomer having at least two
polymerizable unsaturated double bonds in its molecule,
such as divinylbenzene, ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate,
trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate or allyl
(meth)acrylate; a method of using a combination of
monomers having functional groups which mutually react at
a temperature during the emulsion polymerization reaction,
for example, a monomer mixture selectively comprising
ethylenic unsaturated monomers having a combination of
functional groups, such as a carboxyl group and a 
glycidyl group, or a hydroxyl group and an isocyanate
group; or a method of using a monomer mixture comprising
silyl group-containing ethylenic unsaturated monomers,
such as (meth)acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane,
(meth)acryloxypropyl triethoxysilane and
(meth)acryloxypropylmethyl dimethoxysilane, which undergo
a hydrolytic condensation reaction.</p><p num="0034">In the present invention, it is advisable to select
and use a monomer so that MFT of the binder composed of
different phase structure emulsion particles will be

in the form of a dispersion (emulsion) in water as a
clear paint, but in order to impart various functions to
a paint, it is preferable to incorporate various
additives, such as a dispersant, an anti-settling agent,
a thickening agent, an antiseptic agent, a UV ray-absorber,
a photostabilizer, and a pigment such as a
extender pigment, a coloring pigment or a rust-preventing 
pigment.</p><p num="0040">A paint obtained in this manner is applicable to
