of physical
forms and which produce a silky feel when applied to the skin
are prepared by reacting an unsaturated organopolysiloxane
resin, an Si-H functional organosiloxane crosslinker bearing
pendant hydrido functionality, a C<sub>4</sub> or higher unsaturated
hydrocarbon, and optionally, an unsaturated hydrophile
component. Products ranging from viscous liquids, creamy gels,
pastes, and soft powders may be obtained. The products are
highly useful in formulating cosmetic and pharmaceutical
products.</p> </abstract> <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention pertains to oleaginous alkyl group-substituted
silicone gels, processes for their preparation, and
use thereof.</p> <p num="0002">Organopolysiloxanes have been used in numerous cosmetic
applications for many years. In some of these applications,
for example, organopolysiloxanes such as silicone fluids have
been employed, either in their native form as oleaginous
carriers for other cosmetic ingredients, or in the form of oil-in-water
emulsions. In many of the latter cases, a surfactant
is necessary in order to keep the silicone fluid in stable
suspension or dispersion. Somewhat more recently, numerous
cosmetic formulations have employed creams or pastes which
include organopolysiloxane gels containing volatile
organosiloxanes.</p><p num="0003">U.S. Patent 5,654,362 discloses silicone gels prepared by
reacting a linear, Si-H functional polysiloxane with an α,ω-diene,
for example 1,5-hexadiene, in the presence of a platinum
hydrosilylation catalyst and a low molecular weight silicone
oil. The reaction is continued until a gel is formed following
which the silicone gel may be crumbled into a powder, or by
addition of further silicone oil, may form a silicone paste.
The products are employed to thicken hydrophobic liquids such
as silicone oils to a gel-like consistency. A variety of
cosmetic products such as an anti-perspirants, deodorants, skin
creams, etc.,are disclosed. The use of flammable diene
hydrocarbons in the preparation is a disadvantage. Moreover,
creams formed from solid powders are said not to provide
acceptable properties, as indicated by U.S. Patent 4,980,167,
wherein such formulations are said to suffer from lack of
lubricity. Similar products prepared from α,ω-dienes and
polyether-functional siloxanes are disclosed in U.S. 5,136,068. </p><p num="0004">However, preparation of water-in-oil emulsions from these
compositions still requires use of a separate emulsifying
surfactant.</p><p num="0005">U.S. Patent 4,987,169 discloses preparation of linear and
lightly crosslinked organosiloxanes in the presence of silicone
oils to form soft powdery or soft, translucent solid particles.
The crosslinked organosiloxanes are preferably prepared
employing Si-H and vinyl-functional linear organopolysiloxanes,
crosslinked through the aid of a hydrosilylation catalyst.
Because of the limited crosslinking of the crosslinked
organosiloxanes, the amount of the latter necessary to produce
the solid product is high, for example 30 to 50% by weight.
The product is thus relatively expensive. The soft powders may
be used as thickeners in solubilizing additional silicone oil
to form greasy compositions stated to be useful in cosmetics
and lubricants. The deficiencies of the '169 patent are
attested to in U.S. Patent 5,760,116, which discloses products
prepared in two stages, in a first step, preparing a highly
crosslinked gel from an Si-H functional organopolysiloxane
resin in the presence of a minor amount of low viscosity
organopolysiloxane, and in a second step, adding further
organopolysiloxane oil into the gel under high shear to produce
a clear, highly viscous liquid. The disadvantage of two stage
production is clear.</p><p num="0006">U.S. Patent, 5,859,069 discloses a gelatinous external skin
treatment composition prepared from an organopolysiloxane
elastomer powder having spherical particles with an average
particle size of 1.0 to 15.0 µm, a silicone oil, and a
polyether-modified silicone. The '069 patent indicates that
prior formulations employing silicone resins are unsuitable for
such uses, as they leave a filmy feeling on the skin. The
polyether-modified, resin-free (linear) silicone is disclosed
as being absolutely necessary; and if amounts of less than 1.0%
by weight are used, gelation becomes insufficient and the 
composition becomes unsuitable for use in cosmetics.
Gelatinous external skin treatment compositions containing the
spherical powder, 5-75% by weight of silicone oil, and 1-20%
by weight of polyether-modified silicone are disclosed.
Preparation of the elastomer particles is not straightforward,
and creams containing solid powders have been viewed as
undesirable, as previously discussed.

Polyether-functionalized silicone surfactants are disclosed in
U.S. Patents 5,412,004 and 5,236,986. In each case, a
polyether-functional linear Si-H containing organopolysiloxane
is reacted with an α,ω-divinyl organopolysiloxane. A further
series of compounds are prepared by cross-linking employing an
α,ω-bis(unsaturated) polyoxyalkylene polyether instead of the
α,ω-divinylsiloxane. However, gels are not formed, and
incorporation of silicone oil into the compositions must be
performed using high shear kneading. The products contain a
high weight percentage of polyether moieties (ca 15% in the
examples). The synthesis must necessarily take place in
several steps. The additional step of kneading with silicone
oil is disadvantageous. Moreover, the α,ω-bis(unsaturated)
polyethers are expensive to prepare.</p><p num="0007">U.S. Patent 5,811,487 describes low molecular weight siloxane
fluids thickened with silicone elastomers prepared by reaction
of Si-H functional siloxanes and an α,ω-unsaturated diene
hydrocarbon, the Si-H siloxane first having been partially
reacted with a monoalkenyl functionalized polyether to provide
polyether functionality. The necessity of employing α,ω-dienes
is disadvantageous, as previously discussed.</p><p num="0008">U.S. Patent 5,854,336 discloses a process for preparing
cosmetic products which involves feeding a silicone elastomer
composition consisting of a silicone rubber and a carrier fluid
into a reactor, mixing the composition in the reactor,
delivering the composition from the reactor to a high pressure
pump, and from there into a device for reducing the particles 
of rubber into smaller sizes. The device for reducing particle
size is preferably a high pressure feed homogenizer, most
preferably a sonolator. Use of high pressure pumps and devices
such as sonolators increase the expense of the product. Stable
emulsions and creams containing water and glycols either cannot
be prepared, or are difficult to prepare, due to the
incompatibility of the hydrophobic silicone and hydrophilic
water/glycols.</p><p num="0009">EP 0 790 055 A1 discloses compositions containing a partially
reticulated elastomeric organopolysiloxane and a fatty
component such as a triglyceride for use in skin care or make-up
formulas. What is meant by "partially reticulated" is not
defined in the specification, which refers to U.S. Patent
5,266,321 for its description of suitable organopolysiloxanes.</p><p num="0010">Examples of cosmetic formulations employing silicone gels are
also disclosed in International PCT Applications WO97/44010;
WO98/18438; WO98/00105; WO98/00104; WO98/00103; WO98/00102, and
like patents. It can be clearly seen from such patents that
the range of formulations includes anti-perspirants, both
liquid and solid, facial creams, moisturizers, and other
products. It should also be apparent from a review of these
references that there are considerable differences between the
variety of organosilicone gels. In particular, some of these
gels provide an unacceptable oily feeling when such is not
desired. Other gels are more difficult to produce, and
unnecessarily increase the cost of formulation. It would be
desirable to be able to produce gels in a simple fashion from
well-recognized readily available, and essentially non-toxic
ingredients, to produce a product which avoids the stringiness
of other gels, which can be dispersed without the use of
extremely high pressure devices such as sonolators and the
like, and without extensive high shear kneading, and which may
produce cosmetic products devoid of oiliness or filmy sensation
when applied to the skin. </p><p num="0011">Creamy gels prepared by polymerizing vinyl-functional MQ
resins, Si-H crosslinker, and unsaturated polyoxyalkylene
polyethers is disclosed in U.S. application Serial No.
09/522,480, filed March 10, 2000. Such gels are ideally suited
for forming aqueous creamy gels. Similar compositions with
somewhat different compatibility with water and other
hydrophilic (hydroxylic) solvents is disclosed in U.S.
application Serial No. 09/317,093, filed May 22, 1999. Both of
the foregoing applications are incorporated herein by
reference. While the aforementioned creamy gels have a wide
variety of uses, they suffer from several drawbacks as well.
First, the polyoxyalkylene portion of the molecule, due to its
hydrophilic nature, limits the ability to formulate with
oleophilic components in some instances. Second, the
unsaturated polyoxyalkylene compounds used to prepare the gels
tend to be relatively expensive. Third, many of the
compositions are strictly limited to gel-like or creamy gel
preparations. Finally, the compositions may not provide an
ideal feel to the skin when used in cosmetic applications.
It would be desirable to form powders and gel-like products
which can be used to broaden the formulation window employed,
in particular, by the cosmetics industry.</p><p num="0012">The present invention provides a process for the preparation of
a gel composition, said process comprising:
<sl><li>a) an unsaturated organopolysiloxane resin;</li><li>b) an Si-H functional organosiloxane crosslinker, at least 25
mol percent of said crosslinker bearing pendant hydrido
functionality and containing minimally 5 Si-H groups;</li><li>c) an unsaturated hydrocarbon component containing minimally
4 carbon atoms, and optionally containing interspersed
heteroatoms or heteroatom groups in a ratio of carbon
atoms in the backbone of the unsaturated hydrocarbon
moiety to heteroatoms of at least 4:1, or said hydrocarbon 
moiety containing minimally 8 carbon atoms and terminated</li></sl>
by a carboxylic acid amide or carboxylic acid ester group;
in the presence of a hydrosilylation catalyst;

wherein reacting of said unsaturated organopolysiloxane resin
and said Si-H functional crosslinker takes place in minimally
20 weight percent of liquid oleaginous component, and wherein
the ratio of total mol of unsaturated groups present to mol of
Si-H bound hydrogen is from 0.11 to 2.5.</p><p num="0013">It has now been surprisingly discovered that powders and gels
may be prepared by reacting an unsaturated organopolysiloxane
resin, an Si-H functional crosslinker bearing pendant hydrido
functionality, and a modifying moderate to long chain alkene or
a cycloalkene, the reaction taking place in the presence of an
oleaginous liquid, preferably a volatile silicone or aliphatic
or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon or mixture thereof. That gels,
and particularly powders, can be formed rather than only
solutions under these circumstances is surprising in view of
the presence of the modifying hydrocarbon groups which would be
expected to increase solubility in non-polar liquids.</p><p num="0014">The organopolysiloxane gels of the present invention can be
obtained in numerous forms including, but not limited to,
moderate to high viscosity liquids, pastes, clear gels, creamy
gels, and most surprisingly, high liquid content soft powders.
The products may be formulated with numerous ingredients, in
particular, ingredients useful in the cosmetics field. These
include, for example, water, emollients, humectants such as
propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, glycerine, etc., fatty
triglycerides, lanolin, essential oils, natural and synthetic
waxes and wax-like components, fragrances, alcohols, oleaginous
liquids including natural and synthetic oils, and the like.

The products thus have high versatility, and may be useful in
many products such as face powders, eye shadow, foundation,
lipstick, lip gloss, and the like. These uses are exemplary
only, and not limiting. Numerous uses in non-cosmetic areas of 
technology are possible as well. The powders display high
lubricity and a silky feel quite unlike ordinary powder
cosmetic ingredients.</p><p num="0015">The oleaginous component comprises minimally 20 weight percent
of the overall composition, preferably minimally 50 weight
percent, more preferably 60 weight percent or more, and most
preferably in the range of 65 to 90 weight percent. The
oleaginous component may be a single component or a mixture of
components. The oleaginous component is preferably nonreactive
with respect to the other reactive ingredients.
However, it is possible to employ oleaginous ingredients which
are partially reactive, for example naturally occurring oils or
esters or glycerides thereof containing mono- or multiply-unsaturated
fatty acids. Preferably, the oleaginous substances
are low viscosity and preferably volatile organopolysiloxanes
or saturated aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons, or mixtures
thereof.</p><p num="0016">The low viscosity and preferably volatile organopolysiloxane
may be a low molecular weight oligomeric polydialkylsiloxane,
or a cyclic siloxane, or mixtures thereof. Most preferably,
the low viscosity organopolysiloxane is an oligomeric
polydimethylsiloxane or a cyclic polydimethylsiloxane. Other
alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, and aralkyl groups are also acceptable,
of course, for example, phenyl groups, benzyl groups, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>
alkyl groups, and the like. However, because of cost
considerations and the ease of formulation, organopolysiloxanes
with methyl groups attached to the silicon atoms are highly
preferred. Cyclic polydimethylsiloxanes are most preferred.
However, linear trimethylsilyl(oxy)-terminated
polydimethylsiloxanes having an average from 2 to 50 silicon
atoms in the organopolysiloxane backbone may also be used. If
volatility is desired, the number of silicon atoms should be
greatly restricted, for example, to below 10, and preferably
below 6. However, if relatively low viscosity but non-volatile 
fluids can be tolerated, extensions of the organopolysiloxane
backbone to higher numbers of silicon atoms, for example, to 50
or 500 silicon atoms is possible. These non-volatile fluids
may have viscosities greater than about 10 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, and
preferably up to about 2000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s. The organopolysiloxanes may
also be slightly cross-linked, as long as the cross-linking
does not overly increase the viscosity. Viscosity is
preferably below 100 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, however, more preferably below 10
mm<sup>2</sup>/s, and most preferably, in the case of volatile
organopolysiloxanes, less than 5 mm<sup>2</sup>/s.</p><p num="0017">Preferably, the organopolysiloxanes are volatile
organopolysiloxanes. As indicated previously, volatility can
be achieved in linear organopolysiloxanes by selection of
oligomeric organopolysiloxanes with at most about 6 to 10
silicon atoms in the organopolysiloxane backbone. Preferably,
however, cyclic organopolysiloxanes having from 3 to 6 silicon
atoms are utilized, for example, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane,
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, dodeca-methylcyclohexasiloxane,
and the like. As with the linear organopolysiloxanes, groups
other than methyl groups may be present, for example, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>
alkyl groups, preferably C<sub>2-4</sub> alkyl groups, aryl groups, and
the like. In addition, and also as is the case for the linear
polysiloxanes, functional groups which do not interfere with
the stability of the organopolysiloxane gels or with the
ability to use these in cosmetic formulations may be tolerated.
In particular, examples include hydroxyl (silanol) groups,
alkoxy groups, for example, those which are relatively
hydrolytically stable, and the like. Compounds containing
reactive groups such as acetoxy groups, methoxy groups, ethoxy
groups and the like, should generally be avoided unless they
are retained for some special purpose in the cosmetic
formulations or used in non-cosmetic applications. It is not
desired to include any halo-functional compounds in the
organopolysiloxane gels. Please note in this respect that
minor amounts of such groups are sometimes unavoidable in 
organosiloxane resins due to their method of preparation, and
these minor amounts are tolerable.</p><p num="0018">Up to 50 percent by weight of the low molecular weight
organopolysiloxane component or even all of this component may
be replaced by one or more oleaginous substances. Thus, in the
claims, the term "oleaginous composition" is used to describe
the oily, hydrophobic component which is added during
preparation of the gel. This composition does not include any
additional oils which may be later added following preparation
of the gel, by dissolution, emulsification, or dispersion
following preparation of the gel.</p><p num="0019">Suitable oily substances include vitamin oils such as vitamins
A or E or related compounds such as α-tocopheryl acetate; fatty
oils, including ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and
their esters, retinol, retinoic acid, esters of the latter
retin compounds; vegetable oils such as peanut, olive, palm,
cannola, sunflower, and the like; mineral oils; flavoring or
"essential" or "aromatic oils" such as the various terpenes
both natural and synthetic, patchouli, myrrh, frankincense,
lavender, vanillin, sandalwood, eucalyptus, camphor, menthol,
and the like, or oily substances such as benzaldehyde,
cinnamaldehyde, and the like; and natural and synthetic oils or
oil-soluble solids such as various mono-, di- and
triglycerides, polyoxyalkylated vegetable oils, lanolin,
lecithin, and the like. More preferably, the oleaginous
composition contains 70% or more low molecular weight,
preferably volatile organopolysiloxanes, more preferably 80% or
more, and most preferably 90% or more. Oleophilic solvents,
particularly low odor paraffinic solvents which are
cosmetically and/or pharmaceutically acceptable and have
boiling points below 200°C, preferably in the range of 60°C to
150°C, may also be part of the oleaginous component, preferably
in amounts of less than 50% by weight based on the total weight 
of this component. These examples are illustrative and not
limiting.</p><p num="0020">The oleaginous substances may also comprise aliphatic and
alicyclic hydrocarbons, preferably saturated hydrocarbons. The
aliphatic hydrocarbons may be straight chain or branched, and
the alicyclic hydrocarbons may constitute unsubstituted cyclic
hydrocarbons or aliphatic hydrocarbyl-substituted hydrocarbons.
Examples of suitable hydrocarbons include n-heptane, n-octane,
isooctane, n-decane, isodecane, n-dodecane, isododecane,
cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, methylcyclohexane,
dimethylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, nonylcyclohexane, and
the like. This list is also illustrative and not limiting.</p><p num="0021">Suitable oleaginous compounds also include oil-like polyethers
such as bis(alkyl) ethers of low molecular weight glycols, and
liquid oligomeric and polymeric polyoxyalkylene glycols, their
alkyl mono- and di-ethers, and mono- and dialkylesters. It is
preferable that the majority of the polyoxyalkylene glycols be
prepared from a majority (&gt;50 mol percent) of alkylene oxides
having greater than 2 carbon atoms; i.e., propylene oxide, 1,2-and
2,3-butylene oxide, tetrahydrofuran, oxetane, cyclohexene
oxide, and the like.</p><p num="0022">All or a portion of the oleaginous component may comprise one
or more essential oils or fragrance oils, such as oil of
rosemary, thyme oil, patchouli oil, sandalwood oil, oil of
camphor, oil of menthol, etc. Use of perfume oils to form soft
powders according to the invention provide a novel vehicle for
the formulation of powdery solid, gel-like or creamy gel
perfume products.</p><p num="0023">Numerous admixtures of oleaginous substances may be used,
limited only to those compositions which do not phase-separate
following preparation of the gel product. It is highly
preferred that the oleaginous component be a volatile cyclic or 
low molecular weight siloxane or organopolysiloxane, or
mixtures thereof, a moderate volatility hydrocarbon or
hydrocarbon mixture, or a mixture of these siloxanes and
hydrocarbons. Particularly useful organosiloxane mixtures are
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,350,440. These siloxanes have a
most useful evaporation profile.</p><p num="0024">A necessary component of the reaction mixture used to prepare
the organopolysiloxane gel is an unsaturated, preferably vinyl
functional resin, for example MQ resin or similar, highly
crosslinked resin containing M, Q, and/or T moieties, and
optionally a minor amount of D moieties. Such resins are by
now well-known in the art. In the organopolysiloxane art, the
term "resin" is not applied to polymers in general, but is
restricted for the use in describing relatively highly cross-linked
and often high molecular weight products produced by the
reaction of silanes which are capable of forming three-dimensional
networks. The term "M" refers to monofunctional
units while the term "Q" refers to tetrafunctional units. In
other words, an MQ resin contains predominantly M units wherein
silicon is attached to only one oxygen in the cross-linked
molecules, and SiO<sub>4/2</sub> "Q" units wherein each silicon atom is
attached to four other oxygen atoms, resulting in a high level
of cross-linking. In some MQ resins, small amounts of
difunctional R<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2/2</sub> and trifunctional RSiO<sub>3/2</sub> (" D" and "T"
units, respectfully), are also present. MQ resins are
frequently produced by the hydrolysis of silanes such as
tetraethoxysilane, vinyldimethylethoxysilane and
trimethylethoxysilane. The resulting MQ resin frequently
retains some residual alkoxy functionality as a result of the
method of its preparation, and will occasionally include other
functionalities such as silanol or halo functionality as well.
A preferred MQ resin is MQ resin 804, available from Wacker
Silicones Corporation, Adrian, Michigan, which contains
approximately 1.2 to 1.8 weight percent vinyl functionality.
MQ resins having unsaturation other than vinyl, including 
vinyloxy, allyl, allyloxy, propenyl, etc., are less commonly
available, but may be used also. The various unsaturated
resins may be used alone or in admixture with other unsaturated
resins. Minor amounts of unsaturated non-resinous
organopolysiloxanes may be used as well, provided a stable gel
can be obtained. The term "resin" is used herein in its
customary meaning, i.e. a highly three dimensionally
crosslinked polymer containing a majority of M units, and T
and/or Q units. MT, MQ, and MQT resins are thus preferred,
optionally containing less than 10 mol percent D units with
respect to the mol percent of M units present.</p><p num="0025">The unsaturated silicone resins, as indicated, can contain a
variety of hydrosilatable unsaturated groups, including both
ethylenic and ethylynic unsaturation. It is preferable,
although not mandatory, that the unsaturation be terminal. For
example, in hexenyl unsaturated groups, terminal (ω-) hexenyl
groups are preferred. The unsaturated groups may also, as
indicated, be unsaturated ether groups such as vinyl ether
groups, and may be other heteroatom containing groups as well,
i.e. (meth)acryloxy groups. Vinyl and allyl groups are most
preferable, as these are commercially more easily obtainable at
reasonable cost. However, groups such as ω -hexenyl or ω-octenyl
may allow preparation of products with unusual property
profiles and uses.

The Si-H functional organopolysiloxane cross-linking agent is a
necessary part of the present gel formulation. While Si-H-terminated
organopolysiloxanes may be used as crosslinkers,
past experience indicates that gels prepared from such
compounds may tend to have a stringy appearance or may form
only liquid products of low viscosity unless the solids
content, i.e., of the non-oleaginous components, is quite high.
The modifying alkene used in the present invention, as well as
mono-unsaturated polyethers, will react with the terminal Si-H
groups thus acting like "chain stoppers," thus, inhibiting the
crosslinking reaction. Preferably the crosslinker must 
comprise, in substantial part, an Si-H functional
organopolysiloxane which contains Si-H functional units along
its polymer backbone. The Si-H functional organopolysiloxane
may or may not, in addition to these Si-H functional units,
also include terminal Si-H units. A preferred crosslinker is
EL Crosslinker 525, a poly(methylhydrogen)-dimethylsiloxane
containing approximately 0.54 weight percent silicon-bonded
hydrogen atoms, and having a weight average molecular weight of
ca. 29,100 Daltons, measured with a 2-column SEC, refractive
index detector, calibrated with polystyrene. The weight
average molecular weight of the crosslinker may vary from about
134 Da to preferably 40,000 Da or higher, preferably from 5000
Da to 40,000 Da, and more preferably from 10,000 Da to 35,000
Da. The crosslinkers must contain minimally 3 Si-H bound
hydrogens, and preferably contain in excess of 5 Si-H bound
hydrogens per molecule, more preferably 10 or more, and most
preferably 20 or more.</p><p num="0026">By the term "pendant hydrido functionality" is meant
organopolysiloxanes where at least a portion of the total Si-H
functionality is located along the polymer backbone, i.e., in
groups such as methylhydrogensiloxy or ethylhydrogensiloxy
groups. Terminal Si-H functionality may also be present, so
long as pendant hydrido functionality is present as well. It
is possible to employ an Si-H functional organopolysiloxanes
having only terminal unsaturation, such as
dimethylhydrogensiloxy-end capped polydimethylsiloxanes. The
useable proportions of such terminal Si-H functional siloxanes
is inversely proportional to molecular weight, with larger
amounts of α,ω-Si-H functional Si<sub>2</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>, and Si<sub>4</sub> di- and
oligosiloxanes being useful as compared to higher molecular
weight α,ω-Si-H functional organopolysiloxanes.</p><p num="0027">For reasons of cost, it is preferable that the majority of Si-bound
hydrocarbon groups in the Si-H functional crosslinkers be
methyl, ethyl, or phenyl groups, preferably methyl or ethyl 
groups, and most preferably methyl groups. However, other
higher molecular weight groups such as isooctyl, nonylphenyl,
and the like are also useful. The Si-H functional crosslinkers
may also contain alkoxy groups, particularly less reactive
higher alkoxy groups such as octyloxy or isooctyloxy groups.
While lower alkoxy groups such as methoxy or ethoxy groups are
relatively reactive, higher alkyl alkoxy groups are generally
far less reactive, many of these being stable in the presence
of water for extended periods of time. Preferably the Si-H
functional crosslinker is a (methylhydrogen)(dimethyl)
polysiloxane.
The unsaturated hydrocarbon component is a hydrosilylatable
hydrocarbon with at least 4 carbon atoms, preferably at least 6
carbon atoms, more preferably at least 8 carbon atoms, and most
preferably at least 10 carbon atoms. While there is no fixed
upper limit to the number of carbon atoms, it is preferable
that the unsaturated hydrocarbon component contain less than 30
carbon atoms, preferably less than 24 carbon atoms.

Preferably, the unsaturated hydrocarbon contains between 10
carbon atoms and 24 carbon atoms, more preferably between 12
and 20 carbon atoms.</p><p num="0028">The unsaturated hydrocarbon component may be straight chain,
branched, or cyclic, preferably alkenes. Examples include, but
are not limited to, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 2-butene, 2-pentene,
1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 1-octene, isooctene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene,
cyclohexene, methylcyclohexene, hexylcyclohexene,
norbornene, camphene, etc. Where the unsaturated hydrocarbon
moiety contains greater than 6 carbon atoms, the moiety may
contain one or more heteroatoms interspersed along the
backbone, i.e., 1-butenyloxybutane, vinyloxyhexane, and the
like. In addition, when the hydrocarbon moiety contains in
excess of 8 carbon atoms, it may contain a carboxylic acid or
ester group, for example linolenic acid or linolenic acid
methyl ester, a carboxylic acid amide group, or other polar
group. The hydrocarbon moiety must be essentially oleophilic, 
i.e., preferably has an HLB of less than 4, preferably less
than 2 when hydrophilic or polar groups are present. The ratio
of carbon atoms in the unsaturated hydrocarbon component to
heteroatoms O, N, or S must be at least 4:1, and more
preferably 6:1 or more.</p><p num="0029">Additional hydrosilylatable hydrocarbons may be present also,
but are not preferred, and their residues should comprise less
than 10 mol percent, preferably less than.5 mol percent based
on total unsaturated hydrocarbons of all types present. For
example, low molecular weight alkenes such as ethylene,
propylene, vinylmethyl ether, vinylethyl ether, and the like
may be employed. In cases where an excess of Si-H
functionality is employed to achieve higher hydrosilylation
conversion of hydrosilylatable groups, excess Si-H
functionality may be removed by addition of ethylene or
propylene, preferably under pressure. Excess ethylene or
propylene may be removed easily from the product due to their
low volatility, or left in the product due to their low
toxicity.</p><p num="0030">The subject invention organopolysiloxane gels may also be
prepared using an optional unsaturated hydrophile component in
addition to the unsaturated hydrocarbon component. Preferably,
no such component is employed. However, when employed, the
unsaturated hydrophile component and the unsaturated
hydrocarbon component may be present in a mol ratio of about
90:10, more preferably, in increasing order, 80:20, 60:40,
40:60, 20:80, 10:90, and 5:95. The unsaturated hydrophile may
include a hydrophilic group such as a saccharide or oligo- or
polysaccharide, a polyglyceride, a hydrophilic polyoxyalkylene
polyether, and the like, or may contain an ionic or other
highly polar group.</p><p num="0031">The hydrophilic function is preferably supplied by a
hydrophilic polyether group, or by polar groups such as 
hydroxyl groups, amide groups, carboxyl groups and their salts,
etc. Most preferably, the hydrophilic groups are non-ionic
hydrophiles such as polyoxyalkylene groups, polyglycol
moieties, oligosaccharides, and the like. Polyoxyethylene
groups are the preferred hydrophiles, particularly those
containing four or more, preferably 4-50, and more preferably 5
to 20 repeating oxyethylene and/or oxypropylene groups, as well
as those containing low numbers of oxypropylene groups may also
be suitable. Thus, the preferred hydrophiles correspond to the
formula
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">R<st32:sup pos="post">1</st32:sup>-O-(R-O)<st32:sub pos="post">n</st32:sub>-R<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup></st32:df>
where R<sup>1</sup> is an unsaturated hydrocarbon, R is an alkylene group,
preferably methylene, ethylene, methylethylene, 1,3-propylene
or tetramethylene, R<sup>2</sup> is H or CH<sub>3</sub>, and n is from 3 to about 20.
Most preferred unsaturated hydrophiles correspond to the
formula
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">CH<st32:sub pos="post">2</st32:sub>=CH-CH<st32:sub pos="post">2</st32:sub>-O-(R-O)<st32:sub pos="post">n</st32:sub>-R<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup></st32:df>
where R and R<sup>2</sup> are defined as before and n is 4-50, preferably
5-20, and more preferably 5-12, or to methyl capped polyethers
of similar structure. The distribution of alkylene groups when
different alkylene moieties are present may be random, block,
block-random, or any other distribution employed in polyether
surfactants. Non-ionic hydrophiles are most preferred.</p><p num="0032">Preferred hydrophiles are prepared by oxyalkylating allyl
alcohol in the presence of basic catalysts to form allyloxy-terminated,
ω-hydroxy polyether monols. Allyloxy-functional
polyoxyethylene monols are commercially available from Rhodia
Inc. as Rhodasurf® AAE-10 and from the Dow Chemical Company as
AE-400. Both products are nominal five to ten mole
oxyethylated allyl alcohol adducts containing a range of
oligomers. Also suitable as hydrophiles are oxyethylated 
unsaturated diols such as oxyethylated 1,4-butenediol and 1,4-butynediol,
and oxyethylated unsaturated carboxylic acids,
particularly T-alkenoic acids, or unsaturated diacids such as
fumaric acid, maleic acid, and the like. Hydrophiles with
carboxylate ester end groups or alkyl ether end groups are also
useful, particularly esters of lower C<sub>2-4</sub> alkanoic acids and
ethers of lower C<sub>1-4</sub> alkanols. Acetates and methoxy and ethoxy
ethers are some preferred carboxylate and ether terminal
groups. The end groups may also be carboxylic acid groups,
sulfonate groups, phosphanate groups, or their esters or salts.
The same modifications may be made to other unsaturated
hydrophiles.

Also suitable are alkenyl-functionalized polyhydroxy substances
such as polyglycerols and oligosaccharides. Polyglycerol, for
example, may be functionalized with allyl groups by reaction
with allyl chloride to form the polyglycerol allyloxy ether, or
with propenoic acid, propenoyl chloride, maleic acid, maleic
anhydride, or maleic acid chloride to form the corresponding
carboxylic acid ester(s). Syntheses for such compounds may be
found in the literature. Functionalization may also be
accomplished by reaction with unsaturated isocyanates such as
1-isocyanato-1,1-dimethyl-4-isopropenylbenzene (TMI) or
isocyanatoethylmethacrylate. Polyglycerols and
oligosaccharides and similar hydrophiles may be modified to
contain methoxy, ethoxy, carboxymethyl, or other modifying
groups.</p><p num="0033">The relative amounts of unsaturated silicone resin and
unsaturated hydrocarbon may be varied between wide limits
depending upon the nature of the product to be obtained.
Viscosity of liquid products generally increases with
increasing amounts of unsaturated silicone resin and increasing
chain length of the unsaturated hydrocarbon employed. Using
too low an amount of unsaturated silicone resin will produce
low viscosity products of little value, and if gel-like
products or solid products are desired, a reasonable amount of 
unsaturated silicone resin will be required. With a given Si-H
functional crosslinker, the amount of unsaturated silicone
resin used will in turn limit the amount of other unsaturated
ingredients such as unsaturated hydrocarbon which may be used.
However, the total amount of hydrosilylatable materials used
can be varied somewhat by employing a crosslinker with a higher
mol percent (and thus higher weight percent) of Si-H bound
hydrogen.</p><p num="0034">The ratio of moles of unsaturation in the resin to moles of Si-H
is preferably in the range of .07 to .74, more preferably .07
to .34, and most preferably .07 to .23. Ratios of .13 have
proven quite satisfactory when MQ resins are employed. The
ratio of moles of hydrocarbon unsaturation to moles of Si-H is
preferably in the range of 0.04 to 1.82, more preferably 0.04
to .66, and most preferably about 0.29.</p><p num="0035">A hydrosilylation catalyst is also required. Suitable
hydrosilylation catalysts are well-known, and widely available
from numerous sources. Preferred hydrosilylation catalysts are
platinum compounds such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents
3,159,601; 3,159,662; 3,220,972; 3,715,334; 3,775,452; and
3,814,730, and German published application DE 195 36176 A1,
preferably supplied in a solvent suitable for use in cosmetic
formulations, such as propanediol. Most preferred is Catalyst
OL, a divinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane platinum complex
diluted with polydimethylsiloxane, and available from Wacker
Silicones, Adrian, Michigan. Other solvents may be used as
well for dilution of the catalyst, provided that they are
cosmetically acceptable, or can be removed from the gel, for
example, by exposure to low pressures or stripping.</p><p num="0036">Applicants have discovered that the softness of
hydrosilylation-type gels may be maintained over time if a
minor, but effective amount of a hydrosilylation catalyst
inhibitor is added to the formulation, preferably after initial 
gelation. The catalyst inhibitors may be selected from all
hydrosilylation catalyst inhibitors available. However,
because the gels are intended for cosmetic formulations, some
inhibitors may not be advisable for toxicological reasons, or
for customer acceptance. For example, compounds such as
dodecanethiol should be avoided due to its odor. However, in
perfume-laden cosmetics, or where very small amounts are used,
even these inhibitors may be acceptable. The amount of
inhibitor generally ranges from about 0.001 to about 2 parts by
weight, preferably 0.01 part to 1 part by weight based on a
total gel weight of 100 parts. More preferably, 0.05 part to
0.5 part, and most preferably 0.1 part to 0.4 parts are used.
The amount is preferably sufficient such that no or only very
little noticeable increase in hardness occurs over a two week
period of storage at room temperature. While the inhibitors
are preferably added following gelation, or following the onset
of gelation, the inhibitor may be added at the same time or
even before catalyst addition. Additional catalyst may be
required in such cases.</p><p num="0037">The process employed to prepare the products of the present
invention may be varied. For example, the unsaturated silicone
resin and Si-H functional crosslinker may be first reacted,
followed by reaction of the unsaturated hydrocarbon; all
ingredients may be simultaneously reacted; or the unsaturated
hydrocarbon may be first reacted with the Si-H functional
crosslinker followed by reaction with the unsaturated silicone
resin. The latter process or a simultaneous reaction process
are preferred. Combinations of the above may be used as well.</p><p num="0038">In the case of the process where the unsaturated hydrocarbon is
first reacted with the Si-H functional crosslinker, this
reaction may take place neat or in the presence of the
oleaginous component. A lower reaction viscosity may aid in
completion of the reaction, but higher concentration of
unsaturated hydrocarbon per reaction volume may counter this 
trend. In either case, the reaction of unsaturated silicone
resin and Si-H functional crosslinker or partially reacted Si-H
functional crosslinker must take place in the presence of the
oleaginous component. Otherwise, the desired products will not
be obtained.</p><p num="0039">In a preferred embodiment, a process for the preparation of a
powder composition is provided. The process includes reacting
an unsaturated organopolysiloxane resin; an Si-H functional
organosiloxane crosslinker, at least 25 mol percent of said
crosslinker bearing pendant hydrido functionality and
containing minimally 5 Si-H groups; an unsaturated hydrocarbon
component containing minimally 6 carbon atoms, optionally
containing interspersed heteroatoms or heteroatom groups in a
ratio of carbon atoms in the backbone of the unsaturated
hydrocarbon moiety to heteroatoms of at least 4:1, or a
hydrocarbon moiety containing minimally 8 carbon atoms and
terminated by a carboxylic acid amide or carboxylic acid ester
group. One example of a hetero atom-containing unsaturated
hydrocarbon is a diamide or polyamide of an alkylene diamine, a
mono- or dicarboxylic acid or mixture thereof, and an
unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid. Such products
preferably contain no free carboxylic acid groups. Optionally,
an unsaturated hydrophile component, the mol ratio of
unsaturated hydrophile component to unsaturated hydrocarbon
component not exceeding 90:10, may also be present. The
reacting of the unsaturated organopolysiloxane resin and the
Si-H functional crosslinker takes place in minimally 20 weight
percent of liquid oleaginous component, in the presence of a
hydrosilylation catalyst, and the ratio of total moles of
unsaturated groups present to mol of Si-H bound hydrogen may be
from 0.11 to 2.5.</p><p num="0040">It is especially surprising that powdery gels can be produced
at high levels of oleoaginous liquid content. The gel powders
may be the immediate product of organopolysiloxane gel 
synthesis, or may be converted into powder form by milling, for
example in a three roll mill. The powders show a surprising
silky feel akin to the feeling one might envision from a
composition of microscopic ball bearings.</p><p num="0041">The powder products may be incorporated into formulated
products, for example cosmetics, by conventional methods. For
example, powder products can be converted to creamy gels by
agitation, either under high or low shear. Water, emollients,
humectants, colorants, viscosifiers, thixotropes, fillers,
etc., may be added. Some of these ingredients can be added
prior to formation of the powder, for example, additives which
contain few or no hydrosilatable unsaturated groups.</p><p num="0042">Following milling of the powder to a fine consistency, numerous
cosmetic ingredients can be added, such as perfumes,
emollients, lanolin, oils, pigments, U.V. absorbers, dyes, etc.
Thickeners such as pyrogenic silica and other ingredients may
also be added at this point to increase the viscosity of creams
to form paste-like products. A hydrophilic liquid may be added
prior to or after the addition of these other ingredients to
form the emulsions of the subject invention. Water and low
molecular weight organic hydrophilic liquids such as glycerine,
ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,
propylene glycol, and dipropylene glycol may also be used.</p><p num="0043">The number and type of cosmetic ingredients which may be added
is not overly critical, and can be easily selected by one
skilled in the art. In the application herein the term
"cosmetically acceptable ingredients" includes all ingredients
which can be added by a cosmetic formulator which are
cosmetically acceptable for use on the skin. Many such
ingredients are listed in standard references, for example
INTERNATIONAL COSMETIC INGREDIENT DICTIONARY AND HANDBOOK, ©1997, Cosmetic,
Toiletry and Fragrance Assoc., Washington, D.C. The
formulations may also be used in pharmaceutical formulations, 
for example in lotions, ointments, etc., or as a matrix or
reservoir component in transdermal drug delivery systems.</p><p num="0044">Suitable fillers include all those commonly employed. All or
part of the filler may be added prior to gelation; however, it
is highly preferred to form the gel or powder first and to add
filler with stirring to obtain a homogenous-appearing mixture.
Examples of fillers include fumed or pyrogenic silica,
precipitated silica, other silaceous fillers, and in particular
silaceous fillers having a BET surface area greater then 50
m<sup>2</sup>/g; metal silicates, particularly those containing metals of
Groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table; diatomaceous earth;
precipitated calcium carbonate; fuller's earth; clay minerals,
e.g., smectite clays, including bentonite, wollastonite, etc.;
kieselguhr; chalk; transparent iron oxides, and the like.
Those fillers which are colored can be simultaneously used as
pigments herein. Fillers may preferably be employed in amounts
of 0.05 to 40 weight percent, more preferably 0.1 to 25 weight
percent, and most preferably 0.5 to 10 weight percent. Fillers
of high surface area are generally used in lesser amounts than
low surface area fillers, due to the viscosity-increasing
effect of the former.</p><p num="0045">The powders and gels produced herein generally and preferably
have a % polysiloxane solids of from 15 to 35% burn rate of 0.5
in<sub>2</sub>/sec (powder), a flash point of 63°C (146°F) or higher
(gel), a specific gravity just under 1.0, for example between
0.92 and 0.98, a Brookfield viscosity ( spindle 6, 2.5 rpm) of
100,000 to 500,000 mPas, in the case of gels. Some gels may be
solids, i.e., powdery solids, or may have specific gravities
higher than 1.0, i.e., up to about 1.3. When hydrophilic
unsaturated hydrocarbons are used, the gels may exhibit water
compatibility (stable emulsion) of up to 80% by weight of water
based on total emulsion weight, preferably in the range of 20-40%,
and a propylene glycol compatibility (stability) of more
than 10%, preferably in the range of 20% to 90%. These figures 
refer to the amount of hydrophilic liquid, on a weight/weight
basis, which can be added and yet form a stable hydrophilic
liquid-containing emulsion.</p><p num="0046">The powders and gels of the subject invention may be used in
all cosmetic formulations where silicone emulsions and other
products have been used in the past, including, without
limitation, skin care products such as antiperspirants,
deodorants, sun care, after sun care, moisturizers, creams and
lotions; color cosmetic products, such as facial powder, eye
powder, eye shadow, liquid foundation, liquid-to-powder
