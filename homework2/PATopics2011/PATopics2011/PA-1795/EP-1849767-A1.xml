Other processes for the production of phosgene are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4764308A" status="new"><text>US 4764308</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO03072237A" status="new"><text>WO 03/072237</text></patcit>. On an industrial scale, phosgene is mainly produced by reacting carbon monoxide with chlorine, preferably on activated charcoal as catalyst. The highly exothermic gaseous phase reaction is carried out at temperatures of at least 250°C to at most 600°C, as a rule in shell-and-tube reactors. The heat of reaction may be dissipated in various ways, for example, by means of a liquid heat exchange medium, as described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO03072237A" status="new"><text>WO 03/072237</text></patcit>, or by hot cooling via a secondary cooling circuit with simultaneous utilization of the heat of reaction in order to generate steam, as disclosed, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4764308A" status="new"><text>US 4,764,308</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p num="p0004">In the amine phosgenation, unreacted phosgene mostly occurs at least in part in gaseous form together with the released hydrogen chloride. Phosgene and hydrogen chloride fractions still contained in the liquid isocyanate-carrying product stream are separated during the course of the isocyanate working-up stage. As a rule, this product stream can still contain fractions of solvent, inert gases, such as for example nitrogen and carbon monoxide, and secondary products of the phosgene synthesis, such as carbon dioxide and possibly entrained isocyanate. In order to operate the process for the production of isocyanates as economically as possible, it is essential to recover the excess phosgene with losses as small as possible and recycle it to the phosgenation process. It is also necessary to separate the stoichiometrically occurring hydrogen chloride gas and use it. Suitable uses for the hydrogen chloride are determined on the basis of the purity requirements on the hydrogen chloride for any given application.</p><p num="p0005">Possible uses for hydrogen chloride include marketing the aqueous solution (hydrochloric acid) or using hydrochloric acid in other industrial or chemical processes. One of the most common possible ways of using gaseous hydrogen chloride is for the oxychlorination of ethylene with hydrogen chloride to form ethylene dichloride. Recycling processes for the hydrogen chloride and the return of the chlorine and/or hydrogen to the production process in which the hydrogen chloride is formed are also among the preferred procedures. These recycling processes include the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen chloride, for example according to the Deacon process, the electrolysis of gaseous hydrogen chloride, as well as the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid). <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO0414845A"  status="new"><text>WO-A-04/14845</text></patcit> discloses a process for the catalytic oxidation according to the Deacon process, and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO9724320A" status="new"><text>WO-A-97/24320</text></patcit> discloses a process for the gas phase electrolysis of hydrogen chloride.

In the electrolysis, chlorine is produced at the anode and hydrogen is produced at the cathode.</p><p num="p0008">The aforementioned possibilities of using hydrogen chloride impose certain purity requirements and thus involve expenditure and equipment on purification after separating the majority of the other components in the gaseous stream containing phosgene and hydrogen chloride. The catalytic hydrogen chloride oxidation by the Deacon process is carried out with a catalyst that requires the preliminary purification of the hydrogen chloride gas from a phosgenation process by means of absorption on a purification bed, or the catalytic combustion of solvent residues contained in the hydrogen chloride (<patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="WO04014845A" status="new"><text>WO-A-04/014845</text></patcit>).

In the electrochemical oxidation of an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride using a gas diffusion electrode as cathode, it is suggested in <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="WO0218675A" status="new"><text>WO-A-02/18675</text></patcit> that the hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) be purified by means of activated charcoal and, if necessary, additionally by means of an ion exchange resin. For the use of hydrogen chloride gas in oxychlorination, a two-stage condensation may be used to separate interfering impurities, such as solvent residues (<patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US6719957A" status="new"><text>US-A-6,719, 957</text></patcit>).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p num="p0009">An aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) for use in the foodstuffs industry must have a correspondingly high degree of purity, which can be achieved by an adsorptive post-purification on a bed of activated charcoal, as known from the prior art.</p><p num="p0010">The treatment of the phosgene-containing and hydrogen chloride-containing substance streams from the isocyanate production according to the prior art is described hereinafter.</p><p num="p0011">The general aim is to isolate the substance streams containing phosgene and hydrogen chloride with secondary components contained therein, such as solvent, in the required purity as economically as possible in order to be able to reuse phosgene in the amine phosgenation and pass the hydrogen chloride to a suitable utilization stage. The processes of condensation, partial condensation, washing/scrubbing, absorption, adsorption and distillation are normally employed for this purpose.</p><p num="p0012">A partial condensation of phosgene from the process gas may be achieved under high pressure, for example at a pressure between 10 and 50 bar, in an energy-efficient manner by means of cooling water, though for exploitation on an industrial scale the stringent safety measures as regards a leakage involving escape of phosgene have to be taken into account, as described in <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="DE3212510A" status="new"><text>DE-A-3212510</text></patcit>.</p><p num="p0013">The phosgenation reaction and working-up of the gas phase under elevated pressure is also described in <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US3544611A" status="new"><text>US-A-3,544,611</text></patcit>. In a pressure range of from 10 to 50 bar, the process gas is cooled with water in order to condense a large part of the phosgene that is used in stoichiometric excess. A further depletion of phosgene in the hydrogen chloride stream requires the use of cooling agents. In this case, the economic advantage of the amine phosgenation with working-up of the process gas at elevated pressure is also reflected in the saving of energy for cooling the phosgene condensation. An alternative is described in <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="US3544611A" status="new"><text>US-A-3,544,611</text></patcit> in which<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> hydrogen chloride is condensed from the process gas stream at 33 bar and at a coolant temperature of -20°C. In this case, phosgene is condensed by cooling with water and separating in a preliminary stage. The respective purities required of the two components is achieved by a distillation/stripping column between the two condensation stages.</p><p num="p0014">In <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="DE10260084A" status="new"><text>DE-A-10260084</text></patcit> reference is made to <patcit id="pcit0017" dnum="US3544611A" status="new"><text>US-A-3544611</text></patcit> in connection with an increased potential hazard in the event of a leakage due to this pressurized procedure. It is also noted that in the described processes there is an undesirably high concentration of hydrogen chloride in the phosgene used for the phosgenation, and phosgene is also lost with the hydrogen chloride stream (first variant). In the second variant, apart from the comments on the already-mentioned potential hazard, reference is also made to the energetically unfavorable hydrogen chloride liquefaction at low temperatures and high pressures. For further utilization, the hydrogen chloride must then be evaporated, which again uses energy.</p><p num="p0015">In the process disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0018" dnum="GB827376A" status="new"><text>GB-A-827376</text></patcit>, an amine phosgenation is carried out at a pressure of ca. 3 bar. After completion of the reaction, excess phosgene and hydrogen chloride that are formed are separated overhead in a column at elevated temperature. Phosgene is condensed out from the gaseous phase, and the hydrogen chloride is flashed (expanded) and removed. However, high residual amounts of phosgene in the hydrogen chloride as well as undesirably high hydrogen chloride contents in the recovered phosgene can be expected with such a simple separation.</p><p num="p0016">Amine phosgenation in chlorobenzene to form TDI and MDI is described in <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="US33812025A" status="new"><text>US-A-3,3812,025</text></patcit>. After completion of the reaction, solvent together with phosgene and hydrogen chloride are distilled off, chlorobenzene and phosgene are then condensed and recycled to the phosgenation, and hydrogen chloride containing<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> considerable residual amounts of phosgene is passed through an absorber to eliminate the phosgene. In this case too the phosgene/hydrogen chloride separation is incomplete in both streams, so that phosgene losses occur through hydrogen chloride and undesirably high hydrogen chloride fractions are contained in the phosgene, which promote a disadvantageous amine hydrochloride formation in the phosgenation.</p><p num="p0017">The amine phosgenation to isocyanate combined with working-up disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="SU1811161A" status="new"><text>SU-A-1811161</text></patcit> is described in <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="DE10260084A" status="new"><text>DE-A-10260084</text></patcit>. In <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="DE10260084A" status="new"><text>DE-A-10260084</text></patcit>, it is also reported that phosgene is absorbed in gaseous form in the solvent chlorobenzene without prior condensation. After the phosgenation reaction, hydrogen chloride, phosgene and to some extent solvent are separated as gaseous phase. After partial condensation, the gaseous phase is passed to an absorber, the liquid phase is led into a stripping column in which hydrogen chloride and phosgene are separated overhead, and is partially condensed and likewise passed to the absorber. A solution of ca. 70 wt.% of phosgene in chlorobenzene is formed in the absorber. The gaseous hydrogen chloride stream from the absorber head still contains ca. 4% of phosgene and is passed to a further treatment stage. According to <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="DE10260084A" status="new"><text>DE-A-10260084</text></patcit>, the solution of phosgene in chlorobenzene also still contains relatively large amounts of hydrogen chloride due to the chlorobenzene wash at low temperature. According to the details given in <patcit id="pcit0024" dnum="DE10260084A" status="new"><text>DE-A-10260084</text></patcit>, hydrogen chloride and phosgene after their separation are still mutually contaminated to such an extent that, as already described, hydrogen chloride cannot be passed without further working-up to one of the conventional utilization stages and the phosgene solution that is obtained is uneconomical for the phosgenation process.</p><p num="p0018">In <patcit id="pcit0025" dnum="EP0570799A" status="new"><text>EP-A-0570799</text></patcit>, which is a publication relating to amine phosgenation in the gaseous phase, reference is made to the separation in a manner known <i>per se</i> of excess phosgene after condensation of the isocyanate that is formed. This may be achieved by means of a cold trap, absorption in an inert solvent (e.g.,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene) maintained at a temperature of -10°C to 8°C, or by adsorption and hydrolysis on activated charcoal. The last variant does not appear economically feasible for large-scale implementation. The hydrogen chloride gas passing through the phosgene recovery stage can be recycled in a manner known <i>per se</i> to recover the chlorine required for the phosgene synthesis.</p><p num="p0019">A continuous two-stage amine phosgenation process in the liquid phase is described in <patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="US3226410A" status="new"><text>US-A-3,226,410</text></patcit>. A phosgene solution is admixed in a stoichiometric excess of an amine solution in a tubular reactor at temperatures of up to 90°C.

The second stage takes place in a boiler at 110° to 135°C. The gaseous phase, composed of phosgene, hydrogen chloride and solvent fractions, is removed overhead from the second stage, condensed in a two-stage process, and passed to the phosgene solution vessel. Non-condensable fractions pass into an absorption column, where phosgene still contained in the gas stream is absorbed by means of distilled-off solvent from the liquid phase of the phosgenation and is passed to the phosgene solution vessel. Non-absorbed fractions from the absorption column which for the most part are hydrogen chloride gas, are fed to an HCl absorber operated with water, in which aqueous hydrochloric acid is formed.</p><p num="p0020">Apart from the isocyanate production, a phosgene/hydrogen chloride separation is also necessary in the phosgenation of alcohols to form chloroformates. In accordance with the process disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0027" dnum="DE69820078A" status="new"><text>DE-A-69820078</text></patcit>, this takes place at high pressures in a column connected downstream of the reactor. The reactor pressure ranges from 2 to 60 bar, preferably 6 to 40 bar.

The first process step is the partial condensation of the process gas, which can take place in one or more stages, wherein depending on the equipment pressure, the procedure may be operated between 40°C by means of cooling water and -40°C with brine cooling. The partially condensed mixture thereby obtained is then passed, between the stripping section and the rectifying section, to the following distillation column. In the given example, using chlorobenzene as solvent, this column is designed as a bubble-cap column with 22 trays in the stripping section and 11 trays in the rectifying section. The column serves to remove hydrogen chloride from the phosgene and is equipped for this purpose with a forced circulation evaporator (Robert evaporator) and a shell-and-tube heat exchanger as head condenser.

The hydrogen chloride gas can subsequently be freed from residual amounts of phosgene or solvent by partial condensation in a heat exchanger at low temperatures.

In the gaseous phase, the reaction preferably takes place in the absence of an organic solvent. The term solvent is understood in this connection to mean organic solvents such as o-dichlorobenzene, but not however inert gases such as nitrogen or materials that boil at low temperatures, such as chloroform. The inert gases are hereinafter<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> referred to as inert substances, and the materials boiling at low temperatures (e.g., chloroform) are referred to as low-boiling compounds.</p><p num="p0033">If the reaction of amine and phosgene in step a) is carried out in the liquid phase in the presence of a solvent, then as absorption agent for the isothermal absorption and for the adiabatic absorption there is preferably used the solvent that is also employed as solvent in the phosgenation in step a). The liquid phosgene stream obtained in step c) then preferably contains, apart from the solvent, also 20 to 80 wt.% of phosgene, based on the weight of the liquid phosgene stream (i.e. the mixture). This liquid phosgene stream containing solvent and phosgene can then be recycled to the reaction in step a), preferably without prior desorption of phosgene.</p><p num="p0034">If the reaction of amine and phosgene in step a) is carried out in the gaseous phase, then in step c) a liquid phosgene stream is likewise obtained, preferably containing, apart from the solvent used as absorption agent, also 20 to 80 wt.% of phosgene, based on the weight of the liquid phosgene stream (i.e. the mixture). Phosgene is then separated, preferably by desorption, from this liquid phosgene stream and returned to the reaction in step a). The separated solvent (absorption agent) can be re-used in the absorption.</p><p num="p0035">Preferably, the separation of the stream containing hydrogen chloride, phosgene and optionally solvent, low-boiling compounds and inert substances in step b) is carried out in such a way that first of all phosgene is partially condensed out from the stream containing hydrogen chloride, phosgene and optionally solvent, low-boiling compounds and inert substances.

Absorption is a thermal separation process in which an auxiliary substance, the so-called wash, solution or absorption agent, is employed. The absorbate can be regenerated by desorption or stripping. The uptake of gas in the solvent (absorption agent) is generally promoted by low temperatures and high pressures, and conversely higher temperatures and lower pressures should be used in desorption. The absorption of gases in solvents (absorption agents) is an exothermic process, i.e. heat is released, which on account of the relatively poor heat transmission is transferred only to a slight extent to the gaseous phase and is mainly transferred to the liquid phase. The<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> result of raising the temperature of the solvent (absorption agent) is, according to Henry's Law, a reduction in the absorption capacity of the solvent (absorption agent) for the substance to be dissolved. In an industrial process this at the same time means a higher solvent demand for a constant amount of absorbate. If the heat of absorption is not dissipated or is dissipated only after absorption has taken place, one speaks of adiabatic absorption. If the heat of absorption is removed uniformly during the absorption and the temperature of the solvent is at the same time maintained substantially constant, one speaks of isothermal absorption, which in practice is preferred on account of the better utilization of the solvent (absorption agent), as already described.</p><p num="p0041">Preferably the adiabatic absorption takes place in fresh solvent (as absorption agent), which corresponds to the solvent used in step a). In the process according to the invention, it has been shown to be particularly advantageous to absorb the major part of the phosgene contained in the stream containing hydrogen chloride, phosgene and optionally solvent, low-boiling compounds and inert substances, optionally after partial condensation, by means of an isothermal counter-current absorption in as little solvent (absorption agent) as possible, and then to remove the still remaining residual amounts of phosgene by means of adiabatic counter-current absorption with fresh solvent (absorption agent) with only a slight adiabatic temperature rise. The optimal outflow concentration of phosgene in the vapor stream obtained from the isothermal absorption (stream containing hydrogen chloride, phosgene and optionally solvent, low-boiling compounds and inert substances) is governed in this connection by the amount of solvent (amount of absorption agent) in the adiabatic absorption and the adiabatic temperature rise that can be tolerated having regard to the absorption capacity of the solvent (absorption agent) during the course of the adiabatic absorption. Adiabatic temperature rises of from 0.1° to 20°C, preferably from 2° to 5°C have proven to be expedient in this case.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p><p num="p0042">In this connection, weight ratios of solvent to phosgene at the entry point to the isothermal absorption are preferably adjusted to from 0.1:1 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:1 to 3:1. The solvent used for the isothermal absorption may in this connection be added either completely or also in part already at the head of the adiabatic absorption.</p><p num="p0043">The production of isocyanates by reacting amine with phosgene, the so-called phosgenation, takes place on an industrial scale normally in the liquid phase, wherein the phosgene and the amine can be dissolved in a solvent. Preferred solvents are: chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, for example chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, p-dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzenes, the corresponding chlorotoluenes or chloroxylenes, chloroethylbenzene, monochlorodiphenyl, α-and β-naphthyl chloride, ethyl benzoate, dialkyl esters of phthalic acid, diisodiethyl phthalate, toluene and xylenes, as well as methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, trichlorofluoromethane and butyl acetate. Mixtures of the solvents mentioned by way of example may also be used. Further examples of suitable solvents are known from the prior art. As is also known from the prior art, e.g. <patcit id="pcit0035" dnum="WO9616028A" status="new"><text>WO-A-96/16028</text></patcit>, phosgene as well as the formed isocyanate itself can act as solvent. In another, preferred embodiment, the phosgenation, in particular of suitable aromatic and aliphatic diamines, takes place in the gaseous phase, i.e. above the boiling point of the amine. Gas phase phosgenation is described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0036" dnum="EP570799A" status="new"><text>EP-A-570 799</text></patcit>. Advantages of this process compared to the otherwise conventional liquid phase phosgenation are the saving in energy, due to the minimization of a costly solvent and phosgene circulation. As a rule, solvent is also used in gas phase phosgenation, but in smaller amounts than in liquid phase phosgenation, as described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0037" dnum="DE10245704A" status="new"><text>DE-A-10245704</text></patcit>, so that here too in principle the object is to separate phosgene, hydrogen chloride and solvent.</p><p num="p0044">Suitable organic amines are in principle all primary amines containing one or more primary amino groups that can react with phosgene to form one or more<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> isocyanates containing one or more isocyanate groups. The amines contain at least one, preferably two or possibly three or more primary amino groups.

Suitable organic primary amines include aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aliphatic/aromatic, aromatic amines, diamines and/or polyamines, such as methylamine, ethylamine, butylamine, stearylamine, aniline, halogen-substituted phenylamines (e.g., 4-chlorophenylamine), 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 1,8-diamino-hexane, 1-amino-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-aminocyclohexane, lysine ethyl ester, lysine aminoethyl ester, 1,6,11-triaminoundecane or 1,5-naphthylenediamine, 1,4-diaminobenzene, p-xylylenediamine, perhydrogenated 2,4- and/or 2,6-diaminotoluene, 2,2'-, 2,4'-and/or 4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, 2,4-, 2,6-diaminotoluene and their mixtures, 4,4'-, 2,4'- and/or 2,2'-diphenylmethanediamine and their mixtures, as well as higher molecular weight isomeric, oligomeric or polymeric derivatives of these amines and polyamines. Other possible amines are known from the prior art. Preferred amines for the present invention are the diamines and polyamines of the diphenylmethane series (MDA, monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric amines), 2,4-, 2,6-diaminotoluene (TDA, toluylenediamines), for example technical mixtures of 2,4-, 2,6-diaminotoluene (TDA, toluylenediamines) in a weight ratio of 80:20, isophorone diamine and hexamethylenediamine. The corresponding isocyanates diisocyanatodiphenylmethane (MDI, monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric isocyanates), toluene diisocyanate (TDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) are obtained in the phosgenation.</p><p num="p0045">The amines can be reacted with phosgene in a one-stage, two-stage or possibly multistage reaction. At the same time, a continuous or batchwise mode of operation is possible.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p num="p0046">If a one-stage phosgenation in the gaseous phase is chosen, then the reaction takes place above the boiling point of the amine, preferably within a mean contact time of from 0.5 to 5 seconds and at temperatures of from 200° to 600°C.</p><p num="p0047">In phosgenation in the liquid phase, temperatures of from 20° to 240°C and pressures of from 1 to ca. 50 bar absolute are normally used. Phosgenation in the liquid phase may be carried out as a one-stage or multistage process, in which phosgene can be used in stoichiometric excess. The amine solution and the phosgene solution are combined preferably using a static mixing element and are then fed, for example, from below upwardly through one or more reaction towers, where the mixture reacts completely to form the desired isocyanate. In addition to reaction towers that are provided with suitable mixing elements, reaction vessels equipped with a stirring device may also be used. Static mixing elements or special dynamic mixing elements may be employed. Suitable static and dynamic mixing elements are known from the prior art.</p><p num="p0048">As a rule, the continuous liquid phase production of isocyanates on an industrial scale is carried out in two stages. In the first stage which is generally conducted at temperatures of at most 220°C, preferably at most 160°C, carbamoyl chloride is formed from amine and phosgene and amine hydrochloride is formed from amine and hydrogen chloride that has split off. This first stage is highly exothermic. In the second stage, the carbamoyl chloride is cleaved to form isocyanate and hydrogen chloride and the amine hydrochloride is reacted to form carbamoyl chloride. The second stage is generally carried out at temperatures of at least 90°C, preferably from 100° to 240°C.</p><p num="p0049">After the amine phosgenation, the isocyanates formed in the phosgenation are generally separated from the reaction mixture. This is carried out, for example, by first separating the phosgenation reaction mixture into a liquid product stream and a gaseous product stream in a manner known to the person skilled in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p num="p0050">Relevant processes are described, for example, in <patcit id="pcit0038" dnum="US3544611A" status="new"><text>US-A-3544611</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0039" dnum="GB827376A" status="new"><text>GB-A-827376</text></patcit>. The liquid product stream contains essentially the isocyanate or isocyanate mixture, solvent that may have been used, as well as a small proportion of unreacted phosgene. The gaseous product stream is composed substantially of hydrogen chloride gas, excess phosgene, possibly minor amounts of solvent, as well as secondary products from the phosgene production, such as carbon dioxide. The further working-up of the liquid product stream may result in a further separation of residual amounts of phosgene.</p><p num="p0051">As complete a recovery of excess phosgene as possible for re-use in the phosgenation as well as the isolation of hydrogen chloride that is as pure as possible for further utilization is therefore desired, particularly for economic reasons.</p><p num="p0052">The stream containing hydrogen chloride, phosgene and optionally solvent, low-boiling compounds and inert substances, which normally occurs in the reaction of aliphatic or aromatic amines with phosgene in the liquid phase to form the corresponding isocyanates in step a), preferably contains from 20 to 75 wt.% of phosgene, from 5 to 50 wt.% of solvent and from 5 to 50 wt.% of hydrogen chloride. The breadth of these ranges for the composition of the stream containing hydrogen chloride, phosgene and optionally solvent, low-boiling compounds and inert substances is due to the number of different possible processes for the phosgenation which are characterised by different pressures, temperatures and process solvents, and that can optionally take place in the gaseous phase or free of solvent.</p><p num="p0053">The stream containing hydrogen chloride, phosgene and optionally solvent, low-boiling compounds and inert substances, which normally occurs in the reaction of aliphatic or aromatic amines with phosgene in the gaseous phase to form the corresponding isocyanates in step a), preferably contains from 20 to 50 wt.% of<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> solvent, from 30 to 40 wt.% of phosgene, from 10 to 50 wt.% of hydrogen chloride and less than 1 wt.% of low-boiling compounds and inert substances.</p><p num="p0054">The heat of absorption produced in the isothermal absorption of the phosgene in the wash liquid is dissipated indirectly via a heat exchange surface uniformly and already during its production to a suitable cooling medium with an initial temperature of preferably -40° to 0°C, most preferably -25° to -15°C, whereby the temperature of the absorption agent is maintained constant at a correspondingly low value. In this way it is possible, despite the unfavorable temperature dependence of the distribution coefficient on the absorbate in the absorbent, to achieve a high phosgene dissolution capacity of the absorption agent and thereby a particularly economical demand for absorption agent.</p><p num="p0055">The isothermal absorption is preferably carried out in the process according to the invention with a falling film absorber as apparatus (e.g., as illustrated in Fig. 1). Shell-and-tube heat exchangers, preferably vertically arranged, single flight shell-and-tube heat exchangers are normally used for this purpose. The absorption agent and the charged vapors may be led both inside as well as outside the tubes, in co-current or counter-current to the cooling medium, which is correspondingly situated on the other side of the tube wall. The absorption agent and the charged vapors are, however, preferably guided within the tubes in counter-current and the coolant is preferably guided outside the tubes.
