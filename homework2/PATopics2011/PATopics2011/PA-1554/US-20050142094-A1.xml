In some particularly preferred embodiments, the present invention provides personal care compositions comprising an effective amount of at least one fragment of a repeat sequence protein polymer having bioactivity. </p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0004"> Proteins have been widely used as ingredients in personal care products, pigment coating, and in bandages to promote wound healing. Use of silk proteins to perform a variety of functions and to impart desired characteristics to product formulations has been described (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,015; Japanese Patent No. 27186; and Japanese Patent No. 309816). In these disclosures, silk protein hydrolysates were used because of the low solubility of intact silk proteins. For example, for these reasons, proteins have been used to impart some beneficial coating effects such as manageability and strength to hair, to moisturize skin and hair, and to provide film formation to improve the appearance of skin and hair. Proteins have also been used to provide durability properties-to many personal care products. </p><p num="p-0005"> However, such proteins may not exhibit all desired characteristics when used in personal care products. For example, natural silk proteins may impart durability but may also form tight, hard fibers that are not suitable for film formation. Also, many natural proteins have a low isoelectric point, which reduces the affinity of the protein for the negatively charged skin and hair. Additionally, when more than one protein is needed to impart all desired characteristics to a given formulation, the necessity of using more than one protein may increase the cost and production time for a given personal care product. </p><p num="p-0006"> Furthermore, proteins generally have poor solubility due to high molecular weight and hydrophobicity. Commercially available proteins, including structural proteins such as silk and collagen, are typically chemically degraded giving a diverse mixture of molecular weight fragments with variable properties (See e.g., German Patent No. 3139438 ; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,280,747). However, in most embodiments, hydrolyzed proteins have not been found to be as effective as the intact proteins, as the beneficial effects of the self-assembly, nanofibrilation and coating properties have not realized. As such, these proteins are often modified chemically (See e.g.,. U.S. Pat. No. 6,296,860) to enhance solubility for inclusion in personal care products and coating pigments for personal care use (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,741). However, even chemically modified proteins may not have all desired characteristics. </p><p num="p-0007"> In addition, in the wound care area, enzymatically digested silk protein has been described as being useful as a healing promoter in wound dressings (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,431). However, digested silk protein is not as effective as water-soluble silk protein (See e.g., WO 04/044172). U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,053 describes the use of dissolved silk proteins as a wound dressing material. However, these preparations required harsh solvents to dissolve the silk protein prior to use. </p><p num="p-0008"> Thus, there remains a need in the art for personal care compositions that have desired characteristics without undesirable chemical modification of the proteins. There also remains a need in the art for a method of delivering a protein into a personal care composition so as to effectively deliver the protein in a useable form. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0009"> The present invention provides to personal care compositions, and more particularly, personal care compositions comprising a bioactively effective amount of a repeat sequence protein polymer.

In some embodiments, the copolymers are combinations of silk units and elastin units, which provides silk-elastin copolymers having properties distinctive from polymers having only the same monomeric unit. </p><p num="p-0043"> A “variant” of an RSPP (e.g., SELP) as used herein, refers to an amino acid sequence that is altered by one or more amino acids. The variant may have “conservative” changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, (e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine). More rarely, a variant may have “nonconservative” changes (e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan). Similar minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. In addition to the teaching herein, guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted, or deleted without abolishing bioactivity may be found using computer programs well known in the art, for example, DNASTAR software. </p><p num="p-0044"> The term “wild-type” refers to a gene or gene product which has the characteristics of that gene or gene product when isolated from a naturally occurring source. A wild-type gene is that which is most frequently observed in a population and is thus arbitrarily designed the “normal” or “wild-type” form of the gene. In contrast, the term “modified” or “mutant” refers to a gene or gene product which displays modifications in sequence and or functional properties (i.e., altered characteristics) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally-occurring mutants can be isolated; these are identified by the fact that they have altered characteristics when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. </p><p num="p-0045"> The term “gene” refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor. The polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties of the full-length or fragment are retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the including sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5′ and 3′ ends for a distance of about 1 kb on either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA. The sequences which are located 5′ of the coding region and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 5′ non-translated sequences. The sequences which are located 3′ or downstream of the coding region and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 3′ non-translated sequences. The term “gene” encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed “introns” or “intervening regions” or “intervening sequences.” Introns are segments of a gene which are transcribed into nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or “spliced out” from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent polypeptide. In addition to containing introns, genomic forms of a gene may also include sequences located on both the 5′ and 3′ end of the sequences which are present on the RNA transcript. These sequences are referred to as “flanking” sequences or regions (these flanking sequences are located 5′ or 3′ to the non-translated sequences present on the mRNA transcript). The 5′ flanking region may contain regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers which control or influence the transcription of the gene. The 3′ flanking region may contain sequences which direct the termination of transcription, post-transcriptional cleavage and polyadenylation. </p><p num="p-0046"> As used herein, the term “amino acid sequence” refers to an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring protein molecule. “Amino acid sequence” and like terms, such as “polypeptide” and “protein” are not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete, native amino acid sequence associated with the recited protein molecule. </p><p num="p-0047"> As used herein, the terms “nucleic acid molecule encoding,” “DNA sequence encoding,” and “DNA encoding” refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA sequence thus encodes the amino acid sequence. </p><p num="p-0048"> DNA molecules are said to have “5′ ends” and “3′ ends” because mononucleotides are reacted to make oligonucleotides or polynucleotides in a manner such that the 5′ phosphate of one mononucleotide pentose ring is attached to the 3′ oxygen of its neighbor in one direction via a phosphodiester linkage. Therefore, an end of an oligonucleotides or polynucleotide, referred to as the “5′ end” if its 5′ phosphate is not linked to the 3′ oxygen of a mononucleotide pentose ring and as the “3′ end” if its 3′ oxygen is not linked to a 5′ phosphate of a subsequent mononucleotide pentose ring. As used herein, a nucleic acid sequence, even if internal to a larger oligonucleotide or polynucleotide, also may be said to have 5′ and 3′ ends. In either a linear or circular DNA molecule, discrete elements are referred to as being “upstream” or 5′ of the “downstream” or 3′ elements. This terminology reflects the fact that transcription proceeds in a 5′ to 3′ fashion along the DNA strand. The promoter and enhancer elements which direct transcription of a linked gene are generally located 5′ or upstream of the coding region However, enhancer elements can exert their effect even when located 3′ of the promoter element and the coding region. Transcription termination and polyadenylation signals are located 3′ or downstream of the coding region. </p><p num="p-0049"> As used herein, the terms “an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene” and “polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene,” refer to a nucleic acid sequence comprising the coding region of a gene (i.e., the nucleic acid sequence which encodes a gene product). The coding region may be present in either a cDNA, genomic DNA or RNA form. When present in a DNA form, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be single-stranded (i.e., the sense strand) or double-stranded. Suitable control elements such as enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, polyadenylation signals, etc. may be placed in close proximity to the coding region of the gene if needed to permit proper initiation of transcription and/or correct processing of the primary RNA transcript. Alternatively, the coding region utilized in the expression vectors of the present invention may contain endogenous enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, intervening sequences, polyadenylation signals, etc. or a combination of both endogenous and exogenous control elements. </p><p num="p-0050"> As used herein, the term “regulatory element” refers to a genetic element which controls some aspect of the expression of nucleic acid sequences. For example, a promoter is a regulatory element which facilitates the initiation of transcription of an operably linked coding region. Other regulatory elements are splicing signals, polyadenylation signals, termination signals, etc. (defined infra). </p><p num="p-0051"> As used herein, the terms “complementary” or “complementarity” are used in reference to polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing rules. For example, for the sequence “A-G-T,” is complementary to the sequence “T-C-A.” Complementarity may be “partial,” in which only some of the nucleic acids′ bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be “complete” or “total” complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods which depend upon binding between nucleic acids. </p><p num="p-0052"> As used herein, the term “homology” refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid is referred to using the functional term “substantially homologous.” The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target. </p><p num="p-0053"> The art knows well that numerous equivalent conditions may be employed to comprise low stringency conditions; factors such as the length and nature (DNA, RNA, base composition) of the probe and nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition, present in solution or immobilized, etc.) and the concentration of the salts and other components (e.g., the presence or absence of formamide, dextran sulfate, polyethylene glycol) are considered and the hybridization solution may be varied to generate conditions of low stringency hybridization different from, but equivalent to, the above listed conditions. In addition, the art knows conditions which promote hybridization under conditions of high stringency (e.g., increasing the temperature of the hybridization and/or wash steps, the use of formamide in the hybridization solution, etc.). </p><p num="p-0054"> When used in reference to a double-stranded nucleic acid sequence such as a cDNA or genomic clone, the term “substantially homologous” refers to any probe which can hybridize to either or both strands of the double-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above. </p><p num="p-0055"> When used in reference to a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, the term “substantially homologous” refers to any probe which can hybridize (i.e., it is the complement of) the single-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above. </p><p num="p-0056"> As used herein, the term “hybridization” is used in reference to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, the Tm of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids. </p><p num="p-0057"> As used herein, the term “T<sub>m</sub>” is used in reference to the “melting temperature.” The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for calculating the T<sub>m </sub>of nucleic acids is well known in the art. As indicated by standard references, a simple estimate of the T<sub>m </sub>value may be calculated by the equation: T<sub>m</sub>=81.5+0.41(% G+C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (See e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in <i>Nucleic Acid Hybridization [</i>1985]). Other references include more sophisticated computations which take structural as well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of T<sub>m</sub>. </p><p num="p-0058"> As used herein the term “stringency” is used in reference to the conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds such as organic solvents, under which nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. With “high stringency” conditions, nucleic acid base pairing will occur only between nucleic acid fragments that have a high frequency of complementary base sequences. Thus, conditions of “weak” or “low” stringency are often required with nucleic acids that are derived from organisms that are genetically diverse, as the frequency of complementary sequences is usually less. </p><p num="p-0059"> “Amplification” is a special case of nucleic acid replication involving template specificity. It is to be contrasted with non-specific template replication (i.e., replication that is template-dependent but not dependent on a specific template). Template specificity is here distinguished from fidelity of replication (i.e., synthesis of the proper polynucleotide sequence) and nucleotide (ribo- or deoxyribo-) specificity. Template specificity is frequently described in terms of “target” specificity. Target sequences are “targets” in the sense that they are sought to be sorted out from other nucleic acid. Amplification techniques have been designed primarily for this sorting out. </p><p num="p-0060"> As used herein, the terms “restriction endonucleases” and “restriction enzymes” refer to bacterial enzymes, each of which cut double-stranded DNA at or near a specific nucleotide sequence. </p><p num="p-0061"> As used herein, the term “recombinant DNA molecule” as used herein refers to a DNA molecule which is comprised of segments of DNA joined together by means of molecular biological techniques. </p><p num="p-0062"> The terms “in operable combination,” “in operable order,” and “operably linked” as used herein refer to the linkage of nucleic acid sequences in such a manner that a nucleic acid molecule capable of directing the transcription of a given gene and/or the synthesis of a desired protein molecule is produced. The term also refers to the linkage of amino acid sequences in such a manner so that a functional protein is produced. </p><p num="p-0063"> As used herein, the term “isolated” when used in relation to a nucleic acid, as in “an isolated oligonucleotide” or “isolated polynucleotide” refers to a nucleic acid sequence that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid with which it is ordinarily associated in its natural source. Isolated nucleic acid is such present in a form or setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. In contrast, non-isolated nucleic acids as nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA found in the state they exist in nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes; RNA sequences, such as a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein, are found in the cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNA s which encode a multitude of proteins. The isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide, or polynucleotide may be present in single-stranded or double-stranded form. When an isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is to be utilized to express a protein, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide will contain at a minimum the sense or coding strand (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may single-stranded), but may contain both the sense and anti-sense strands (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be double-stranded). </p><p num="p-0064"> As used herein, the term “purified” or “to purify” refers to the removal of contaminants from a sample. </p><p num="p-0065"> A compound is said to be “in a form suitable for administration” when the compound may be administered to a human or other animal by any desired route (e.g., topical, oral, etc.). A “composition comprising a given polynucleotide sequence” as used herein refers broadly to any composition containing the given polynucleotide sequence. The composition may comprise an aqueous solution.

Thus, cosmetics are defined by their intended use, as articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering appearance. These compositions provide non-therapeutic benefits and are not regulated as pharmaceuticals. However, in some situations, cosmetic compositions are incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions to provide cosmetic benefits (e.g., products that treat skin or hair diseases, but also contain cosmetic compositions for their coloring or other benefits). Also, it is intended that the present invention encompass the use of cosmetics on animals other than humans. </p><p num="p-0070"> As used herein, the terms “pharmaceutical compositions” and “therapeutic compositions” refer to compositions such as drugs that provide medical benefits, rather than solely cosmetic benefits.

For example, the repeat sequence protein polymer may be produced by generally recognized methods of chemical synthesis (See e.g., Andersson et. al., Biopolymers 55:227-50 [2000]); genetic manipulation (See e.g., Cappello, <i>Genetically Engineered Protein Polymers, </i>In <i>Handbook of Biodegradable Polymers, </i>Domb et al.

In some particularly preferred embodiments, the repeat sequence protein polymers are produced on a commercial scale. </p><p num="p-0088"> In some embodiments, the repeating amino acid sequence units comprise identical repeating sequence units, while in other embodiments, they comprise different repeating sequence unit combinations, which join together to form a block copolymer or an alternating block copolymer. Additionally, in some embodiments, the individual repeating amino acid sequence units of the repeat sequence protein polymer comprise from about 3 to about 30 amino acids. In other embodiments, the individual repeating units comprise from about 3 to about 8 amino acids. Moreover, the same amino acid may appear at least twice in the same repeating sequence unit. Thus, it is not intended that the amino acids be limited as to the number of repeats in each repeating sequence unit. </p><p num="p-0089"> Repeat sequence protein polymers utilizing natural and/or synthetic repeating sequence units are produced to provide various desirable characteristics. One skilled in the art appreciates the various desirable characteristics for repeat sequence protein polymers, any of which may be employed herein. The characteristics may include, for example, moisturizing properties, adhesion, contraction, entrapment, high glass transition temperature for hardness or strength, a high cloud temperature for heat sensitive applications, and/or a high isoelectric point to increase the affinity of the protein to hair, skin, and nails, etc. Self-assembly and nanofilament formation properties find use in skin anti-wrinkle and fine line filling applications. Additionally, in some embodiments, a protein having a particular molecular weight is chosen in order to increase or decrease water solubility and/or other properties as desired. </p><p num="p-0090"> Furthermore, repeat sequence protein polymers are advantageous in providing personal care products when modified with desired chemical agents. RSPPs provide amino, hydroxyl and/or carboxyl functional groups that can be covalently reacted, conjugated, composited or ionically bonded with various personal care chemical and formulating functional ingredients. In various embodiments, these include: UV absorbers (e.g., octyl methoxycinnamate, benzophenone-3, titanium dioxide, and octyl salicylate); film-forming agents (e.g., VP/Eicosene copolymer); cosmeceutical agents (e.g., peptides and proteins, alpha hydroxy acids, and retinol and retinoic acid derivatives); antioxidants (e.g., tocopherol and derivatives thereof and ascorbic acid and derivatives thereof); vitamins (e.g., B, D, K and their derivatives); antiperspirant actives (e.g., aluminum hydroxide and zirconium hydroxide); depilating agents (e.g., thioglycolate salts); anti-acne agents (e.g., salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide); abrasives and exfoliants (e.g., silicates, pumice, and polyethylene); and extracts of plant, fruit, vegetable and/or marine sources. </p><p num="p-0091"> It will also be understood by those having skill in the art that in some embodiments, the synthetic repeat sequence protein polymers are produced to have a combination of desirable characteristics.

The filtered SELP47K solution was then mixed with ammonium sulfate to 25% saturation, which led to precipitation of SELP47K. Precipitated SELP47K and mother liquor was mixed with a filter-aid and again filtered using RVDF. The RVDF cake containing SELP47K and filter-aid was mixed with cold water to dissolve the SELP47K. This precipitation and solubilization step was repeated one more time to improve the purity profile of the SELP47K. Purified monodispersed SELP47K was then water-exchanged until the conductivity of SELP solution reached 50 μS/cm<sup>2</sup>. The monodispersed SELP solution was then concentrated to 10% wt/vol and then lyophilized to make powdered monodispersed SELP47K protein polymer. The material was stored at −70° C. until needed for application testing. </p><p num="p-0155"> SELP variants were either obtained from PPTI or genetically engineered.

polymer subunits contain additional P4 (ALSYP; SEQ ID NO:36) peptide sequences were made as follows: Artificial gene synthesis was used to create a 2 subunit version of the desired construct in which each identical subunit contained a unique non-palindromic restriction site. Specifically, SELP subunits contained either BBI (Bowman-Birk Inhibitor)-derived P4 sequence (i.e., ALSYP; SEQ ID NO:36) incorporated in two places per subunit, flanking the silk region, incorporated between the C-terminal end of the silk region and the N-terminal end of the elastin region. A BsgI restriction enzyme cleavage site was designed within each subunit. </p><p num="p-0174"> The construct DNA was digested with BsgI, which resulted in the release of a single subunit per molecule. Resulting modified SELP monomers as well as plasmid vector were purified from agarose gels and concentrated using a Spin Vac. Monomers were self-ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) overnight at 16° C., as per the manufacturer's instructions. Original purified vector was added to the ligation mix with additional fresh ligase and incubated at 16° C. for an additional 24 hours. This ligation mix was used to transform <i>E. coli </i>TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting transformants were used to inoculate culture tubes containing 5 ml Luria broth and appropriate antibiotic. Tubes were incubated for 16 hrs, at 37° C., and with shaking at 250 rpm. Plasmids were purified from resulting cultures using a Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Complete SELP inserts were excised from vector by digestion with EcoRV and BamHI restriction enzymes and sized using agarose gel elecrophoresis in order to identify constructs containing the desired 13 total subunits. </p><p num="p-0175"> Appropriate SELP-P4 gene constructs were subcloned into a vector containing the lambda Pr promoter and transformed into production the host <i>E. coli </i>MM294. Prepared seed vials were stored at −80° C. These seed vials were used for fermentation of SELP47K-P4 repeat sequence protein polymers. The strain tested for fermentation run was MM294/pSELP01472 (SELP47K-P4; GC2596-26-D). The <i>E. coli </i>strain was incubated in defined TM2 medium and batched glucose. The fermentation was continued with a feed of 2 g/min of glucose upon consumption of batched glucose until the cells in the fermenters grew up to an OD of 60. The expression of SELP47K protein polymer was started with temperature induction by raising the fermentation temperature to 40° C. The fermentation and growth rates were very similar to that of SELP47K (Example 1). The cells grew well prior to, as well as after induction. Cell pastes were harvested by centrifuging fermentation broth after 20% drop in CER and with no further rise in OD. Purification of SELP47K-P4 RSPP test material was performed by first taking the cell paste in 1:2 ratio in DI water, followed by homogenizing the cells using French-Press at 8000 PSI. Homogenized cells were mixed with 0.1%-10% PEI (polyethyleneimine) to flock-out cell debris. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The cell extract generated from centrifugation was mixed with ammonium sulfate (10-25% saturation) to precipitate SELP47K-P4 RSPP test material. Precipitated SELP47K-P4 RSPP was separated from the solution and dissolved in either MQ water or a chaotropic agent (e.g., urea or guanidinium hydrochloride). SELP47K-P4 RSPP was purified by dialysis and then lyophilized as solid powder for storage, using methods known in the art. Analysis of purified P4-SELP47K was carried out using SDS gel electrophoresis as well as mass spectrometry to confirm the formation of fusion polymer. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 5 </heading><heading>Production of DCP6 (GC 2596-26-E) </heading><p num="p-0176"> In this Example, experiments conducted to isolate and purify a genetically engineered collagen-like repeat sequence protein block copolymer (DCP6) from <i>E. coli </i>are described. <i>E. coli </i>host MM294/pPPTI0301 strain containing a specific silk-repeat sequence protein copolymer DCP6 (GC2596-26-E) recombinant DNA was obtained from PPTI.

The isoelectric point of SELP47K was determined by electrophoresing 5 mg/ml SELP47K solution using Isoelectric Focusing Electrophoresis (IEF) gel and Novex electrophoresis apparatus along with protein standards markers. Analysis of the gel revealed that SELP47K is a cationic protein with an isoelectric point of 10.4. Analysis of the IEF gels for isoelectic point determination of other RSPP examples reported in Table 2 were found to be within (±0.2) range. </p><p num="p-0181"> The cloud point of SELP47K was determined by first preparing 0.1 % and 1% solutions of polydispersed SELP 47K (Example 2) in three different buffers: 50 mM acetate pH 5; 50 mM Tris pH 7; 50 mM Tris pH 9. A 0.5 M NaCl salt solution was prepared in water and salt containing solutions were prepared using this stock solution. Samples were placed in quartz cuvettes and the cloud point determination was carried out using a Cary 300 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermal program and multiple cuvettes configuration. Turbidity measurements were made at 300 m-n and the temperature was varied from 20-80° C. </p><p num="p-0182"> It was determined that increasing the concentration of SELP47K in water lowered the cloud point of the protein polymer. A 0.05% solution of protein remains soluble in water even at 80 ° C. However, a 1% solution has a cloud point of 70 ° C. It was also determined that increasing pH from 5 to 9 also has a lowering effect on the cloud point of the protein polymer in very dilute solutions. At pH 5, the 0.1% solution remained soluble even at 80° C. At pH 9, the cloud point of 0.1% protein solution dropped down to 60 ° C. The 1% protein polymer solution showed similar cloud point of 65 ° C. in the 5-9 pH range. </p><p num="p-0183"> It was also determined that increasing the salt concentration also lowered the cloud point of the SELP47K protein polymer. In pH 5 buffer, 1% protein polymer solution has a cloud point of 75° C. However, the cloud point was 65° C. with 0.2 M salt and below 60° C. when the salt concentration was raised to 0.5 M. The presence of a high salt concentration in dilute protein solutions had more affect on the cloud point than that of a relatively less dilute solution of protein polymer. A 0.1% solution had a cloud point of 50° C. when 0.5 M NaCl was present in the solution irrespective of pH. A 1% solution with 0.5 M salt has cloud point of 55° C. irrespective of pH. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 7 </heading><heading>Determination of the Glass Transition Temperature and Decomposition Temperature of SELP47K </heading><p num="p-0184"> In this Example, experiments performed to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) and decomposition temperature of SELP47K. (Example 1) are described. Approximately 10 mg of SELP47K material was crimped in an aluminum (Al) pan, cooled to &lt;−150° C., then heated to &gt;200° C. at 10° C./min under a He (helium) atmosphere. The sample displayed an endothermic peak ranging from approximately 6 to 180° C. This initially appeared to be followed by another endothermic region and the analysis was stopped near 225° C. The sample was examined and had darkened significantly from the light golden starting color. Another sample of material was examined by TGA and found to have mass loss (˜8%) from room temperature to approximately 200° C., confirming the broad endotherm observed with the first sample. </p><p num="p-0185"> A strip of SELP47K was examined by using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) over the range of −1 50 to 200° C. Three tan delta peaks were observed at −109, 70, and 189° C. The peak at 189° C. coincided with a significant drop in modulus and a step change half-height in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) run in the same region initially was thought to be another endotherm suggesting the Tg of the material is approximately 189° C. Another DSC sample was run, pre-heating at 100° C. for 1 hour initially to remove volatiles. The mass loss endotherm was mostly removed, and a transition at 188° C. (half-height) remained. This run was stopped and the sample cooled and examined. </p><p num="p-0186"> Based upon the results obtained, the material has a glass transition at approximately 189° C. Since there is mass loss on heating (water loss), this transition would be for the “film” material. Material degradation also appears to start near Tg. The decomposition temperature of this SELP47K was found to be 332° C. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 8 </heading><heading>Tensile Mechanical Properties of SELP47K </heading><p num="p-0187"> In this Example, experiments performed to determine tensile mechanical properties of SELP47K (Example 1 and 2) are described. Samples of SELP47K were prepared by freeze-drying purified SELP47K solution. The subsequent powder was re-dissolved in water to a solids concentration of approximately 5, 10 or 20%. These solutions were then mixed with plasticizers to an effective concentration of 1-3%. Plasticizers included in this study were polyethylene glycol 200, glycerin, and triethanolamine. Eleven milliliters of these solutions were poured into a large (6 inch square) polyethylene weigh boats and the solutions were allowed to dry either in an oven at 37° C. or room temperature for 1 to 3 days. Subsequent films were successfully peeled from the weigh boat with a spatula without any damage to the polymer film. </p><p num="p-0188"> The films were then cut into tensile specimens using a very sharp fabric cutting wheel. The specimens were approximately 6 cm long and 2.5 cm wide. The gauge length for these samples (length of sample between tensile testing clamps) was set to 3 cm and the thickness of the sample was measured at 5 points along the gauge length using a digital thickness coating instrument. The thickness of the samples was recorded as the average of the 5 points and varied from 46.4 to 188.2 microns. Both the sample width and sample thickness were entered into an Instron software program (Merlin) to enable it to calculate the tensile strength and tensile modulus. </p><p num="p-0189"> The samples were loaded into the jaws of an INSTRON® Model 5564 apparatus making sure the gauge length was always set to 3 cm and that the sample was not under any static load or stress. The 2,500 Newton (2.5 KN) load cell was used since these samples exhibited loads between 55 and 150 Newtons at break. The results of the stress-strain measurements can be seen for four of the samples in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The elongation % of SELP47K was determined to be 8.4 for 20% SELP47K solution film made at room temperature (RM). The tensile strength was determined to be 65.9 megapascals (MPa), and the tensile modulus was determined to be 1716.50 MPa. The results of plastisizer-SELP47K films reveal strong correlation between concentration and mechanical properties measured. For 3% PEG200 containing SELP47K, the films elongation % reached 541. The tensile strength (MPA) and tensile strain (%) for each protein polymer tested are provided in Table 3.

First, a thin film was cast, starting with a 10% solution of SELP47K in water was prepared. The spin coater used for making thin film was from Special Coating Systems Inc., model number P6708-D (Indianapolis, USA). The DV-1000 program was used for spinning the film. SELP47K protein solution was poured over a 316 stainless steel plate that was placed on the spinner. The spinner was rotated at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds followed by rotation at 1000 rpm for 90 seconds. The thin film was allowed to dry for an hour and the thickness of the film was measured using a magnetometer. The average thickness of the SELP47K thin film was between 2-5 μm. </p><p num="p-0192"> A SELP47K (Example 1) thick film was cast in the following manner. A 10% solution of SELP47K was prepared in deionized water (DI). This solution was poured to 1 mm in height into a plastic container and was allowed to set at 37° C. or room temperature for several hours leading to the formation of films. These films averaged between about 50-200 μm in thickness. </p><p num="p-0193"> A SELP47K (Example 1) clear thick film was cast in the following manner. A 5% solution of SELP47K was prepared in DI water. This solution was poured to 1 mm thickness on a sheet of Saran Wrap™ kept in a shallow plastic container. This container was maintained at room temperature overnight leading to the formation of a clear thick film of SELP47K. SELP47K film made though this method yielded excellent optical transparency. No X-ray diffraction pattern was obtained from this material, and, thus, the material of this film was amorphous in nature. A 1% water solution of SELP47K when analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, predicted 50% random coil and 50% beta sheet structure. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 10 </heading><heading>Microscopy of SELP47K </heading><p num="p-0194"> This Example describes microscopic studies of SELP47K (Example 1 and 2 material). In these experiments, the morphology of Silk Elastin Protein (SELP47K) was characterized using various microscopy techniques including: 1) optical microscopy; 2) Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM); and 3) Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). </p><p num="p-0195"> Four concentrations of the SELP material (13.5%, 1.35%, 0.135% and 0.0135%) were prepared in distilled water and spin-coated on to the surface of a plasma-treated wafer (hydrophilic surface) for examination. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> provide photomicrographs of SELP 47-K film showing self assembly into nanofilaments. </p><p num="p-0196"> AFM and SEM examination indicated that there was a coating over the entire surface of the wafer. The coating appeared to be comprised of densely packed intertwining strands. Microscopy results indicated that the SELP47K coating, when concentrated, is comprised of densely packed, long, intertwined strands. Short, single/double strands of material were found in areas where the coating appeared to be less concentrated. Individual strands of material could be seen in the less concentrated, gray areas on the wafer. SEM analysis of the films provide the basis of water-solubility of SELP47K films. A SELP47K film made out of 10% SELP47K solution gave a water-soluble film whereas a 20% solution film was water insoluble. In 10% SELP47K solution film, micellar droplet structures appeared to be responsible for its water solubility whereas 20% SELP47K solution film did not have the micellar droplet structures in the film. </p><p num="p-0197"> These strands ranged from 100 nm to 1 μm in length and 20-45 nm in diameter. These experiments confirm that SELP47K can be spun into a film and this film when studied using microscopic techniques reveal that film is composed in a non-woven web of filaments. The film is composed of nano filaments. Nano fibers of this protein can be thus utilized in various applications, such as personal care products, due to their strength, advantage of very large surface to mass ratio and protein based targeting characteristics. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 11 </heading><heading>Preparation of Rinse-Off Conditioners </heading><p num="p-0198"> In this Example, preparation of rinse-off conditioners is described.

A master hand of hair about eight inches in length was subdivided into a series of individual hair tresses. Each tress weighed about 2.5 grams. A ½ inch portion of the root end of the hair was trimmed and glued to a 2″×2″ plastic tab using DUCO CEMENT®. The final weight of each tress was approximately 2.0 g. The cement was allowed to dry, and the hair tress was combed and trimmed to a length so that six inches of hair was extended below the bottom of the plastic tab. A hole was punched in middle of tab ˜¼″ from the top. Each tress was rinsed for 15 seconds under 40° C. tap water. Using a pipette, 1.0 g of a 9% sodium lauryl sulfate (active) solution was applied and lathered through the tress for 30 seconds. The tress was rinsed for 30 seconds under running water. Excess water was removed from the tress by passing the tress between the index and middle fingers. The tresses were placed on a tray covered with paper towels and dried overnight. Each tress was hand combed three times with the narrow teeth of an ACE® comb and evaluated using the INSTRON® “WET” and the INSTRON® “DRY” COMBING procedures. </p><p num="p-0201"> For tests involving the rinse-off conditioner, the hair tress was rinsed with tap water for 15 seconds at 40° C. The test conditioner was applied to the tress in the amount of 0.8 g and the tress was stroked for 30 seconds. The tress was rinsed for 30 seconds under tap water at 40° C. The excess water was removed by pulling the tress through the index and middle fingers. The tresses were allowed to dry separately on a paper towel, overnight at room temperature. The tresses were combed once before performing the INSTRON® study. </p><p num="p-0202"> INSTRON® COMBING is an industry recognized test for determining hair conditioning by the ease of wet combing and the ease of dry combing. The test employs an INSTRON® strain gauge, which is equipped to measure the force required to comb the hair. Conditioning performance is based on the ability of a particular hair treatment formulation such as a shampoo or a hair conditioner to reduce the force required to comb the hair with the INSTRON® strain gauge. The force is reported as Average Combing Load (ACL). The lower ACL value, the better the conditioning effect imparted by the formulation being tested. Typically, ACL baselines are initially established with “untreated” tresses that have only been washed with the sodium lauryl sulfate solution. The effectiveness of a treatment can be expressed as the ACL of the treated tress or the % Reduction in ACL which is calculated by ((untreated hair ACL-treated hair ACL)/untreated hair ACL)*100. </p><p num="p-0203"> According to the INSTRON® WET COMBING method, the hair was first wet by dipping it in distilled water and then the hair was detangled by combing the tress three times. The tress was then retangled by dipping in distilled water three times. The excess water was removed by passing the tress through index and middle fingers twice. The tress was then placed on the hanger and INSTRON combed. The “retangle” and “INSTRON® combing” steps were repeated until all data points were collected. An average combing force of three tresses was measured for each treatment. The results of the INSTRON® WET COMBING test conducted with the conditioners of the present invention are shown below in Table 5. Letters in the % ACL Reduction column are used to indicate that the product is superior to other designated products at a 90% confidence level. The results show that the performance of the conditioner containing the polydispersed silk elastin compound of the present invention provided a small reduction in dry combing forces compared to the conditioners that contained the hydrolyzed silk and elastin proteins. The performance of these two conditioners actually showed an increase in combing forces compared to the untreated tress.

After a seven-day conditioning phase, subjects were acclimated to the ambient temperature and humidity for thirty minutes. One side of the face of each subject was designated as the measurement side by random selection by computer. After 30-minute acclimation period, baseline digital photographs were taken, and instrumental measurements, skin replica samples and visual evaluations were made. Photographs were taken, with a Canfield Scientific Camera, of the full face, the periorbital area, and the temporal side of eye. Chromameter (Model CR300, Minolta) measurements were taken from the periorbital area directly under the eye (Chardon et al., Int. J. Cosmet. Sci., 13:191-208 [1991]). Silflo replicas (CuDerm Corporation, Dallas, Tex.) were made from the periorbital area adjacent to the temporal side of the eye (Grove et al., J. Am. Acad. Dermatol., 21:631-637 [1998]; and Sun et al 1997 IFSCC Conference, Mexico). Cutometer (SEM575, Courage and Khazaka, Germany) measurements were taken at the periorbital area at the upper portion of cheekbone. All measurements were performed in triplicate. An assessment of the relative depth and frequency of facial lines was performed by the method of Packman and Gans (Packman and Gans, J. Soc. Cosmet. </p><p num="p-0213"> Chem., 29:79-90 [1978]). </p><p num="p-0214"> After baseline control data were collected, 5% SELP47K aqueous solution was applied to the face of each subject. A few drops of the SELP47K solution was dispensed onto the fingertips and smoothed into the skin of the face. Subjects were retained in the lab for 30 minutes after application of the SELP47K aqueous solution, at which point a second set of measurements were made. </p><p num="p-0215"> Image analysis of Silflo replicas was done. Specifically, the fine line factors, which approximate the number and/or length of facial lines in the 10 evaluated bands of skin replica, were measured. At 30 minutes after application of SELP47K, fine line factors decreased by a statistically significant 13% (p=0.05). The statistical comparisons of the fine lines factors are summarized in Table 13.

The 10% SELP47K solution was prepared by adding SELP47K powder to water while propeller mixing. Phase 1 water was added to a tared stainless steel beaker (approximately 50 g excess was added to compensate for loss). Phase 2 methylparaben was added to butylene glycol and stirred while warming on top of a steam bath until dissolved, then added to the water with slow homomixer agitation. Then, the phase 4 black iron oxide was added, while maintaining agitation. Then, Natrosol was sprinkled in, while maintaining agitation. The 10% KOH was added, and heating was begun to 85° C., with the beaker covered as tightly as possible. When the Natrosol was dissolved, the 10% citric acid was added dropwise, maintaining temperature and agitation. Then, the Arlacel 165 was added slowly and mixed for at least 5 minutes to insure dissolution. At 85-90° C., the wax phase was slowly added to the water phase while homomixing. The temperature and agitation are maintained for 10 minutes. The batch was removed from the steam bath and allowed to cool while homomixing with occasional hand scraping of the beaker walls. At 55° C., the batch was weighed to check for water loss. Mixing was resumed and water was added back, if necessary. At 45° C., phases 9 and 10 were added. Cooling was continued using cold water to 30° C. At this point, continuous hand scraping of beaker walls was necessary. </p><p num="p-0225"> In this preparation, the small amount of KOH (in Phase 5) is used to raise the pH to disperse the Natrosol which is coated with glyoxal to retard wetting, and prevent agglomeration. In phase 7, the citric acid is added slowly to adjust pH to ˜5.5, below the isoelectric point of the iron oxides. In phases 7 and 8, the Arlacel 165 is split between the oil and water phases, as the emulsification is easier to accomplish with surfactant in both phases. In phase 9, the deionized water was added in the control batch instead of SELP47K. The SELP47K solution was prepared while the emulsion was being processed, so it was absolutely fresh. This preparation provides a formulation suitable for use as a mascara. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 16 </heading><heading>Bioactivity Determination of RSPPs Using Human Skin Fibroblast Cells In-Vitro </heading><p num="p-0226"> In this Example, experiments conducted to determine bioactivity of repeat sequence protein polymers (RSPP) such as SELP47K and others (i.e., GC2596-26-A-E) in procollagen synthesis, matrix metaloprotease-1 (MMP-1) activity, and elastin production as well as elastase activity are described. The RSPP test materials used in these experiments are those shown in Table 1. </p><p num="p-0227"> As dermal fibroblasts are the main source of extracellular matrix proteins, including large structural proteins such as collagen and elastin, as well as the enzymes that metabolize these proteins (e.g., Matrix Metalloprotease-1 [MMP-1] and elastase) within the skin, these experiments were conducted to determine bioactivity of RSPP in influencing collagen synthesis, elastin production, and MMP-1 activity. An accepted cultured human fibroblast model was used in these experiments. </p><p num="p-0228"> Initial screening was conducted to identify a test range suitable to determine the effect of a broad range of test material concentrations on cell viability. In particular, these initial screening experiments were conducted in order to ensure that the concentrations of test RSPPs used within the study had a no cytotoxic effect. Cultured fibroblasts were exposed to the test materials for 48 hours and then changes in cell viability were determined using an MTT assay (i.e., a calorimetric analysis of the metabolic activity of the cultured cells, described in greater detail below). </p><p num="p-0229"> When cells are treated with MTT, it is reduced by the mitochondria, which results in the formation of insoluble purple formazin crystals that are trapped within the cell. The purple crystals are extracted from the cells with isopropanol and the amount of crystal formation quantified spectrophotometrically. The intensity of the purple color is directly proportional to the metabolic activity of the cultured cells, which normally is used as an indication of an increase in the number of viable cells, although it can also indicate an increase in the mitochondrial content of the existing cells (Alley et al., Cancer Res., 48:589-601 1988). A decrease in color intensity can be a sign of toxicity. </p><p num="p-0230"> Once an experimentally useful range of RSPP test material concentrations was determined, their effect on procollagen synthesis, elastin production and MMP-1 activity were then determined. All three of these markers are released into the cell culture media by the fibroblasts. Thus, after 48 hours of exposure to the test RSPP materials the media were collected and assayed. </p><p num="p-0231"> Collagen is synthesized as part of a much larger procollagen peptide. As the peptide is processed to form a mature collagen protein, the propeptide portion is cleaved off (type I C-peptide). Both the mature collagen protein and the type I C-peptide fragment are then released into the extracellular environment and accumulate in the culture media. Since there is a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between the two parts of the procollagen peptide, assaying for type I C-peptide will reflect the amount of collagen synthesized. Type 1 C-peptide can be assayed via an ELISA based method. </p><p num="p-0232"> Elastin is released by fibroblasts (soluble elastin) into the extracellular space where it is then cross-linked to other elastin proteins to form an extensive network of fibers and sheets (insoluble elastin). Soluble elastin can be readily measured from cell culture medium via a colorimetric assay. </p><p num="p-0233"> MMP-1 is a zinc and calcium dependent endopeptidase that is produced and released from both dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and functions to break down collagens located in the extracellular matrix. Active MMP-1 released into the culture media can be assayed using a fluorescence-based ELISA. Briefly, antibodies covalently linked to a solid support will bind any MMP-1 (both active and inactive MMP-1) present in spent culture media samples. To quantify the active MMP-1 a fluorogenic substrate linked to a quencher molecule is added and any active MMP-1 present will cleave the peptide linkage between the fluorophore and the quencher molecule. This cleavage will eliminate the quencher molecules ability to inhibit the fluorescent signal of the fluorophore allowing a fluorescent signal that will be proportional to the amount of active MMP-1 present. The MMP-1 standards used with the ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems) used in the experiments described herein are provided in an inactive form and need to be activated by exposing them to p-aminophenylmercuric before adding the fluorogenic substrate. </p><p num="p-0234"> The RSPP test materials were also tested to determine their effect(s) on elastase activity. In these experiments, human dermal fibroblasts were used as a source of the elastase enzyme. This enzyme was partially purified from the fibroblasts by lysing the cells in an elastase buffer and retaining the soluble portion of the lysate. Portions of this fibroblast lysate were then incubated with test materials and a synthetic elastase substrate, Suc-(Ala<sub>3</sub>)-p-Nitroaniline (STANA). Elastase acts upon this substrate to release p-nitroaniline, which can be detected spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 405 nm. An inhibition of the elastase enzyme is noted by a decrease in the amount of released p-nitroaniline when compared to uninhibited enzyme. </p><p num="p-0235"> A.

On the following day, the medium was removed via aspiration to eliminate any non-adherent cells and replaced with fresh FGM. The cells were grown until confluent, with a media change every 48 to 72 hours. Upon reaching confluency, the cells were treated for 24 hours with Dulbecco's Modified Essential Media (DMEM) supplemented with 1.5% FBS to wash out any effects from the growth factors included in the normal FGM. After this 24-hour wash out period, the cells were treated with the test materials at the specified concentrations dissolved in DMEM with 1.5% FBS. Untreated cells (negative controls) received DMEM with 1.5% FBS. The cells were incubated for 48 hours and at the end of the incubation period cell culture medium was either discarded (pilot work) or collected and stored frozen at −75° C. The test materials were tested in triplicate. </p><p num="h-0044"> MTT Assay </p><p num="p-0237"> After the 2-day incubation, the cell culture medium was removed and the fibroblasts were washed twice with PBS to remove any remaining test material. After the final wash, either 100 μl (96-well plates) or 300 μl (12-well plates) of DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml MTT were added to each well and the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37±2° C. and 5±1% CO<sub>2</sub>. After the incubation, the DMEM/MTT solution was removed and the cells were washed again once with PBS and then either 100 μl (96-well plates) or 1 ml (12-well plates) of isopropyl alcohol were added to each well to extract the purple formazin crystals. For the 12-well plates, two hundred microliters of the isopropyl extracts was transferred to a 96-well plate. The 96-well plates were read at 540 nm using isopropyl alcohol as a blank. The mean MTT absorbance value for the negative control cells was calculated and used to represent 100% value for cell viability. The individual MTT values from the cells undergoing the various treatments were then divided by the mean value for the negative control cells and expressed as a percent, to determine the change in cell viability caused by each treatment. </p><p num="h-0045"> Procollagen Assay </p><p num="p-0238"> Takara procollagen type IC-peptide ELISA kits were used in these experiments. A series of type I C-peptide standards was prepared ranging from 40 ng/ml to 640 ng/ml. An ELISA microplate was then prepared by removing any unneeded strips from the plate frame. To each well in the plate 100 μl of peroxidase-labeled anti procollagen type I-C peptide was added, followed by 20 μl of either sample (tissue culture media) or standard. The microplate was covered and allowed to incubate for 3±0.25 hours at 37° C. After the incubation period, each well was aspirated and washed three times with 400 μl of wash buffer. After the last wash was removed, 100 μl of peroxidase substrate solution (hydrogen peroxide containing tetramethylbenzidine as a chromagen) were added to each well and the plate was incubated for 15±5 minutes at room temperature. After the incubation period, 100 μl of stop solution (1 N sulfuric acid) was added to each well and the plate was read using a microplate reader at 450 nm. To quantify the amount of procollagen present, a standard curve was generated using known concentrations of procollagen type 1-C peptide. A linear regression was then performed to establish the line that best fit these data points. Mean absorbance values for the test materials and untreated samples was then used to estimate the amount of procollagen type 1-C peptide present in each sample. </p><p num="h-0046"> MMP-1 Assay </p><p num="p-0239"> R&amp;D Products MMP-1 Flurokine E fluorometric ELISA kits were used in these experiments. A series of MMP-1 standards was prepared ranging from 0.39 ng/ml to 25 ng/ml and an ELISA microplate was prepared by removing any unneeded strips from the plate frame. In each well, 200 μl of Assay Diluent RD1-64 and 50 μl of each sample were added. For the standards, 100 μl of Assay Diluent RD 1-64 and 150 μl of each respective standard were added. The plate was incubated for 3±0.25 hours at room temperature on a rocking platform. At the end of the incubation period, each well was aspirated and then washed four times with 400 μl of wash buffer. Since the MMP-1 enzyme standards included with the assay kit are provided in an inactive form, after the last wash was removed, 200 μl of p-aminophenylmercuric acetate in Reagent Dilution solution was added to the standards to activate MMP-1, while Reagent Dilution solution only was added to the samples and the plate was incubated for 2±0.25 hours at 37±2° C. After the incubation period, the plate was washed four times as described above. After the last wash, 200 μl of substrate solution were added to each well and the plate was incubated for 17-20 hours at 37±2° C. (protected from light). At the end of the incubation period, the fluorescence intensity was measured (excitation 320 nm, emission 405 nm) using a fluorometer using a 20 mS integration time. To quantify the amount of MMP-1 activity, a standard curve was generated using known activity levels of MMP-1. A linear regression was performed to establish the line that best fit these data points. Mean absorbance values for the test materials and untreated samples were then used to estimate the amount of MMP-1 activity present in each sample. </p><p num="h-0047"> Elastin Assay </p><p num="p-0240"> In these experiments, the Biocolor Fastin Elastin Assay kits were used. A 50 μl aliquot of sample material (cell culture medium for soluble elastin) was mixed with 1.0 ml of cold Fastin Precipitating Reagent in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. In addition to the spent media samples from the fibroblasts, 50 μl aliquots of the test materials diluted into fresh culture media at the concentrations used in the study were also assayed for elastin content. The sample/Fastin Precipitating Reagent mixture was then incubated overnight in an ice water bath to precipitate the elastin. On the following day, the cold microcentrifuge tubes were spun at 10,000×g for 10 minutes to pack the precipitated elastin and the supernatant was removed via careful aspiration. </p><p num="p-0241"> One (1) ml of Fastin Dye Reagent, along with 100 μl of 90% saturated ammonium sulphate was added to each tube. The microcentrifuge tubes were mixed with a vortex mixer and then allowed to incubate for at least 60 minutes at room temperature, with gentle mechanical agitation. The Fastin Dye Reagent interacts with unique amino acid sequences in the elastin protein. This elastin-dye complex precipitates in the presence of ammonium sulphate. After the incubation was over, the microcentrifuge tubes were spun at 10,000×g for 10 minutes to separate the precipitated elastin-dye complex from the unbound dye. The supernatant was carefully removed and the tubes were inverted to allow any residual supernatant to drain out. </p><p num="p-0242"> To release the elastin-bound dye, 1.0 ml of Fastin Destain reagent was added to each microcentrifuge tube. The tubes were capped as quickly as possible, as this reagent contains ammonia and methanol. The tubes were then vortexed. The absorbance of this solution was measured by a plate reader at 490 nm (200 μl volume read). </p><p num="p-0243"> An elastin standard curve was generated using 12.5, 25, and 50 μg aliquots of an Elastin Standard into microcentrifuge tubes (in duplicate). These samples were treated as described above (Elastin Assay) and the absorbance values were used to generate a standard curve of known concentrations. To derive the standard curve for the elastin assay, the absorbance was plotted against the elastin concentration in μg/ml for the standards. A linear regression was performed to establish the line that best fit these data points. Mean absorbance values for the test materials and untreated samples were then used to estimate the amount of elastin present in each sample. </p><p num="p-0244"> B.

Cells were expanded and passed until a sufficient number of cells had been grown (not exceeding 10 passages). When a sufficient number of cells had been grown, the fibroblast lysate containing the elastase enzyme was prepared as follows: </p><p num="h-0049"> Fibroblast Lysate Procedure </p><p num="p-0246"> The fibroblasts were washed twice with 15 ml of phosphate buffered saline with each wash removed via aspiration. Ice cold PBS (7.5 ml) was then added to the flask and the cells were detached with a cell scraper. The detached cells/PBS was transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube on ice. The flask was rinsed again with 7.5 ml of PBS, which was also transferred to the 15 ml tube. The tube was then centrifuged at 1,200 RPM for 5 minutes and the supernatant was removed via aspiration. The pellet of cells was resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold 2× elastase buffer and sonicated for 10 seconds (maximum setting) to lyse the cells. The sonication was repeated until the contents of the tube were clear while the tube was maintained on ice. The tube was then centrifuged at 2,200 RPM for 10 minutes at 4° C. and the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube (this portion of the fibroblast lysate contained the elastase enzyme) and kept on ice. The protein concentration of the fibroblast lysate was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (see below for details) and the fibroblast lysate was stored at −75° C. until used (for up to 1 year). </p><p num="h-0050"> Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay </p><p num="p-0247"> Fifty volumes of Reagent A (BCA) were combined with 1 volume of Reagent B (4% (w/v) CuSO<sub>4</sub>-5 H<sub>2</sub>O) in a 15-ml centrifuge tube. For the assay, proteins reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) in a concentration dependent manner. BCA then reacts with the Cu(I) to form a purple colored complex with a maximum absorbance at 562 nm. Two hundred microliters of this combined reagent were dispensed into each well of a 96-well plate. Next, 10 μl of each of the standards were added into their respective wells (standards were made using 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin dissolved in elastase buffer, and then a series of 50% dilutions was made down to 0.0078 mg/ml). Ten μl of elastase buffer was added to two wells to serve as blanks. The standards and blank were prepared in duplicate, while lysate samples were prepared in triplicate.

The activity was determined for each of the different concentrations in exactly the same way that the uninhibited sample was treated in the elastase assay (see below). First, 100 μl of lysate was loaded into three wells, while 100 μl of 2× Elastase buffer was added to three additional wells to serve as blanks. Then, 100 μl of diluted DMSO (1 part DMSO, 49 parts deionized water) was added to all six wells used and the 96-well plate was incubated for 15 minutes at 37±2° C. Then, 4 μl of STANA was added to each well used, and the 96-well plate was returned to the incubator for 1.25 hours. After 1.25 hours, the well plate was removed and read in a 96-well plate reader at 405 nm. The mean absorbances were plotted versus concentration. These values were used to estimate a concentration that will produce a spectrophotometric measurement of 0.4 to 0.5 using a linear regression analysis of the best-fit line through all three (1×, 0.5× and 0.25×) data points. The remaining fibroblast lysate was diluted to the appropriate concentration to elicit the desired level of activity. </p><p num="h-0052"> Test Material Preparation </p><p num="p-0249"> For this assay, test materials were prepared in deionized water at 2× their final desired concentration. Since each material was tested at final concentrations of 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%, they were prepared at stock concentrations of 2%, 1% and 0.2%. 10 mM and 3 μM phosphoramidon served as the positive control, while a 50 fold dilution of DMSO in deionized water served as a negative (uninhibited) control. </p><p num="p-0250"> As these testing materials were hypothesized to potential inhibit the breakdown of STANA by the elastase enzyme via a competitive mechanism, the STANA substrate was mixed with the test materials so that they were added to the assay simultaneously. The STANA substrate was mixed with the stock test material solutions at a ratio of 4 μl of STANA for every 100 μl of stock test material solution. </p><p num="h-0053"> Elastase Enzyme Assay, Modified Procedure </p><p num="p-0251"> Six wells in a 96-well plate were reserved for each concentration of test material. In three of the wells 100 μl of fibroblast lysate (lysate lot 082103) in 2× elastase buffer were added, while in the three remaining wells, 100 μl of 2× elastase buffer alone were added. After the wells were prepared with lysate or buffer, 100 μl of test material solution, phosphoramidon control, or diluted DMSO was added to the 6 wells reserved for each respective test. The plate was then covered and incubated at 37±2° C. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes and 120 minutes using a microplate reader. </p><p num="p-0252"> For the elastase assay, the mean absorbance values for the three wells containing the various test materials and the fibroblast lysate were used as an index of elastase activity. The remaining three wells, containing the test materials and the elastase buffer were used to determine the amount of background absorbance due to either the test material itself or the non-specific breakdown of STANA. To correct the absorbance value associated with elastase activity, the background absorbance value was subtracted. To determine the percent of elastase inhibition induced by the test material, the following equation was used:

Summary of Data and Results </p><p num="p-0262"> The initial dose response work (See, Table 17) with this set of peptides revealed a broad range of effects. Peptides GC2596-26-A, GC2596-26-C and GC2596-26-D were observed to strongly stimulate increases in the number of viable cells in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, peptides GC2596-26-B and GC2596-26-E) were observed to reduce the number of viable cells, with peptide B only having this effect at the highest concentration tested. GC2596-26-E had adverse effects at concentrations equal to or greater than 0.07%. </p><p num="p-0263"> In view of these initial results, peptides GC2596-26-A, GC2596-26-B and GC2596-26-C were tested at 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% concentrations, while peptide GC2596-26-D was tested at 0.014%, 0.007% and 0.0014%, and GC2596-26-E was tested at 0.01%, 0.005% and 0.001% for the cell culture based assays. After 48 hours of incubation with the materials, the culture media were collected for analysis and the cells were again subjected to an MTT assay. The results for the second cell viability assay (See, Table 18) were confirmed the earlier results shown in Table 17, at the concentrations tested. </p><p num="p-0264"> In the next set of experiments, the effect of the RSPP test materials on collagen synthesis was assessed (See, Table 19). Of these, RSPP test material GC2596-26-B showed improvement in collagen synthesis. Collagen synthesis was observed to be elevated at the 0.5% and 0.1% concentrations. However, at the 1% concentration, the amount of collagen synthesis declined back down to a level similar to the untreated group. The reason for this decline in collagen synthesis at the 1% concentration may possibly be related to the negative effect on cell viability that this material is also observed to have at this concentration, as shown in Table 23, below. Thus, when a ratio of collagen synthesis to viability is taken into account, RSPP test material GC2596-26-B improves collagen synthesis at all of the concentrations tested (i.e., as compared to the control).

RSPP test materials GC2596-26-D and GC2596-26-E resulted in an almost complete loss of detectable MMP-1 activity in the samples. Although it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular mechanism, possible explanations include down-regulation of the gene expression of MMP-1, thereby shutting off the production of this enzyme. Another hypothesis is that the peptide prevented activation of any MMP-1 produced. Normally, MMP-1 is synthesized and released in an inactive form that must be activated extracellularly by MMP-3. If these two RSPP test materials were inhibiting MMP-3, then this would also have the effect of preventing MMP-1 activation. </p><p num="p-0266"> Aside from collagen, another major component of the skins extracellular matrix is elastin. Like collagen, the elastin content of the skin is determined both by its rate of synthesis and its rate of degradation by elastase. With respect to elastin synthesis (See, Table 21), RSPP test material GC2596-26-A was observed to stimulate an excellent increase. On the degradation side (See, Table 22), RSPP test material GC2596-26-C was observed to inhibit the elastase enzyme, with an inhibition level of about 20%. </p><p num="p-0267"> With respect to the elastin production assay, it should be noted that there was some concern that the RSPP test materials themselves might interfere with the assay since they contain sequences similar to elastin. Table 21 shows the results of assaying culture media supplemented with the highest concentrations of each of the test materials and for all 5 RSPP test materials there was no elastin detected. Thus, there appeared to be no interference with the assay methods due to the RSPP tested materials. </p><heading>EXAMPLE 17 </heading><heading>UVB Protective Effect of SELP47K -P4 RSPP </heading><p num="p-0268"> This Example describes experiments conducted to assess the ability of SELP47K-P4 RSPP (GC 2596-26-D) to exert a protective effect by promoting cell survival after UVB exposure. </p><p num="p-0269"> In these experiments, the test material was tested at six concentrations with two duplicate sets of cells prepared. The first set of cells was exposed to approximately 50 mj/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UVB, which has been shown to reduce the number of viable cells by up to 50%, followed immediately by the application of either the test material, 20 μM Trolox (an anti-oxidant, used as a positive control), or left untreated (untreated controls). The second set of cells did not receive a dose of UVB and was just exposed to either the test material, Trolox, or left untreated. Changes in cell viability were then determined 48 hours post material application via an MTT assay, as described above. </p><p num="p-0270"> As discussed in greater detail herein, the results suggested that the RSPP test material GC2596-26-D was capable of both improving cell survival when it was applied after UVB exposure, and also able to induce cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner. Therefore, the aim of the follow-up study, was to determine if treatment with the test material before or during UVB exposure provided any additional survival benefit(s). Four different treatment regiments were employed using different combinations of pretreatment with the test material prior to UVB exposure and treatment with the material during UVB exposure. Cell survival was again assessed via an MTT assay 48 hours after the UVB insult. In addition, this second study also incorporated the use of 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF), which is a relatively non-fluorescent dye that can be loaded into cells and becomes fluorescent upon exposure to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during UVB exposure (Carini et al., Il Farmaco 55:526-534 [2000]; and Chan et al., J. Cell. Biochem., 90:327-338 [2003]). The diacetate form of the dye can freely traverse cell membranes, however once inside of the cell intracellular esterases will cleave off the acetate side groups trapping the DCF dye within the cell. The results confirmed the UVB protective effect of the RSPP test material 2596-26-D when applied post UVB exposure, and also indicated that its protective effect was improved when the material was also present both before and/or during UVB exposure. </p><p num="h-0056"> Preparation of Fibroblasts </p><p num="p-0271"> Fibroblasts were seeded into the individual wells of a 96 well plate in 100 μl FGM, and incubated overnight at 37±2° C. and 5±1% CO<sub>2</sub>.

After exposure, the PBS was removed and replaced with FGM supplemented with either the test materials, 20 μM Trolox, or left unsupplemented.

In the initial study, two duplicate sets of cultured fibroblasts were exposed to six concentrations of the test material. The first set of cells was exposed to approximately 50 mj/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UVB, followed immediately by the application of either the test material, 20 μM Trolox (an anti-oxidant, used as a positive control), or left untreated (untreated controls). The second set of cells did not receive a dose of UVB and was only exposed to either the test material, Trolox, or left untreated. Changes in cell viability were then determined 48 hours post material application via an MTT assay. </p><p num="p-0286"> Table 25 shows the results for this first study. With respect to the untreated cells, the dose of UVB was observed to induce an approximate 45% decrease in the number of viable cells (Untreated −UVB vs. Untreated +UVB). However, in the presence of the test material, this decrease in the number of viable cells induced by +UVB appears to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was most prominent at the highest concentration of test material used (0.14%), where the level of cell viability (104%) is nearly identical to the untreated −UVB exposed cells and almost twice the level of the untreated +UVB exposed cells. As the concentration of the test material decreased, so did the apparent protective effect, although even at the lowest level of the material, 0.0007%, the number of viable cells is still slightly greater than the +UVB untreated controls (69% vs. 55%, respectively). </p><p num="p-0287"> It was also observed that in the absence of UVB light, RSPP test material GC2596-26-D could also stimulate cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner. At the highest concentration tested (0.14%), the number of viable cells in the −UVB condition was observed to be 54% greater than the −UVB untreated cells. This stimulation effect was apparent over the entire range of material D tested, with the level of proliferation decreasing as the concentration of the material decreased. </p><p num="p-0288"> Although it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular mechanism, it is hypothesized that the material protects the cells by limiting the amount of damage or facilitates the repair of the damage. Thus, the population of viable cells is better maintained than it is in the untreated condition. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the increase in the number of viable cells tends to be greater between the +UVB untreated and the +UVB 0.14% test material conditions (50% viability vs. 100% viability, respectively, double the number of viable cells) than in the −UVB untreated and the −UVB test material conditions (100% viability vs. 150% viability, respectively, only a 50% increase). This suggests that in the presence of UVB there is a greater increase in the number of viable cells than can be accounted for by purely stimulating cell proliferation in the surviving cells alone, and supports the explanation that the RSPP test material GC2596-26-D does provide protection against UVB induced damage. </p><p num="p-0289"> Since the results of the initial MTT study suggested that the RSPP test material GC2596-26-D was capable of improving cell survival when it was applied after UVB exposure, a follow up study was conducted to determine if treatment with the test material before or during UVB exposure provided any additional survival benefit. Four different treatment regiments were employed using different combinations of pretreatment with the test material prior to UVB exposure and treatment with the material during UVB exposure. Cell survival was again assessed via an MTT assay 48 hours after the UVB insult. In addition, this second study also incorporated the use of 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF), which is a relatively non-fluorescent dye that can be loaded into cells and becomes fluorescent upon exposure to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during UVB exposure (Carini et al., supra; and Chan et al., supra). The diacetate form of the dye can freely traverse cell membranes, however once inside of the cell intracellular esterases will cleave off the acetate side groups trapping the DCF dye within the cell. </p><p num="p-0290"> The results from the follow up experiments confirmed the UVB protective effect of the test material when applied post UVB exposure, and also indicated that its protective effect was improved when the material was also present both before and/or during UVB exposure. In this follow up study, Treatment 3 was identical to the treatment regimen used in the initial experiments, with the test material being applied after the UVB exposure, and shows similar results with respect to the MTT assay (See, Table 26). At the 0.14% concentration, cell viability after UVB exposure was again found to be close to 100% after the UVB exposure (vs. 104% in the initial study), and at the 0.014% concentration, cell viability was 88% (vs. 83% in the initial study). At both concentrations the amount of cell survival was greater than the amount of cell survival in the untreated cells. In addition, the use of the DCF dye allowed for an estimate of the amount of oxidative damage occurring within the cell as a result of the UVB exposure (See, Table 27). For this marker, the greater the value of the ratio, the greater the extent of the ROS formation within the cell. With respect to Treatment 3, both concentrations of the test material were observed to reduce the amount of ROS formed in a concentration-dependent manner, when compared to the +UVB control. These results confirm observations from the earlier study and further support that the test material 2596-26-D can provide UVB protection. </p><p num="p-0291"> Treatments 1 and 2 incorporated a 24-hour pretreatment phase with the test material prior to the UVB exposure, with treatment 2 also having the test material present during the UVB exposure phase as well. When the material was present at 0.14%, cell viabilities in both treatments were greater than both the +UVB and −UVB controls. This may be mainly due to the fact that since this material stimulates cell proliferation, the cells undergoing the 24-hour pretreatment were growing at a faster rate than the rest of the cells in the experiment. However, the data from the DCF assay indicates that this pretreatment was effective in reducing the amount of ROS formation. Interestingly, the DCF assay also indicates that the material effectively reduced ROS formation at the 0.014% concentration, although the data from the MTT assay only shows a small increase in cell viability with this concentration of material D. Both Treatment 1 and 2 produced similar results, with Treatment 2 resulting in slightly less ROS formation, suggesting that the 24 hour pretreatment alone may be sufficient in providing protection and that having the material present again during UVB exposure may only provide minimal additional benefits. </p><p num="p-0292"> The final Treatment (i.e., Treatment 4), involved having the material present during the UVB exposure. At 0.14% concentration, cell viability and ROS formation is comparable to Treatments 1 and 2 and clearly demonstrates a UVB protective effect. Thus it appears that having the material around at the 0.14% concentration either for 24 hour before exposure, or just during exposure provides a similar level of protection. </p><p num="p-0293"> All publications and patents mentioned in the above specification are herein incorporated by reference.
