<ul list-style="bullet"><li>a) addition to the fluoropolymer dispersion of an anionic polyelectrolyte;</li><li>b) contact of the dispersion with an anionic exchanger;</li><li>c) separation of the dispersion from the anionic exchanger and recovery of the dispersion substantially fluorinated anionic surfactant free.</li></ul></p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="p0001">The present invention relates to a process for preparing aqueous fluoropolymer dispersions substantially fluorinated surfactant free, in particular fluorinated ionic surfactant free.</p><p num="p0002">More specifically the present invention relates to a process for preparing dispersions of fluoropolymers substantially perfluorooctanoate free in the form of acid or its salts.</p><p num="p0003">With aqueous dispersions of fluoropolymers substantially fluorinated anionic surfactant free it is meant that the fluorinated surfactant content referred to the fluoropolymer weight is lower than 100 ppm, in particular lower than 50 ppm, more in particular lower than 5 ppm.</p><p num="p0004">It is well known in the prior art that for,the production of fluorinated polymers there are two different polymerization processes: the suspension polymerization and the emulsion polymerization. In suspension polymerization polymer granules having millimetric sizes are obtained. In emulsion polymerization a colloidal aqueous dispersion is obtained having particle diameters of the order from some nanometers, generally from 10 nm, to hundreds of nanometers, from 100 nm to 400 nm. The fluoropolymer emulsion polymerization process is carried out with a mild stirring and in the presence of surfactants not acting as chain transfer agents to avoid to obtain low molecular weight fluoropolymers and therefore with poor mechanical properties. Said surfactants are called non telogenic surfactants, see for example USP 2,559,752. Salts of perfluoroalkanoic acid, in particular the ammonium salt and/or alkaline metal salts of the perfluorooctanoic acid, indicated hereinafter as PFOA, are industrially very often used. Other anionic (per)fluorinated surfactants are also used, see for example USP 3,271,341, USP 4,380,618, USP 4,864,006, USP 5,789,508. The PFOA is the most industrially used surfactant<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> in the emulsion polymerization since it is not telogen, thus allowing to obtain dispersions of fluorinated polymers having high molecular weight and allows to obtain stable dispersions for long periods of time. It is also known that in the applications of fluoropolymer dispersion, as coating or in the impregnation of fibers, in particular glass fibers, said fluorinated surfactants can reach the environment, for example through the washing effluents, or disperse in the atmosphere during the drying and/or sintering steps. However some of said surfactants have been classified as dangerous for the environment and are characterized by a low bioelimination rate from the human body. For example, the PFOA seems to belong to the surfactants particularly dangerous for the environment and with long residence times in men. Therefore there is a request from users of fluoropolymer dispersions substantially fluorinated anionic surfactant free and in particular PFOA free.</p><p num="p0005">The fluoropolymer dispersions are obtained from the emulsion polymerization process with a concentration of the fluorinated polymer between 20% and 35% by weight referred to 100 parts by weight of the dispersion.</p><p num="p0006">The fluoropolymer dispersions obtained from the polymerization process can be subjected to post-treatments to obtain concentrated fluoropolymer dispersions, even up to 75% w/w. The concentration processes can be carried out, for example, by a decantation, as described, for example, in USP 3,037,953, USP 3,704,272 and USP 3,301,807. Another concentration process of the fluoropolymer dispersions is the so called ultrafiltration process, as described for example in USP 4,369,266 and USP 6,136,893. In USP 4,369,266 a variant of the ultrafiltration process is described, allowing to obtain aqueous fluoropolymer dispersions substantially fluorinated anionic surfactant free, for example PFOA free. The process is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> based on the dialysis of the fluoropolymer dispersion and the permeate is purified from PFOA by using anionic exchange resins. This process can be industrially carried out. The drawback is that the dialysis process is slow, in particular for obtaining fluoropolymer dispersions having a very low PFOA content, lower than 10 ppm referred to the polymer weight. It is also known a process for obtaining polymeric dispersions substantially PFOA free by direct contact with anionic exchange resins of the dispersion stabilized with a nonionic surfactant. See for example USP 3,536,643, EP 1,155,055, WO 03/051988, US 2003/0220442.</p><p num="p0007">In USP 6,794,550 a process is described for obtaining dispersions substantially PFOA free by distillation of the dispersion with a pH between 1 and 3. Said process has the drawback to imply a strong destabilization of the dispersion and a high probability of coagulum formation. Furthermore there is the drawback that a remarkable foam amount is formed causing problems for the industrial process.</p><p num="p0008">The fluoropolymer dispersions obtainable by an emulsion, or microemulsion polymerization process, generally have the following characteristics:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>particle diameter from 10 nm to 400 nm, preferably from 20 nm to 300 nm;</li><li>fluoropolymer concentration from 10% to 45% by weight, preferably from 20% to 35%;</li><li>amount of fluorinated anionic surfactant in the range 800 ppm and 200,000 ppm, preferably from 1,200 ppm to 6,000 ppm referred to the polymer weight.</li></ul></p><p num="p0009">From the industrial point of view the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) dispersions obtainable by an emulsion polymerization process typically have an average particle diameter from 180 nm to 400 nm, preferably from 200 nm to 300 nm, still more preferably from 220 nm to 280 nm. The amount of<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> fluorinated anionic surfactant is from about 2,500 ppm to about 5,000 ppm, preferably from 3,000 ppm to 4,000 ppm, referred to the polymer weight. Processes to obtain polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) dispersions having a dimeter between 10 nm and 100 nm, preferably from 20 nm to 80 nm, still more preferably from 30 nm to 70 nm, for example by microemulsion polymerization, are known in the prior art. See for example USP 6,297,334. Typically said dispersions contain an amount of fluorinated anionic surfactant in the range from about 800 ppm to about 200,000 ppm, preferably from 1,200 ppm to 40,000 ppm referred to the polymer weight.</p><p num="p0010">For industrial applications, said dispersions are concentrated, for example by heating in the presence of a nonionic surfactant or by ultrafiltration, to a solid content up to 75% of fluoropolymer, see the above references.</p><p num="p0011">The Applicant has found that by using the process for obtaining polymeric dispersions substantially PFOA free by direct contact with anionic exchange resins of the dispersion stabilized with a nonionic surfactant, for example Triton® X100 and Genapol® X-080, as described in USP 3,536,643, EP 1,155,055, WO 03/051988, there is the drawback of the foam formation in the plants and in the handling and pumping lines, as well as in the ionic exchange columns in case of a process carried out in a continuous way.</p><p num="p0012">The need was therefore felt of a process to substantially remove fluorinated anionic surfactants from fluoropolymer dispersions by ionic exchange resins, without foam formation during the process.</p><p num="p0013">It has been found by the Applicant a process solving the above mentioned technical problem.</p><p num="p0014">It is an object of the present invention a process to substantially remove fluorinated anionic surfactants from fluoropolymer dispersions comprising the following steps:<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><ul list-style="bullet"><li>a) addition to the fluoropolymer dispersion of an anionic polyelectrolyte;</li><li>b) contact of the dispersion with an anionic exchanger;</li><li>c) separation of the dispersion from the anionic exchanger and recovery of the dispersion substantially fluorinated anionic surfactant free.</li></ul></p><p num="p0015">Preferably, before step a) the pH of the fluoropolymer dispersion is adjusted to a pH value in the range from 7 to 12, preferably from 8 to 10. The base used can be a strong or weak, organic or inorganic base; an inorganic base, still more preferably an ammonia aqueous solution is preferably used.</p><p num="p0016">The fluoropolymer dispersion used in the process of the present invention is obtained by an emulsion or microemulsion polymerization process. The fluoropolymer concentration is generally in the range 10%-45%, preferably 20%-35%.</p><p num="p0017">The anionic polyeletrolytes of the invention, in comparison with the nonionic surfactants, as for example Triton® X100 and Genapol® X-080, are characterized in that, during the time of the treatment of the fluoropolymer dispersion to remove the PFOA with the anionic exchange resin, do not substantially produce foam in the vessel wherein the invention process is carried out. On the contrary, when the mentioned nonionic surfactants are used, there is formation of remarkable amounts of foam making more difficult the process management.</p><p num="p0018">The polyelectrolytes are generally characterized in that they have a reduced surface activity in aqueous solutions. The last behaviour is indeed typical of polyelectrolytes differently from surfactants. The latter, e.g. nonionic surfactants, substantially reduce the surface tension of the aqueous solutions. As a matter of fact the polyelectrolytes are often used as flocculating agents of colloidal dispersions. The surfactants are instead normally used to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> stabilize colloidal dispersions.</p><p num="p0019">The value of the surface tension of the dispersions obtainable with the invention process is higher than 35 dyne/cm at 25°C, preferably higher than 40 dyne/cm, still more preferably higher than 45 dyne/cm.</p><p num="p0020">The anionic polyelectrolytes usable in step a) of the process of the present invention are anionic polymers, having a linear or branched structure, with anionic groups distributed along the polymeric chain, optionally present also in the chain end groups.
