Field of the Invention</p><p>This invention relates to compositions that are radiolabeled scintigraphic imaging agents, methods of using these compositions and methods for producing such radiolabeled compositions. Specifically, the invention relates to technetium-99m labeled scintigraphic imaging agents that are compositions of a polysulfated glycan or mixture thereof and a compound comprising a polybasic moiety covalently linked to a radiolabel binding moiety radiolabeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m). Methods and kits for making such compositions, and methods for using such compositions to image sites of infection and inflammation in a mammalian body are also provided.</p><p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p><p>There is a clinical need to be able to determine the location and/or extent of sites of focal or localized infection and inflammation. In a substantial number of cases conventional methods of diagnosis (such as physical examination, x-ray, CT and ultrasonography) fail to identify such sites (e.g., an abscess). Although biopsy may be resorted to, it is preferable to avoid such invasive procedures, at least until they are diagnostically appropriate to identify the pathogen responsible for an abscess at a known location. Identifying the site of such "occult" infection is important because rapid localization and identification of the problem is critical to effective therapeutic intervention.</p><p>In the field of nuclear medicine, certain pathological conditions can be localized or the extent of such conditions determined by imaging the internal distribution of administered radioactively-labeled tracer compounds (i.e. radiotracers or radiopharmaceuticals) that accumulate specifically at the pathological site. A variety of radionuclides are known to be useful for radioimaging, including .sup.67 Ga, .sup.99m Tc (Tc-99m), .sup.111 In, .sup.123 I, .sup.125 I, .sup.169 Yb and .sup.186 Re.</p><p>However, an abscess may be caused by any one of many possible pathogens, so that a radiotracer specific for a particular pathogen would have limited scope. On the other hand, infection is almost invariably accompanied by inflammation, which is a general response of the body to tissue injury. Therefore, a radiotracer specific for sites of inflammation would be expected to be useful in localizing sites of infection caused by any pathogen, as well as being useful for localizing other inflammatory sites.</p><p>One of the main phenomena associated with inflammation is the localization of leukocytes (white blood cells), usually monocytes and neutrophils, at the site of inflammation. A radiotracer specific for leukocytes would be useful in detecting leukocytes at the site of a localized infection. Currently approved nuclear medicine procedures for imaging sites of infection use either indium-111 labeled leukocytes (.sup.111 In-WBC) (see, e.g. Peters, 1992, J. Nucl. Med. 33: 65-67) or gallium-67 (.sup.67 Ga) citrate (see, e.g. Ebright et al., 1982, Arch. Int. Med. 142: 246-254). A major disadvantage of using .sup.111 In-labeled WBCs is that the preparation of the radiotracer requires a number of technical steps: sterile removal of autologous blood, sterile isolation of the leukocytes from the blood, sterile labeling of the leukocytes using conditions that do not damage the cells (since damaged WBC are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system when re-injected) and sterile return (re-injection) of the (now labeled) leukocytes to the patient. Furthermore, a delay of 12 to 48 hours between injection and imaging may be required to obtain optimum imaging. While Tc-99m labeled leukocytes have been used to shorten this delay period (see, e.g. Vorne et al., 1989, J. Nucl. Med. 30: 1332-1336), ex-corporeal labeling is still required. A preferred radiotracer would be one that either would label leukocyes in whole blood or would not require removal and manipulation of autologous blood components ex corpora.</p><p>Alternatively, .sup.67 Ga-citrate can be administered by intravenous injection. However, this compound is not specific for sites of infection or inflammation. Moreover, a delay of up to 72 hours is often required between injection of the radiotracer and imaging. In addition, the γ-(gamma) emissions energies of .sup.67 Ga are not well suited to conventional gamma cameras.</p><p>Radiolabeled monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against human leukocytes (including monocytes, neutrophils, granulocytes and other cell types) have been developed. Tc-99m labeled antigranulocyte monoclonal antibodies (see, e.g. Lind et al., 1990, J. Nucl. Med. 31: 417-473) and .sup.111 In-labeled non-specific human immunoglobulin (see, e.g. LaMuraglia et al., 1989, J. Vasc. Surg. 10: 20-28) have been tested for the detection of inflammation secondary to infection. .sup.111 In-labeled IgG shares the disadvantages of .sup.111 In-labeled WBC, in that 24-48 hours are required between injection and optimal imaging. In addition, radiolabeled antibodies are difficult to produce and face protracted approval procedures, as they are routinely classified as biologics by regulatory agencies.</p><p>Small, readily synthesized molecules are preferred as routinely-used radio-pharmaceuticals. There is clearly a need for small synthetic molecules that can be used either to label leukocytes in whole blood (i.e., without the need to isolate the leukocytes from the other components of whole blood) or that can be directly injected into a patient and will image sites of infection and inflammation by localizing at sites where leukocytes have accumulated.</p><p>One kind of small, readily synthesized molecule useful in such applications are peptides. The sensitivity of imaging methods using radioactively-labeled peptides is much higher than other techniques known in the art, since the specific binding of the radioactive peptide concentrates the radioactive signal over the area of interest, for example, an inflammatory site. In addition, methods for achieving high-yield chemical synthesis of small peptides are well known in the art.</p><p>Radiolabeled peptides, and in particular formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl (fMLF)-containing peptides, have been reported in the prior art.</p><p>Zoghbi et al., 1981, J. Nucl. Med. 22: 32 (Abst) disclose formyl peptide chemotactic factors (fMLF) derived from bacteria coupled to .sup.111 In-labeled transferrin.</p><p>Jiang et al., 1982, Nuklearmedizin 21: 110-113 disclose a chemotactic formylated peptide (fMLF) radiolabeled with .sup.125 I.</p><p>Fischman et al., 1991, J. Nucl. Med. 32: 482-491 relates to chemotactic formyl peptide (fMLF)--.sup.111 In-labeled DTPA conjugates.</p><p>EPC 90108734.6 relates to chemotactic formyl peptide (fMLF)--.sup.111 In-labeled DTPA conjugates.</p><p>U.S. Pat.

Top. Cell. Reg. 17: 137-170), and at sufficient doses these compounds can cause leukocytopenia (Jiang et al., 1982, Nuklearmed. 21: 110-113).</p><p>Another source of inflammatory site-specific peptides is platelet factor 4, a naturally-occurring chemotactic peptide, consisting of 70 amino acids having a molecular weight of 7800 daltons and known in the prior art to bind to neutrophils and monocytes, cell types known to be associated with sites of inflammation and infection in vivo. Of interest with regard to the present invention, the carboxyl terminus of PF4 is known to bind to polysulfated glycans such as heparin (Loscalzo et al., 1985, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 240: 446-455). In addition, an advantage of PF4 over the fMLF compounds known in the art is that it does not cause superoxide release from neutrophils even at concentrations of 20 μM (Bebawy et al., 1986, J.

The compositions of the invention accumulate at sites of inflammation in vivo. The reagents comprising the compositions of the invention are themselves comprised of polybasic compounds that are capable of specifically localizing at sites of infection or inflammation or components thereof, wherein said compounds are covalently linked to radioisotope, preferably technetium-99m, binding moieties.</p><p>It has unexpectedly been found that the combination of a Tc-99m radiolabeled polybasic compound and a polysulfated glycan as provided by the present invention advantageously enables the acquisition of scintigraphic images of focal sites of infection and inflammation in vivo. Administration of this combination results in a greater degree of localization of the Tc-99m radioactive signal at the site of infection when compared to administration of the Tc-99m labeled polybasic compound alone. As a result, such scintigraphic images produced by this combination are superior to the images obtained using Tc-99m labeled scintigraphic imaging agents comprising the radiolabeled polybasic compound alone (see Example 3 and Table II hereinbelow). Higher ratios of the detected radioactivity at infection site versus blood and infection site versus normal tissue are also found using the compositions of the invention compared with the radiolabeled compounds alone.</p><p>Accordingly, the invention provides radiolabeled compositions that accumulate at sites of inflammation in vivo, methods for preparing such compositions, and methods for using such radiolabeled compositions for imaging sites of infection and inflammation within a mammalian body.</p><p>In a first aspect of the present invention, scintigraphic imaging agents for imaging sites of inflammation within a mammalian body are provided, comprising compositions that comprise a technetium-99m labeled reagent having a molecular weight of about 500 daltons to about 15,000 daltons and having at least 5 residues that are basic at physiological pH, covalently linked to a technetium-99m binding moiety, the composition further comprising a polysulfated glycan having a molecular weight of at least about 1000 daltons, wherein the reagent is radioactively labeled with technetium-99m, and wherein the composition is capable of accumulating at sites of inflammation in vivo.

Methods for radiolabeling these reagents with Tc-99m are also provided. Radiolabeled complexes provided by the invention are formed by reacting the reagents of the invention with Tc-99m in the presence of a reducing agent. Preferred reducing agents include but are not limited to dithionite ion, stannous ion and ferrous ion. Complexes of the invention are also formed by labeling by ligand exchange of a prereduced Tc-99m complex as provided herein.</p><p>The invention also provides kits for preparing scintigraphic imaging agents that are a composition comprising a polysulfated glycan and Tc-99m labeled reagents of the invention. Kits for preparing the scintigraphic imaging agents of the invention, wherein the radiolabel is Tc-99m, are comprised of a first sealed vial containing a predetermined quantity of an unlabeled embodiment of a reagent of the invention and a sufficient amount of reducing agent to label the reagent with technetium-99m, and a second sealed vial containing a predetermined quantity of the polysulfated glycan of the invention.

This radiolabeled whole blood mixture is then administered to an animal such as a human being having or suspected of having a site of inflammation in vivo, and the radioactive signal detected to localize the site of inflammation as described herein.

The reagents of the compositions of the invention comprise polybasic compounds that are covalently linked to a radiolabel binding moiety wherein the radiolabel binding moiety binds a radioisotope. For the purposes of this invention, the term "polybasic compound" is intended to encompass chemical compounds having at least 5 chemical functionalities that are basic and are cationic at physiological pH (i.e. about pH 7+-5), for example but not limited to, primary amines, whereby said polybasic compounds are polycationic at physiological pH. Polysulfated glycans of the invention include but are not limited to heparin, heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate or derivatives thereof.</p><p>The compositions of this invention specifically localize to sites of inflammation. These compositions may also bind to leukocytes, preferably monocytes and neutrophils and most preferably to neutrophils. For purposes of this invention, the term "bind to leukocytes" is intended to mean that the compositions of the invention are capable of accumulating at sites of infection or inflammation in mammalian body sufficient to allow detection of the accumulation of radiolabeled complexes prepared from the compositions as disclosed herein at sites of infection or inflammation by gamma scintigraphy.</p><p>In peptide embodiments of the scintigraphic imaging agents of the invention, preferred peptides include platelet factor 4 and peptides derived therefrom. For purposes of this invention, the term "peptides derived therefrom" is intended to encompass peptides having an amino acid sequence homologous to all or a portion of the platelet factor 4 amino acid sequence. Also intended to be circumscribed by this term are peptide fragments of platelet factor 4, whether generated by proteolytic degradation of native platelet factor 4 protein or by chemical synthesis of a portion of the platelet factor 4 amino acid sequence. Peptide fragments useful in the practice of this invention include those fragments capable of accumulating at sites of infection and inflammation in a mammalian body. Examples of such peptides are presented hereinafter in the Examples.</p><p>In Cp(aa)Cp-containing scintigraphic imaging agents, where Cp is a protected cysteine the S-protecting groups are the same or different and may be but not limited to:</p><p>--CH.sub.2 -aryl (aryl is phenyl or alkyl or alkyloxy substituted phenyl);</p><p>--CH-(aryl).sub.2, (aryl is phenyl or alkyl or alkyloxy substituted phenyl);</p><p>--C-(aryl).sub.3, (aryl is phenyl or alkyl or alkyloxy substituted phenyl);</p><p>--CH.sub.2 -(4-methoxyphenyl);</p><p>--CH-(4-pyridyl)(phenyl).sub.2 ;</p><p>--C(CH.sub.3).sub.3</p><p>-9-phenylfluorenyl;</p><p>--CH.sub.2 NHCOR (R is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or aryl);</p><p>--CH.sub.2 --NHCOOR (R is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or aryl);</p><p>--CONHR (R is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or aryl);</p><p>--CH.sub.2 --S--CH.sub.2 -phenyl.</p><p>Radiolabel binding moieties comprising cysteine-sulfur protecting groups designated "(pgp).sup.S ", such as the bisamino, bisthiol moieties of the invention, are also described by the above-mentioned listing of protecting groups.</p><p>The preferred protecting group has the formula --CH.sub.2 --NHCOR wherein R is a lower alkyl having 1 and 8 carbon atoms, phenyl or phenyl-substituted with lower alkyl, hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, carboxy, or lower alkoxycarbonyl.</p><p>Labeling with Tc-99m is an advantage of the present invention because the nuclear and radioactive properties of this isotope make it an ideal component of a scintigraphic imaging agent. This isotope has a single photon energy of 140 keV and a radioactive half-life of about 6 hours, and is readily available from a .sup.99 Mo-.sup.99m Tc generator. Other radionuclides known in the prior art have effective half-lives which are much longer (for example, .sup.111 In, which has a half-life of 67.4 h) or are toxic (for example, .sup.125 I).</p><p>Each polybasic peptide-containing embodiment of the invention is comprised of a sequence of amino acids. The term amino acid as used in this invention is intended to include all L- and D- amino acids, naturally occurring and otherwise. Reagents comprising polybasic peptides provided by the invention include but are not limited to the following (the amino acids in the following peptides are L-amino acids except where otherwise indicated):</p><p>acetyl-KC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm QAPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:1)</p><p>acetyl-KKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm QAPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:2)</p><p>acetyl-KKKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm QAPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:3)</p><p>acetyl-KKKKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm QAPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:4)</p><p>acetyl-KKKKKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm QAPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:5)</p><p>acetyl-KC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm GGPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:6)</p><p>acetyl-KKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm GGPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:7)</p><p>acetyl-KKKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm GGPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:8)</p><p>acetyl-KKKKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm GGPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:9)</p><p>acetyl-KKKKKC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm GGPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:10)</p><p>acetyl-KKKKKKCGCGGPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:11)</p><p>acetyl-KKKKKK.[BAT].GGPLYKKIIKKLLES (SEQ ID No.:12).</p><p>Polybasic peptide embodiments of the present invention may be chemically synthesized in vitro. Peptides of the present invention can generally advantageously be prepared on a peptide synthesizer. The peptides of this invention can be synthesized wherein the radiolabel binding moiety is covalently linked to the peptide during chemical in vitro synthesis, using techniques well known to those with skill in the art. Such peptides covalently-linked to the radiolabel binding moiety upon synthesis are advantageous because specific sites of covalent linkage can be determined therein.</p><p>Radiolabel binding moieties of the invention may be introduced into the target specific polybasic peptide during peptide synthesis. For embodiments [e.g., Pic-Gly-Cys(protecting group)-] comprising picolinic acid (Pic-), the radiolabel-binding moiety can be synthesized as the last (i.e., amino-terminal) residue in the synthesis. In addition, the picolinic acid-containing radiolabel-binding moiety may be covalently linked to the ε-amino group of lysine to give, for example, αN(Fmoc)-Lys-εN[Pic-Gly-Cys(protecting group)], which may be incorporated at any position in the peptide chain. This sequence is particularly advantageous as it affords an easy mode of incorporation into the target binding peptide.</p><p>Similarly, the picolylamine (Pica)-containing radiolabel-binding moiety [-Cys(protecting group)-Gly-Pica] can be prepared during peptide synthesis by including the sequence [-Cys(protecting group)-Gly-] at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide chain. Following cleavage of the peptide from the resin the carboxyl terminus of the peptide is activated and coupled to picolylamine. This synthetic route requires that reactive side-chain functionalities remain masked (protected) and do not react during the conjugation of the picolylamine.</p><p>This invention provides for the incorporation of these chelators into virtually any platelet factor 4-derived peptide, resulting in Tc-99m radiolabeled peptide components of the scintigraphic imaging agents of the invention.</p><p>This invention also provides polybasic, small, synthetic compounds which incorporate bisamine bisthiol (BAT) chelators which may be labeled with Tc-99m.</p><p>In forming a complex of radioactive technetium-99m with the reagents of this invention, the technetium complex, preferably a salt of Tc-99m pertechnetate, is reacted with the imaging agent in the presence of a reducing agent; in a preferred embodiment, the reducing agent is stannous chloride. Complexes and means for preparing such complexes are conveniently provided in a kit form comprising a first sealed vial containing a predetermined quantity of a reagent of the invention that is to be labeled and a sufficient amount of reducing agent to label the reagent with Tc-99m. Alternatively, the complex may be formed by reacting a reagent of the invention with a pre-formed labile complex of technetium and another compound known as a transfer ligand. This process is known as ligand exchange and is well known to those skilled in the art. The labile complex may be formed using such transfer ligands as tartrate, citrate, gluconate or mannitol, for example. Among the Tc-99m pertechnetate salts useful with the present invention are included the alkali metal salts such as the sodium salt, or ammonium salts or lower alkyl ammonium salts. Using either embodiment, the vial containing the unlabeled reagent and reducing agent can also advantageously contain the polysulfated glycan components of the compositions of the invention. The reaction of the scintigraphic imaging agents of this invention with Tc-99m pertechnetate or preformed Tc-99m labile complex can be carried out in an aqueous medium at room temperature. When an anionic complex is formed in an aqueous medium, the radiolabeled complex is in the form of a salt with a suitable cation such as sodium cation, ammonium cation, mono, di- or tri-lower alkyl amine cation, or any pharmaceutically acceptable cation.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a kit for preparing technetium-99m labeled peptides is provided. The peptide embodiments of the reagents of the invention can be chemically synthesized using methods and means well-known to those with skill in the art and described hereinbelow. An appropriate amount of such a reagent is introduced into a vial containing a reducing agent, such as stannous chloride or a solid-phase reducing agent, in an amount sufficient to label the agent with Tc-99m. An appropriate amount of a transfer ligand as described (such as tartrate, citrate, gluconate or mannitol, for example) can also be included. Technetium-99m labeled reagents according to the present invention can be prepared by the addition of an appropriate amount of Tc-99m or Tc-99m complex into the vials and reaction under conditions described in Example 2 hereinbelow. Said kits also comprise a second sealed vial containing an appropriate amount of a polysulfated glycan. Examples of efficacious polysulfated glycans include but are not limited to heparin, heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate or derivatives thereof. Tc-99m labeled scintigraphic imaging agents of the invention can be prepared by mixing the Tc-99m labeled polybasic component from the first vial with the polysulfated glycan from the second vial.</p><p>Radioactively labeled scintigraphic imaging agents provided by the present invention are provided having a suitable amount of radioactivity. In forming the Tc-99m radioactive complexes, it is generally preferred to form radioactive complexes in solutions containing radioactivity at concentrations of from about 0.01 millicurie (mCi) to 100 mCi per ml.</p><p>Compositions comprising scintigraphic imaging agents comprised of technetium-99m labeled reagents and polysulfated glycans provided by this invention can be used for visualizing sites of inflammation, including abscesses and sites of "occult" infection. The Tc-99m labeled compositions can also be used for visualizing sites of inflammation caused by tissue ischemia, including such disorders as inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. In accordance with this invention, the technetium-99m labeled compositions, wherein the reagents are provided either as a complex or as a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion, are administered in a single unit injectable dose. Any of the common carriers known to those with skill in the art, such as sterile saline solution or plasma, can be utilized after radiolabeling for preparing the injectable solution to diagnostically image various organs, tumors and the like in accordance with this invention. Generally, the unit dose to be administered has a radioactivity of about 0.01 mCi to about 100 mCi, preferably 1 mCi to 20 mCi. The composition to be injected at unit dosage is from about 0.01 ml to about 10 ml. After intravenous administration, imaging of the organ or tumor in vivo can take place in a matter of a few minutes. However, imaging can take place, if desired, in hours or even longer, after injecting into patients. In most instances, a sufficient amount of the administered dose will accumulate in the area to be imaged within about 0.5 of an hour to permit the taking of scintiphotos. Any conventional method of scintigraphic imaging for diagnostic purposes can be utilized in accordance with this invention.</p><p>The technetium-99m labeled compositions of the invention may be administered intravenously in any conventional medium for intravenous injection such as an aqueous saline medium, or in blood plasma medium. Such medium may also contain conventional pharmaceutical adjunct materials such as, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts to adjust the osmotic pressure, buffers, preservatives and the like. Among the preferred media are normal saline and plasma.</p><p>Alternatively, the invention provides methods for specifically radiolabeling whole blood and using such radiolabeled whole blood to image sites of inflammation within a mammalian body. In this embodiment of the invention, whole blood is mixed with an amount, from about 1 microgram to 100 milligrams, of a polysulfated glycan to form a mixture. Then an amount, from about 1 microgram to 100 milligrams, of a radiolabeled, preferably Tc-99m labeled, composition of matter that is a reagent comprising a polybasic moitey covalently linked to a radiolabel binding moiety, is added to form a radiolabeled mixture. This radiolabeled whole blood mixture is then administered to an animal such as a human being having or suspected of having a site of inflammation in uivo, and the radioactive signal detected to localize the site of inflammation as described herein. The requirement for antigenically-compatible, preferably but not necessarily autologous, heparinized whole blood to be used in this embodiment of the experiment will be understood by those skilled in the art.</p><p>The methods for making and labeling these compositions are more fully illustrated in the following Examples.

New Zealand white rabbits were innoculated intramuscularly in the left calf with a potent strain of Escherichia coli.

The animals were then injected intravenously with Tc-99m labeled peptide (≦150 μg peptide/2-10 mCi Tc-99m) alone or in a solution that contained 30 U.S.P. Units/mL heparin. The animals were positioned supine in the field of view of a gamma camera (LEAP collimator, photopeaked for Tc-99m) and imaged over the first hour post-injection, and then at approximately lh intervals over the following 3 h or 13 h.
