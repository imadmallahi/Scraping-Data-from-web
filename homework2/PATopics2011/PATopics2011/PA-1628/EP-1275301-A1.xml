preparation, their use as fungicides, particularly in the form of fungicidal
compositions, and methods for the control of phytopathogenic fungi of plants using
these compounds or their compositions.</p><p num="0002">From the literature, substituted heterocycles with fungicidal action are
known. Thus, substituted heterocycles, disclosed in particular in patent application
WO-A2-01/05769 and by M. Shimano et al. (<i>Tetrahedron Lett.</i> 1998, 12745-12774),
are presented as being effective against phytopathogenic fungi of plants. These
compounds, and also those disclosed in patent WO-A2-01/143339, only present
heterocycles that are substituted in an adjacent manner by a) amide, b) hydroxy (or a
processor thereof and c) eventually an alkoxy (or thioalkoxy) radical.</p><p num="0003">Patent application WO-A-00/26191 presents picolinamide derivatives that are
optionally substituted in position 4 with a methoxy radical. Patent application
WO-A-95/25723 proposes 3-pyridylcarboxylic acid derivatives.</p><p num="0004">Picolinamide derivatives are also known from patent application publication
JP-11 228 542. These derivatives are presented as having potential antifungal
activities and low toxicity, for use in pharmaceutical products. Other picolinic acid
derivatives are also known from patent application EP-A-0 690 061, in which such
compounds are used as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of
pyridothiadiazoles.</p><p num="0005">A first object of the present invention is to propose a new family of
compounds having an improved activity, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in
comparison with the known fungicides, antimycin or derivatives. By activity, is
meant fungicidal activity; by quantitative improvement, is understood a better control 
of phytopathogenic fungi on plants and, by qualitative improvement, a broader
spectrum of activity, that is to say control of a greater variety of phytopathogenic
fungi of plants.</p><p num="0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide a new family of
compounds having a reduced toxicity and/or phytotoxicity and/or ecotoxicity in
comparison with known fungicides, particularly antimycin and its derivatives as well
as the compounds disclosed in the above mentioned patents.</p><p num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a new family of
substituted heterocycles possessing the characteristics indicated above, notably on
crops such as cereals, rice, corn, fruit trees, woodland trees, vine, oil-yielding plants,
protein-yielding plants, market garden plants, solanaceous plants, beet, flax, citrus
fruits, banana and ornamental plants and tobacco.</p><p num="0008">Another object of the present invention consists equally in proposing a new
family of substituted heterocycles useful for the treatment and protection of lumber
against fungal disease. In effect, lumber used for example for the fabrication of
buildings and furniture (framework, walls, ceilings, flooring etc.), may suffer
different injuries, among others, due to phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds
according to the present invention allow these attacks to be combated.</p><p num="0009">Another object of the present invention comprises proposing a new family of
substituted heterocycles useful in human and animal therapy. In fact, by virtue of
their antifungal properties, heterocyclic salicylic acid derivatives which are the object
of the present invention can prove useful for the treatment, in man and animals, of
fungal diseases, such as for example mycosis and candidiasis.</p><p num="0010">Surprisingly it has been found that these objects can be achieved in whole or
in part, by substituted heterocycles such as those described in the present invention. </p><heading><b><u style="single">General definition of the invention</u></b></heading><p num="0011">The invention relates to substituted heterocycles of general formula (I):

used as intermediates in the processes of preparation, and which will be defined in
the description of these processes, can exist in one or more forms of geometrical
isomers according to the number of double bonds in the compound. As an example,
compounds of general formula (I) where Q<sup>1</sup> is -NR<sup>1</sup> or -N-NR<sub>4</sub>R<sup>5</sup> can comprise 2
different geometrical isomers denoted (<i>E</i>) or (<i>Z</i>) depending on the configuration of
the two double bonds. The <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> notation can be replaced, respectively, by the
term "syn" and "anti", or "cis" and "trans". Reference is made particularly to the
work of E. Eliel and S. Wilen "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", published
by Wiley (1994), for the description and use of these notations.</p><p num="0035">The compounds of general formula (I) and compounds which may be used as
intermediates in the processes of preparation, and which will be defined in the
description of the processes, can exist in one or more optical isomeric or chiral forms
according to the number of asymmetric centres in the compound. The invention thus
also relates to all the optical isomers and their racemic or scalemic (scalemic
designates a mixture of enantiomers in different proportions), as well as the mixtures
of all possible stereoisomers in all proportions, including the racemic mixture. The
separation of the diastereoisomers and/or optical isomers can be effected by known
methods (E. Eliel <i>ibid</i>.).</p><p num="0036">The invention also relates to fungicidal compositions comprising an effective
amount of at least one active material of formula (I). The fungicidal compositions
according to the invention comprise, besides the active material of formula (I),
agriculturally acceptable solid or liquid supports and/or surfactants that are also
agriculturally acceptable. In particular, common inert supports and common
surfactants can be used. These compositions include not only compositions which are
ready to be applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device,
such as a spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions
which must be diluted before they are applied to the crop. </p><p num="0037">These fungicidal compositions according to the invention can also contain
other ingredients of any kind, such as, for example, protective colloids, adhesives,
thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents,
etc. More generally, the active materials can be combined with any solid or liquid
additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.</p><p num="0038">In general, the compositions according to the invention usually contain from
0.05 to 99% (by weight) of active material, one or more solid or liquid supports and,
optionally, one or more surfactants.</p><p num="0039">In the present specification, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic,
organic or inorganic material with which the active material is combined to make it
easier to apply to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and
should be agriculturally acceptable. The support can be solid (clays, natural or
synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, etc.) or liquid (water,
alcohols, in particular butanol, etc., organic solvents, mineral and plant oils and
derivatives thereof). Mixtures of such supports may also be used.</p><p num="0040">The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of
ionic or nonionic type or a mixture of such surfactants. Mention may be made, for
example, of polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or
naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty
alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular
alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives
(in particular alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or
phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the above compounds
containing sulphate, sulphonate and phosphate functions. The presence of at least one
surfactant is generally essential when the active material and/or the inert support are
water-insoluble and when the vector agent for the application is water.</p><p num="0041">Thus, the compositions for agricultural use according to the invention can
contain the active material in a very wide range, from 0.05% to 99% (by weight). 
Their surfactant content is advantageously between 5% and 40% by weight. Except
where otherwise indicated, the percentages given in this description are weight
percentages.</p><p num="0042">These compositions according to the invention are themselves in quite
diverse, solid or liquid forms. As solid composition forms, mention may be made of
powders for dusting (with an active material content which can be up to 100%) and
granules, in particular those obtained by extrusion, by atomisation, by compacting,
by impregnation of a granulated support or by granulation from a powder (the active
material content in these granules being between 0.5 and 80% for the latter cases).</p><p num="0043">The fungicidal compositions according to the invention can also be used in
the form of powders for dusting; compositions comprising 50 g of active material
and 950 g of talc can also be used; compositions comprising 20 g of active material,
10 g of finely divided silica and 970 g of talc can also be used; these constituents are
mixed together and ground and the mixture is applied by dusting.</p><p num="0044">As liquid composition forms or forms intended to constitute liquid
compositions when applied, mention may be made of solutions, in particular
water-soluble concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, concentrated
suspensions and wettable powders (or powders for spraying).</p><p num="0045">The concentrated suspensions, which can be applied by spraying, are
prepared so as to obtain a stable fluid product which does not become deposited and
which gives good bioavailability of the active material(s). These suspensions usually
contain from 5% to 75% of active material, preferably from 10% to 25%, from 0.5%
to 75% of surfactants, preferably from 5% to 50%, from 0% to 10% of suitable
additives, such as thickeners of organic or mineral origin, antifoaming agents,
corrosion inhibitors, adhesives, preserving agents, such as, for example, Proxel
GXL®, antifreezes and, as support, water or an organic liquid in which the active
material is insoluble or only sparingly soluble: certain organic solid materials or
mineral salts may be dissolved in the support to help prevent sedimentation or as 
antifreezes for the water. In certain cases, and in particular for formulations intended
for treating seeds, one or more colorants may be added.</p><p num="0046">For foliar applications, the choice of surfactants is paramount for obtaining
good bioavailability of the active material(s); thus, a combination of a surfactant of
hydrophilic nature (HLB&gt;10) and a surfactant of lipophilic nature (HLB&lt;5) will
preferably be used. Such combinations of surfactants are disclosed, for example, in
the yet unpublished French patent No. 00/04015.</p><p num="0047">By way of example, here are 3 possible formulations of concentrated
suspension type that are suitable for various crops:</p><heading><b>Example CS 1</b> (in g/kg):</heading><p num="0048">This example is rather suited for monocotyledon crops (cereals, rice, etc.)

formulations: The surfactants selected (surfactant of hydrophilic nature + surfactant
of lipophilic nature + ethoxylated tristyrylphenol phosphate) are mixed with the
required amount of water, using a turbo mixer; after homogenisation, the other
constituents of the formulation apart from the active material are then mixed
together.</p><p num="0052">Next, the active material and optionally the thickener of mineral origin
(Aerosol 200 and Attagel 50) are added to give a medium of viscous consistency.
The mixture obtained is then ground using a turbo mixer mill at high speed and then
a ball mill until a D50 of about 1 to 3 µm and a D90 of between 3 and 8 µm are
obtained. When no thickener of mineral origin is used, the thickener of natural origin
(Rhodopol G) is then added and the mixture is stirred until a suitable viscosity is
obtained. </p><p num="0053">The wettable powders (or powders for spraying) are usually prepared such that
they contain 20 to 95% of active material, and they usually contain, in addition to the
solid support, from 0 to 30% of a wetting agent, from 3 to 20% of a dispersing agent
and, when necessary, from 0.1 to 10% of one or more stabilisers and/or other additives,
such as penetration agents, adhesives, anticaking agents, dyes, etc.</p><p num="0054">In order to obtain the powders for spraying or wettable powders, the active
materials are intimately mixed with the additional substances in suitable mixers and are
ground with mills or other suitable blenders. Powders for spraying with advantageous
wettability and suspension formation are thus obtained; they can be placed in
suspension with water at any desired concentration and these suspensions can be used
very advantageously, in particular for application, for example, to plant leaves or to
seeds.</p><p num="0055">By way of example, there follow various wettable powder compositions (or

by diluting a wettable powder according to the invention with water, are included
within the general scope of the present invention. The emulsions can be of the
water-in-oil or oil-in-water type and they can have a thick consistency, such as that of a
"mayonnaise".</p><p num="0062">The fungicidal compositions according to the invention can be formulated in the
form of water-dispersible granules, which are also included within the scope of the
invention. These dispersible granules, with an apparent density generally of between
about 0.3 and about 0.6, have a particle size generally of between about 150 and about
2000 and preferably between 300 and 1500 microns.</p><p num="0063">The active material content of these granules is generally between about 1% and
about 90% and preferably between 25% and 90%. The rest of the granule is essentially
composed of a solid support and optionally of surfactant adjuvants, which give the 
granule water-dispersibility properties. These granules can be essentially of two
different types depending on whether the support selected is soluble or insoluble in
water. When the support is water-soluble, it can be inorganic or, preferably, organic.
Excellent results have been obtained with urea. In the case of an insoluble support, it is
preferably inorganic, for example such as kaolin or bentonite. It is then advantageously
accompanied by surfactants (in a proportion of from 2 to 20% by weight of the granule)
more than half of which consists, for example, of at least one dispersant, which is
essentially anionic, such as an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal polynaphthalene
sulphonate or an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal lignosulphonate, the remainder
consisting of nonionic or anionic wetting agents such as an alkali metal or alkaline-earth
metal alkylnaphthalene sulphonate. Moreover, although this is not essential, other
adjuvants can be added, such as antifoaming agents.</p><p num="0064">The granule according to the invention can be prepared by mixing together the
required ingredients, followed by granulation according to several techniques, which
are known per se (granulator, fluid bed, sprayer, extrusion, etc.). The process generally
ends by a crushing operation, followed by an operation of screening to the particle size
chosen within the limits mentioned above. Granules obtained as above and then
impregnated with a composition containing the active material can also be used.</p><p num="0065">Preferably, it is obtained by extrusion, by performing the process as indicated in
the examples below.</p><heading><b>Example DG1:</b> Dispersible granules</heading><p num="0066">90% by weight of active material and 10% of urea pellets are mixed together in a mixer.
The mixture is then ground in a toothed roll crusher. A powder is obtained, which is
moistened with about 8% by weight of water. The wet powder is extruded in a
perforated-roller extruder. A granulate is obtained, which is dried and then crushed and
screened, so as to retain, respectively, only the granules between 150 and 2000 microns
in size.</p><heading><b>Example DG2:</b> Dispersible granules</heading><p num="0067">The constituents below are mixed together in a mixer: <ul list-style="bullet"><li>Active material   75%</li><li>Wetting agent (sodium alkylnaphthalene sulphonate)   2%</li><li>Dispersant (polysodium naphthalene sulphonate)   8%</li><li>Water-insoluble inert filler (kaolin)   15%</li></ul></p><p num="0068">This mixture is granulated in a fluid bed, in the presence of water, and then dried,
crushed and screened so as to obtain granules between 0.15 and 0.80 mm in size.</p><p num="0069">These granules can be used alone, or as a solution or dispersion in water so as to
obtain the desired dose. They can also be used to prepare combinations with other
active materials, in particular fungicides, these being in the form of wettable powders,
granules or aqueous suspensions.</p><p num="0070">The compounds of the invention can also be mixed with one or more
insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, attractant acaricides or pheromones or other
compounds with biological activity. The mixtures thus obtained have a broadened
spectrum of activity. In particular the compounds of the present invention do not
exhibit the problem of cross-resistance with strobilurin derivatives. In fact, the
compounds of the present invention are active on a different biochemical site to
strobilurin derivatives.</p><p num="0071">The mixtures with other fungicides are particularly advantageous, especially

preventively combating the phytopathogenic fungi of crops, characterised in that an
effective (agronomically effective) and non-phytotoxic amount of an active material of
formula (I), preferably in the form of a fungicidal composition according to the
invention, is applied to the plant seeds or to the plant leaves and/or to the fruits of the

symptom of phytotoxicity for the said crops. Such an amount can vary within a wide
range depending on the fungus to be combated, the type of crop, the climatic conditions
and the compounds included in the fungicidal composition according to the invention.
This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the
capabilities of a person skilled in the art. </p><p num="0074">Lastly, the invention relates to a process for preventively or curatively
protecting plant multiplication products, as well as the plants resulting therefrom,
against fungal diseases, characterised in that the said products are coated with an

application techniques are well known to those skilled in the art and they may be
used without a drawback in the context of the present invention. Mention may be
made, for example, of film cladding or coating. Among the plant multiplication

modified plants comprising a heterologous gene, which gives the plant
disease-resistance properties. The heterologous gene preferentially gives the
