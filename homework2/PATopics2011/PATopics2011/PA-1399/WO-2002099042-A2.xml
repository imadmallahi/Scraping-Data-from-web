The contents of the prior applications are hereby incorporated in their entirety.</p><p num="p0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0005">The p53 gene is mutated in over 50 different types of human cancers, including familial and spontaneous cancers, and is believed to be the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer (Zambetti and Levine, FASEB (1993) 7:855-865; Hollstein, et al, Nucleic Acids Res. (1994) 22:3551-3555). Greater than 90% of mutations in the p53 gene are missense mutations that alter a single amino acid that inactivates p53 function. Aberrant forms of human p53 are associated with poor prognosis, more aggressive tumors, metastasis, and short survival rates (Mitsudomi et al., Clin Cancer Res 2000 Oct; 6(10):4055-63; Koshland, Science (1993) 262:1953).</p><p num="p0006">The human p53 protein normally functions as a central integrator of signals including DNA damage, hypoxia, nucleotide deprivation, and oncogene activation (Prives, Cell (1998) 95:5-8). In response to these signals, p53 protein levels are greatly increased with the result that the accumulated p53 activates cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the nature and strength of these signals. Indeed, multiple lines of experimental evidence have pointed to a key role for p53 as a tumor suppressor (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331). For example, homozygous p53 "knockout" mice are developmentally normal but exhibit nearly 100% incidence of neoplasia in the first year of life (Donehower et al, Nature (1992) 356:215-221).</p><p num="p0007">The biochemical mechanisms and pathways through which p53 functions in normal and cancerous cells are not fully understood, but one clearly important aspect of p53 function is its activity as a gene-specific transcriptional activator. Among the genes with known p53-response elements are several with well-characterized roles in either regulation of the cell cycle or apoptosis, including GADD45, p21/Wafl/Cipl, cyclin G, Bax, IGF- BP3, and MDM2 (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331).</p><p num="p0008">Cell-cell interactions that involve adhesion molecules are important in many developmental processes. Many adhesion molecules have been found to be conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates, indicating that these adhesion molecules are involved

in tissue morphogenesis evolved long before the divergence of the arthropods and chordates (Dunne, J. et al (1995) Genomics 30: 207-223) (Hortsch, M. and Goodman, C. (1991) Ann. Rev. Cell. Biol. 7: 505-557). Adhesion molecules have been classified into four major families: the immunoglobulin superfamily, the integrin superfamily, the selectin family, and the cadherin superfamily. Cadherins mediate homophilic, calcium- dependent cell-cell adhesion in a wide variety of tissues and are important in regulating morphogenesis. Loss of function may be play a role in the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. The original or classical adherins have a highly conserved domain structure, which typically includes five extracellular conserved repeated amino acid sequences (cadherin repeats).</p><p num="p0009">The Drosophila 'fat' gene does not belong to the classical cadherin gene family, however it does encode a transmembrane protein containing 34 cadherin repeats in association with a number of other motifs (Mahoney, P. et al. (1991) Cell 67: 853-868). The Drosophila 'fat' locus encodes a tumor suppressor gene, and recessive (loss-of- function) mutations which lead to hyperplastic overgrowth of the imaginal discs, indicating that contact-dependent cell interactions may play an important role in regulating growth (Bryant, P. et al. (1988) Dev. Biol. 129: 541-554). This excessive cell proliferation occurs while maintaining normal epithelial organization and differentiation potential. Cadherin related 23 (CDH23or CAD23) is a protein with a single transmembrane domain and 27 cadherin repeats, is involved in sensorineural hearing and vestibular function, and gene mutations often cause Usher syndrome type ID (USH1D), which is characterized by hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction and visual impairment (Bolz, H. et al. (2001) Nat Genet (1): 108-12). Mutations in the mouse ortholog cause disorganization of inner ear stereocilia and deafness in the waltzer mouse (Di Palma, F. et al. (2001) Nat Genet. 2001 (1): 103-7).</p><p num="p0010">FAT tumor suppressor precursor (CAD7) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, and possibly functions in developmental processes and cell communication (Dunne et al, supra). The full-length human FAT cDNA encodes a large protein that most resembles the Drosophila 'fat' protein in its possession of 34 cadherin repeats and other characteristics (Dunne, J. et al. (1995) supra). Expression analysis of FAT in fetal and adult tissues revealed that FAT mRNA is present in many epithelial and some endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The large FAT protein is predicted to contain nearly 4600 residues.

 FAT2 is a protein containing multiple cadherin domains, has four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and two extracellular la inin G domains (Wu, Q. and Maniatis, T. (2000) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 97: 3124-3129). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is characterized by domains of approximately 50 amino acids with three disulfide bonds. EGF-like domains are thought to be involved in a number of extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often contain more than 1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and contain additional domains known to be involved in specific protein-protein interactions. FAT2 is expressed in the brain and has and contains sequence similarity to the rat gene MEGF1 (Nakayama, M. et al. (1998) Genomics 51: 27-34).</p><p num="p0011">The ability to manipulate the genomes of model organisms such as Drosophila provides a powerful means to analyze biochemical processes that, due to significant evolutionary conservation, have direct relevance to more complex vertebrate organisms. Due to a high level of gene and pathway conservation, the strong similarity of cellular processes, and the functional conservation of genes between these model organisms and mammals, identification of the involvement of novel genes in particular pathways and their functions in such model organisms can directly contribute to the understanding of the correlative pathways and methods of modulating them in mammals (see, for example, Mechler BM et al., 1985 EMBO J 4:1551-1557; Gateff E. 1982 Adv. Cancer Res. 37: 33- 74; Watson KL., et al., 1994 J Cell Sci. 18: 19-33; Miklos GL, and Rubin GM. 1996 Cell 86:521-529; Wassarman DA, et al., 1995 Curr Opin Gen Dev 5: 44-50; and Booth DR. 1999 Cancer Metastasis Rev. 18: 261-284). For example, a genetic screen can be carried out in an invertebrate model organism having underexpression (e.g. knockout) or overexpression of a gene (referred to as a "genetic entry point") that yields a visible phenotype. Additional genes are mutated in a random or targeted manner. When a gene mutation changes the original phenotype caused by the mutation in the genetic entry point, the gene is identified as a "modifier" involved in the same or overlapping pathway as the genetic entry point. When the genetic entry point is an ortholog of a human gene implicated in a disease pathway, such as p53, modifier genes can be identified that may be attractive candidate targets for novel therapeutics.</p><p num="p0012">All references cited herein, including sequence information in referenced Genbank identifier numbers and website references, are incorporated herein in their entireties.

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0013">We have discovered genes that modify the p53 pathway in Drosophila, and identified their human orthologs, hereinafter referred to as CAD. The invention provides methods for utilizing these p53 modifier genes and polypeptides to identify candidate therapeutic agents that can be used in the treatment of disorders associated with defective p53 function. Preferred CAD-modulating agents specifically bind to CAD polypeptides and restore p53 function. Other preferred CAD-modulating agents are nucleic acid modulators such as antisense oligomers and RNAi that repress CAD gene expression or product activity by, for example, binding to and inhibiting the respective nucleic acid (i.e. DNA or mRNA).</p><p num="p0014">CAD-specific modulating agents may be evaluated by any convenient in vitro or in vivo assay for molecular interaction with a CAD polypeptide or nucleic acid. In one embodiment, candidate p53 modulating agents are tested with an assay system comprising a CAD polypeptide or nucleic acid. Candidate agents that produce a change in the activity of the assay system relative to controls are identified as candidate p53 modulating agents. The assay system may be cell-based or cell-free. CAD-modulating agents include CAD related proteins (e.g. dominant negative mutants, and biotherapeutics); CAD-specific antibodies; CAD-specific antisense oligomers and other nucleic acid modulators; and chemical agents that specifically bind CAD or compete with CAD binding target. In one specific embodiment, a small molecule modulator is identified using an adhesion assay.

The dachsous gene was identified as a modifier of the p53 pathway. Accordingly, vertebrate orthologs of these modifiers, and preferably the human orthologs, cadherin related (CAD) genes (i.e., nucleic acids and polypeptides) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of pathologies associated with a defective p53 signaling pathway, such as cancer.</p><p num="p0018">In vitro and in vivo methods of assessing CAD function are provided herein. Modulation of the CAD or their respective binding partners is useful for understanding the association of the p53 pathway and its members in normal and disease conditions and for developing diagnostics and therapeutic modalities for p53 related pathologies. CAD- modulating agents that act by inhibiting or enhancing CAD expression, directly or indirectly, for example, by affecting a CAD function such as binding activity, can be identified using methods provided herein. CAD modulating agents are useful in diagnosis, therapy and pharmaceutical development.</p><p num="p0019">Nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention</p><p num="p0020">Sequences related to CAD nucleic acids and polypeptides that can be used in the invention are disclosed in Genbank (referenced by Genbank identifier (GI) number) as GI#s 12060936 (SEQ ID NO:l), 16507961 (SEQ ID NO:2), 16507963 (SEQ ID NO:3), 18576725 (SEQ ID NO:4), 1107686 (SEQ ID NO:5), 7407143 (SEQ ID NO:6), 13787216 (SEQ ID NO:7), and 16933556 (SEQ ID NO: 10) for nucleic acid, and GI#s 12060937 (SEQ ID NO: 11), 17366834 (SEQ ID NO: 12), 8928104 (SEQ ID NO: 13), 4885229 (SEQ ID NO: 14), 7407144 (SEQ ID NO: 15), and 16933557 (SEQ ID NO: 16) for polypeptides.

The term "CAD polypeptide" refers to a full-length CAD protein or a functionally active fragment or derivative thereof. A "functionally active" CAD fragment or derivative exhibits one or more functional activities associated with a full-length, wild-type CAD protein, such as antigenic or 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
immunogenic activity, adhesion activity, ability to bind natural cellular substrates, etc. The functional activity of CAD proteins, derivatives and fragments can be assayed by various methods known to one skilled in the art (Current Protocols in Protein Science (1998) Coligan et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Somerset, New Jersey) and as further discussed below. For purposes herein, functionally active fragments also include those fragments that comprise one or more structural domains of a CAD, such as a cadherin domain or a binding domain. Protein domains can be identified using the PFAM program (Bateman A., et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1999, 27:260-2; http://pfam.wustl.edu). For example, the cadherin domains of CAD from GI# 17366834 (SEQ ID NO: 12) are located at approximately amino acid residues 38 to 121, 137 to 227, 241 to 337, 353 to 451, 465 to</p><p num="p0022">552, 566 to 662, 676 to 769, 783 to 879, 895 to 986, 1000 to 1091, 1107 to 1199, 1214 to 1304, 1318 to 1409, 1424 to 1518, 1533 to 1625, 1639 to 1735, 1750 to 1842, 1856 to 1947, 1964 to 2060, 2074 to 2165, 2179 to 2284, 2301 to 2393, 2407 to 2500, 2514 to 2602, 2618 to 2711, 2733 to 2828, and 2851 to 2951 (PFAM 00028). Likewise, the cadherin domains of GI# 4885229 (SEQ ID NO: 14) are located at approximately amino acid residues 39 to 140, 154 to 248, 372 to 454, 468 to 560, 574 to 664, 722 to 813, 827 to 918, 932 to 1023, 1039 to 1130, 1144 to 1236, 1250 to 1346, 1363 to 1447, 1461 to 1553, 1567 to 1661, 1675 to 1759, 1773 to 1871, 1887 to 1973, 1987 to 2073, 2089 to 2178, 2190 to 2277, 2291 to 2384, 2398 to 2486, 2500 to 2590, 2604 to 2696, 2710 to 2802, 2816 to 2911, 2925 to 3016, 3030 to 3118, 3132 to 3223, 3237 to 3328, 3342 to 3433, 3447 to 3538, and 3553 to 3634; the cadherin domains of GI# 7407144 (SEQ ID NO: 15) are located at approximately amino acid residues 38 to 139, 153 to 247, 367 to 449, 463 to</p><p num="p0023">553, 569 to 659, 720 to 811, 825 to 916, 930 to 1019, 1037 to 1128, 1142 to 1233, 1247 to 1337, 1354 to 1438, 1453 to 1546, 1560 to 1651, 1665 to 1749, 1763 to 1861, 1877 to 1959, 1973 to 2061, 2075 to 2164, 2176 to 2263, 2277 to 2370, 2384 to 2472, 2486 to 2576, 2590 to 2682, 2696 to 2786, 2802 to 2897, 2911 to 3002, 3016 to 3104, 3119 to 3209, 3223 to 3312, 3326 to 3417, 3431 to 3522, and 3536 to 3620; and the cadherin domains of GI# 16933557 (SEQ ID NO: 16) are located at approximately amino acid residues 47 to 134, 148 to 246, 260 to 353, 371 to 463, 478 to 569, 583 to 676, 690 to 781, 795 to 885, 899 to 989, 1005 to 1096, 1110 to 1202, 1222 to 1312, 1337 to 1427, 1441 to 1537, 1550 to 1640, 1654 to 1742, 1756 to 1846, 1860 to 1951, 1974 to 2059, 2073 to 2162, 2176 to 2268, 2281 to 2367, 2381 to 2473, 2487 to 2593, 2607 to 2697, 2711 to 2804, and 2818 to 2923. Methods for obtaining CAD polypeptides are also further described below. In some embodiments, preferred fragments are functionally active, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
domain-containing fragments comprismg at least 25 contiguous amino acids, preferably at least 50, more preferably 75, and most preferably at least 100 contiguous amino acids of any one of SEQ ID NOs:ll, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16(a CAD). In further preferred embodiments, the fragment comprises the entire adhesion (functionally active) domain. The term "CAD nucleic acid" refers to a DNA or RNA molecule that encodes a CAD polypeptide. Preferably, the CAD polypeptide or nucleic acid or fragment thereof is from a human, but can also be an ortholog, or derivative thereof with at least 70% sequence identity, preferably at least 80%, more preferably 85%, still more preferably 90%, and most preferably at least 95% sequence identity with CAD. Normally, orthologs in different species retain the same function, due to presence of one or more protein motifs and/or 3-dimensional structures. Orthologs are generally identified by sequence homology analysis, such as BLAST analysis, usually using protein bait sequences. Sequences are assigned as a potential ortholog if the best hit sequence from the forward BLAST result retrieves the original query sequence in the reverse BLAST (Huynen MA and Bork P, Proc Natl Acad Sci (1998) 95:5849-5856; Huynen MA et al, Genome Research (2000) 10:1204-1210). Programs for multiple sequence alignment, such as CLUSTAL (Thompson JD et al, 1994, Nucleic Acids Res 22:4673-4680) may be used to highlight conserved regions and/or residues of orthologous proteins and to generate phylogenetic trees. In a phylogenetic tree representing multiple homologous sequences from diverse species (e.g., retrieved through BLAST analysis), orthologous sequences from two species generally appear closest on the tree with respect to all other sequences from these two species. Structural threading or other analysis of protein folding (e.g., using software by ProCeryon, Biosciences, Salzburg, Austria) may also identify potential orthologs. In evolution, when a gene duplication event follows speciation, a single gene in one species, such as Drosophila, may correspond to multiple genes (paralogs) in another, such as human. As used herein, the term "orthologs" encompasses paralogs. As used herein, "percent (%) sequence identity" with respect to a subject sequence, or a specified portion of a subject sequence, is defined as the percentage of nucleotides or amino acids in the candidate derivative sequence identical with the nucleotides or amino acids in the subject sequence (or specified portion thereof), after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, as generated by the program WU-BLAST-2.0al9 (Altschul et al, J. Mol. Biol. (1997) 215:403-410; http://blast.wustl.edu/blast/README.html) with all the search parameters set to default values. The HSP S and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched. A % identity value is determined by the number of matching identical nucleotides or amino acids divided by the sequence length for which the percent identity is being reported. "Percent (%) amino acid sequence similarity" is determined by doing the same calculation as for determining % amino acid sequence identity, but including conservative amino acid substitutions in addition to identical amino acids in the computation.</p><p num="p0024">A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid having similar properties such that the folding or activity of the protein is not significantly affected. Aromatic amino acids that can be substituted for each other are phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine; interchangeable hydrophobic amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine; interchangeable polar amino acids are glutamine and asparagine; interchangeable basic amino acids are arginine, lysine and histidine; interchangeable acidic amino acids are aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and interchangeable small amino acids are alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine and glycine. Alternatively, an alignment for nucleic acid sequences is provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2:482-489; database: European Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/MPsrch/; Smith and Waterman, 1981, J. of Molec.Biol., 147:195- 197; Nicholas et al., 1998, "A Tutorial on Searching Sequence Databases and Sequence Scoring Methods" (www.psc.edu) and references cited therein.; W.R. Pearson, 1991, Genomics 11:635-650). This algorithm can be applied to amino acid sequences by using the scoring matrix developed by Dayhoff (Dayhoff: Atlas of Protein Sequences and Structure, M. O. Dayhoff ed., 5 suppl. 3:353-358, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D.C., USA), and normalized by Gribskov (Gribskov 1986 Nucl. Acids Res. 14(6):6745-6763). The Smith- Waterman algorithm may be employed where default parameters are used for scoring (for example, gap open penalty of 12, gap extension penalty of two). From the data generated, the "Match" value reflects "sequence identity." Derivative nucleic acid molecules of the subject nucleic acid molecules include sequences that hybridize to the nucleic acid sequence of any of SEQ JD NOs:l, 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6 ,7 ,8, 9, or 10. The stringency of hybridization can be controlled by temperature, ionic strength, pH, and the presence of denaturing agents such as formamide during hybridization and washing. Conditions routinely used are set out in readily available

In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention is capable of hybridizing to a nucleic acid molecule containing the nucleotide sequence of any one of SEQ JD NOs:l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 under stringent hybridization conditions that comprise: prehybridization of filters containing nucleic acid for 8 hours to overnight at 65° C in a solution comprising 6X single strength citrate (SSC) (IX SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na citrate; pH 7.0), 5X Denhardt's solution, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA; hybridization for 18-20 hours at 65° C in a solution containing 6X SSC, IX Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate; and washing of filters at 65° C for lh in a solution containing 0.2X SSC and 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate).</p><p num="p0025">In other embodiments, moderately stringent hybridization conditions are used that comprise: pretreatment of filters containing nucleic acid for 6 h at 40° C in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 5mM EDTA, 0.1 % PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA; hybridization for 18-20h at 40° C in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 5mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate; followed by washing twice for 1 hour at 55° C in a solution containing 2X SSC and 0.1% SDS.</p><p num="p0026">Alternatively, low stringency conditions can be used that comprise: incubation for 8 hours to overnight at 37° C in a solution comprising 20% formamide, 5 x SSC, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5X Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 μg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA; hybridization in the same buffer for 18 to 20 hours; and washing of filters in 1 x SSC at about 37° C for 1 hour.</p><p num="p0027">Isolation, Production, Expression, and Mis-expression of CAD Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides</p><p num="p0028">CAD nucleic acids and polypeptides, useful for identifying and testing agents that modulate CAD function and for other applications related to the involvement of CAD in the p53 pathway. CAD nucleic acids and derivatives and orthologs thereof may be obtained using any available method. For instance, techniques for isolating cDNA or genomic DNA sequences of interest by screening DNA libraries or by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are well known in the art. In general, the particular use for the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
protein will dictate the particulars of expression, production, and purification methods. For instance, production of proteins for use in screening for modulating agents may require methods that preserve specific biological activities of these proteins, whereas production of proteins for antibody generation may require structural integrity of particular epitopes. Expression of proteins to be purified for screening or antibody production may require the addition of specific tags (e.g., generation of fusion proteins). Overexpression of a CAD protein for assays used to assess CAD function, such as involvement in cell cycle regulation or hypoxic response, may require expression in eukaryotic cell lines capable of these cellular activities. Techniques for the expression, production, and purification of proteins are well known in the art; any suitable means therefore may be used (e.g., Higgins SJ and Hames BD (eds.) Protem Expression: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press Inc., New York 1999; Stanbury PF et al., Principles of Fermentation Technology, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, Elsevier Science, New York, 1995; Doonan S (ed.) Protein Purification Protocols, Humana Press, New Jersey, 1996; Coligan JE et al, Current Protocols in Protem Science (eds.), 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). In particular embodiments, recombinant CAD is expressed in a cell line known to have defective p53 function (e.g. SAOS-2 osteoblasts, H1299 lung cancer cells, C33A and HT3 cervical cancer cells, HT-29 and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, among others, available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). The recombinant cells are used in cell-based screening assay systems of the invention, as described further below. The nucleotide sequence encoding a CAD polypeptide can be inserted into any appropriate expression vector. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals, including promoter/enhancer element, can derive from the native CAD gene and/or its flanking regions or can be heterologous. A variety of host-vector expression systems may be utilized, such as mammalian cell systems infected with virus (e.g. vaccinia virus, adenovirus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with virus (e.g. baculovirus); microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors, or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA. A host cell strain that modulates the expression of, modifies, and/or specifically processes the gene product may be used. To detect expression of the CAD gene product, the expression vector can comprise a promoter operably linked to a CAD gene nucleic acid, one or more origins of replication, and, one or more selectable markers (e.g. thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, etc.). Alternatively, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
assaying for the expression of the CAD gene product based on the physical or functional properties of the CAD protein in in vitro assay systems (e.g. immunoassays).</p><p num="p0029">The CAD protein, fragment, or derivative may be optionally expressed as a fusion, or chimeric protein product (i.e. it is joined via a peptide bond to a heterologous protein sequence of a different protein), for example to facilitate purification or detection. A chimeric product can be made by ligating the appropriate nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired amino acid sequences to each other using standard methods and expressing the chimeric product. A chimeric product may also be made by protein synthetic techniques, e.g. by use of a peptide synthesizer (Hunkapiller et al, Nature (1984) 310:105-111). Once a recombinant cell that expresses the CAD gene sequence is identified, the gene product can be isolated and purified using standard methods (e.g. ion exchange, affinity, and gel exclusion chromatography; centrifugation; differential solubility; electrophoresis, cite purification reference). Alternatively, native CAD proteins can be purified from natural sources, by standard methods (e.g. immunoaffinity purification). Once a protein is obtained, it may be quantified and its activity measured by appropriate methods, such as immunoassay, bioassay, or other measurements of physical properties, such as crystallography.</p><p num="p0030">The methods of this invention may also use cells that have been engineered for altered expression (mis-expression) of CAD or other genes associated with the p53 pathway. As used herein, mis-expression encompasses ectopic expression, over-expression, under- expression, and non-expression (e.g. by gene knock-out or blocking expression that would otherwise normally occur).</p><p num="p0031">Genetically modified animals Animal models that have been genetically modified to alter CAD expression may be used in in vivo assays to test for activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent, or to further assess the role of CAD in a p53 pathway process such as apoptosis or cell proliferation. Preferably, the altered CAD expression results in a detectable phenotype, such as decreased or increased levels of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, or apoptosis compared to control animals having normal CAD expression. The genetically modified animal may additionally have altered p53 expression (e.g. p53 knockout). Preferred genetically modified animals are mammals such as primates, rodents (preferably mice), cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs and cats. Preferred non-mammalian species include zebrafish, C. elegans, and Drosophila. Preferred genetically modified animals are transgenic animals

having a heterologous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element in a portion of its cells, i.e. mosaic animals (see, for example, techniques described by Jakobovits, 1994, Curr. Biol. 4:761-763.) or stably integrated into its germ line DNA (i.e., in the genomic sequence of most or all of its cells). Heterologous nucleic acid is introduced into the germ line of such transgenic animals by genetic manipulation of, for example, embryos or embryonic stem cells of the host animal.</p><p num="p0032">Methods of making transgenic animals are well-known in the art (for transgenic mice see Brinster et al., Proc.

J. Robertson, ed., IRL Press (1987)). Clones of the nonhuman transgenic animals can be produced according to available methods (see Wilmut, I. et al. (1997) Nature 385:810-813; and PCT International Publication Nos. WO 97/07668 and WO 97/07669). In one embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-out" animal having a heterozygous or homozygous alteration in the sequence of an endogenous CAD gene that results in a decrease of CAD function, preferably such that CAD expression is undetectable or insignificant. Knock-out animals are typically generated by homologous recombination with a vector comprising a transgene having at least a portion of the gene to be knocked out. Typically a deletion, addition or substitution has been introduced into the transgene to functionally disrupt it. The transgene can be a human gene (e.g., from a human genomic clone) but more preferably is an ortholog of the human gene derived from the transgenic host species. For example, a mouse CAD gene is used to construct a homologous recombination vector suitable for altering an endogenous CAD gene in the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
mouse genome. Detailed methodologies for homologous recombination in mice are available (see Capecchi, Science (1989) 244:1288-1292; Joyner et al, Nature (1989) 338:153-156). Procedures for the production of non-rodent transgenic mammals and other animals are also available (Houdebine and Chourrout, supra; Pursel et al, Science (1989) 244:1281-1288; Simms et al, Bio/Technology (1988) 6:179-183). In a preferred embodiment, knock-out animals, such as mice harboring a knockout of a specific gene, may be used to produce antibodies against the human counterpart of the gene that has been knocked out (Claesson MH et al., (1994) Scan J Immunol 40:257-264; Declerck PJ et al., (1995) J Biol Chem. 270:8397-400). In another embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-in" animal having an alteration in its genome that results in altered expression (e.g., increased (including ectopic) or decreased expression) of the CAD gene, e.g., by introduction of additional copies of CAD, or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for altered expression of an endogenous copy of the CAD gene. Such regulatory sequences include inducible, tissue-specific, and constitutive promoters and enhancer elements. The knock- in can be homozygous or heterozygous.</p><p num="p0033">Transgenic nonhuman animals can also be produced that contain selected systems allowing for regulated expression of the transgene. One example of such a system that may be produced is the cre/loxP recombinase system of bacteriophage PI (Lakso et ah, PNAS (1992) 89:6232-6236; U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,317). If a cre/loxP recombinase system is used to regulate expression of the transgene, animals containing transgenes encoding both the Cre recombinase and a selected protein are required. Such animals can be provided through the construction of "double" transgenic animals, e.g., by mating two transgenic animals, one containing a transgene encoding a selected protein and the other containing a transgene encoding a recombinase. Another example of a recombinase system is the FLP recombinase system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (O'Gorman et al. (1991) Science 251:1351-1355; U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,182). In a preferred embodiment, both Cre-LoxP and Flp-Frt are used in the same system to regulate expression of the transgene, and for sequential deletion of vector sequences in the same cell (Sun X et al (2000) Nat Genet 25 : 83-6).</p><p num="p0034">The genetically modified animals can be used in genetic studies to further elucidate the p53 pathway, as animal models of disease and disorders implicating defective p53 function, and for in vivo testing of candidate therapeutic agents, such as those identified in screens described below. The candidate therapeutic agents are administered to a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
genetically modified animal having altered CAD function and phenotypic changes are compared with appropriate control animals such as genetically modified animals that receive placebo treatment, and/or animals with unaltered CAD expression that receive candidate therapeutic agent. In addition to the above-described genetically modified animals having altered CAD function, animal models having defective p53 function (and otherwise normal CAD function), can be used in the methods of the present invention. For example, a p53 knockout mouse can be used to assess, in vivo, the activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent identified in one of the in vitro assays described below. p53 knockout mice are described in the literature (Jacks et al, Nature 2001;410:1111-1116, 1043-1044; Donehower et al, supra).

 Preferred CAD-modulating agents include small molecule compounds; CAD- interacting proteins, including antibodies and other biotherapeutics; and nucleic acid modulators such as antisense and RNA inhibitors. The modulating agents may be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions, for example, as compositions that may comprise other active ingredients, as in combination therapy, and/or suitable carriers or excipients. Techniques for formulation and administration of the compounds may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 19<sup>th</sup> edition.</p><p num="p0038">Small molecule modulators</p><p num="p0039">Small molecules, are often preferred to modulate function of proteins with enzymatic function, and/or containing protein interaction domains. Chemical agents, referred to in the art as "small molecule" compounds are typically organic, non-peptide molecules, having a molecular weight less than 10,000, preferably less than 5,000, more preferably less than 1,000, and most preferably less than 500. This class of modulators includes chemically synthesized molecules, for instance, compounds from combinatorial chemical libraries. Synthetic compounds may be rationally designed or identified based on known or inferred properties of the CAD protein or may be identified by screening compound libraries. Alternative appropriate modulators of this class are natural products, particularly secondary metabolites from organisms such as plants or fungi, which can also be identified by screening compound libraries for CAD-modulating activity. Methods for generating and obtaining compounds are well known in the art (Schreiber SL, Science (2000) 151: 1964-1969; Radmann J and Gunther J, Science (2000) 151:1947-1948). Small molecule modulators identified from screening assays, as described below, can be used as lead compounds from which candidate clinical compounds may be designed, optimized, and synthesized. Such clinical compounds may have utility in treating pathologies associated with the p53 pathway. The activity of candidate small molecule modulating agents may be improved several-fold through iterative secondary functional validation, as further described below, structure determination, and candidate modulator modification and testing. Additionally, candidate clinical compounds are generated with specific regard to clinical and pharmacological properties. For example, the reagents may be derivatized and re-screened using in vitro and in vivo assays to optimize activity and minimize toxicity for pharmaceutical development.

 Protein Modulators</p><p num="p0040">Specific CAD-interacting proteins are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications related to the p53 pathway and related disorders, as well as in validation assays for other CAD-modulating agents. In a preferred embodiment, CAD-interacting proteins affect normal CAD function, including transcription, protein expression, protein localization, and cellular or extra-cellular activity. In another embodiment, CAD- interacting proteins are useful in detecting and providing information about the function of CAD proteins, as is relevant to p53 related disorders, such as cancer (e.g., for diagnostic means). A CAD-interacting protein may be endogenous, i.e. one that naturally interacts genetically or biochemically with a CAD, such as a member of the CAD pathway that modulates CAD expression, localization, and/or activity. CAD-modulators include dominant negative forms of CAD-interacting proteins and of CAD proteins themselves. Yeast two-hybrid and variant screens offer preferred methods for identifying endogenous CAD-interacting proteins (Finley, R. L. et al.

Epitopes of CAD which are particularly antigenic can be selected, for example, by routine screening of CAD polypeptides for antigenicity or by applying a theoretical method for selecting antigenic regions of a protein (Hopp and Wood (1981), Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-28; Hopp and Wood, (1983) Mol.

If CAD fragments are used, they preferably comprise at least 10, and more preferably, at least 20 contiguous amino acids of a CAD protein. In a particular embodiment, CAD-specific antigens and/or immunogens are coupled to carrier proteins that stimulate the immune response. For example, the subject polypeptides are covalently coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier, and the conjugate is emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, which enhances the immune response.

direct role in cell proliferation. For example, an angiogenesis assay may be performed on cells that over- or under-express CAD relative to wild type cells. Differences in angiogenesis compared to wild type cells suggests that the CAD plays a direct role in angiogenesis.</p><p num="p0082">Hypoxic induction. The alpha subunit of the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HTF-l), is upregulated in tumor cells following exposure to hypoxia in vitro. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 stimulates the expression of genes known to be important in tumour cell survival, such as those encoding glyolytic enzymes and VEGF. Induction of such genes by hypoxic conditions may be assayed by growing cells transfected with CAD in hypoxic conditions (such as with 0.1% 02, 5% C02, and balance N2, generated in a Napco 7001 incubator (Precision Scientific)) and normoxic conditions, followed by assessment of gene activity or expression by Taqman®. For example, a hypoxic induction assay system may comprise a cell that expresses a CAD, and that optionally has a mutated p53 (e.g. p53 is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the hypoxic induction assay system and changes in hypoxic response relative to controls where no test agent is added, identify candidate p53 modulating agents. In some embodiments of the invention, the hypoxic induction assay may be used as a secondary assay to test a candidate p53 modulating agents that is initially identified using another assay system. A hypoxic induction assay may also be used to test whether CAD function plays a direct role in the hypoxic response. For example, a hypoxic induction assay may be performed on cells that over- or under- express CAD relative to wild type cells. Differences in hypoxic response compared to wild type cells suggests that the CAD plays a direct role in hypoxic induction.</p><p num="p0083">Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion assays measure adhesion of cells to purified adhesion proteins, or adhesion of cells to each other, in presence or absence of candidate modulating agents. Cell-protein adhesion assays measure the ability of agents to modulate the adhesion of cells to purified proteins. For example, recombinant proteins are produced, diluted to 2.5g/mL in PBS, and used to coat the wells of a microtiter plate. The wells used for negative control are not coated. Coated wells are then washed, blocked with 1% BSA, and washed again. Compounds are diluted to 2x final test concentration and added to the blocked, coated wells. Cells are then added to the wells, and the unbound cells are washed off. Retained cells are labeled directly on the plate by adding a

membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, such as calcein-AM, and the signal is quantified in a fluorescent microplate reader.</p><p num="p0084">Cell-cell adhesion assays measure the ability of agents to modulate binding of cell adhesion proteins with their native ligands. These assays use cells that naturally or recombinantly express the adhesion protein of choice. In an exemplary assay, cells expressing the cell adhesion protein are plated in wells of a multiwell plate. Cells expressing the ligand are labeled with a membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, such as BCECF , and allowed to adhere to the monolayers in the presence of candidate agents. Unbound cells are washed off, and bound cells are detected using a fluorescence plate reader.</p><p num="p0085">High-throughput cell adhesion assays have also been described. In one such assay, small molecule ligands and peptides are bound to the surface of microscope slides using a microarray spotter, intact cells are then contacted with the slides, and unbound cells are washed off. In this assay, not only the binding specificity of the peptides and modulators against cell lines are determined, but also the functional cell signaling of attached cells using immunofluorescence techniques in situ on the microchip is measured (Falsey JR et al., Bioconjug Chem. 2001 May-Jun;12(3):346-53).</p><p num="p0086">Primary assays for antibody modulators For antibody modulators, appropriate primary assays test is a binding assay that tests the antibody's affinity to and specificity for the CAD protein. Methods for testing antibody affinity and specificity are well known in the art (Harlow and Lane, 1988, 1999, supra). The enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) is a preferred method for detecting CAD-specific antibodies; others include FACS assays, radioimmunoassays, and fluorescent assays.</p><p num="p0087">Primary assays for nucleic acid modulators</p><p num="p0088">For nucleic acid modulators, primary assays may test the ability of the nucleic acid modulator to inhibit or enhance CAD gene expression, preferably mRNA expression. In general, expression analysis comprises comparing CAD expression in like populations of cells (e.g., two pools of cells that endogenously or recombinantly express CAD) in the presence and absence of the nucleic acid modulator. Methods for analyzing mRNA and protein expression are well known in the art. For instance, Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR (e.g., using the TaqMan®, PE Applied

Protein expression may also be monitored. Proteins are most commonly detected with specific antibodies or antisera directed against either the CAD protein or specific peptides. A variety of means including Western blotting, ELISA, or in situ detection, are available (Harlow E and Lane D, 1988 and 1999, supra).</p><p num="p0089">Secondary Assays</p><p num="p0090">Secondary assays may be used to further assess the activity of CAD-modulating agent identified by any of the above methods to confirm that the modulating agent affects CAD in a manner relevant to the p53 pathway.

Secondary assays can also be used to test the activity of a modulating agent on a particular genetic or biochemical pathway or to test the specificity of the modulating agent's interaction with CAD.</p><p num="p0091">Secondary assays generally compare like populations of cells or animals (e.g., two pools of cells or animals that endogenously or recombinantly express CAD) in the presence and absence of the candidate modulator. In general, such assays test whether treatment of cells or animals with a candidate CAD-modulating agent results in changes in the p53 pathway in comparison to untreated (or mock- or placebo-treated) cells or animals.

Candidate modulators are typically added to the cell media but may also be injected into cells or delivered by any other efficacious means.</p><p num="p0095">Animal Assays A variety of non-human animal models of normal or defective p53 pathway may be used to test candidate CAD modulators. Models for defective p53 pathway typically use genetically modified animals that have been engineered to mis-express (e.g., over-express or lack expression in) genes involved in the p53 pathway. Assays generally require systemic delivery of the candidate modulators, such as by oral administration, injection, etc.</p><p num="p0096">In a preferred embodiment, p53 pathway activity is assessed by monitoring neovascularization and angiogenesis. Animal models with defective and normal p53 are used to test the candidate modulator's affect on CAD in Matrigel® assays. Matrigel® is an extract of basement membrane proteins, and is composed primarily of laminin, collagen IV, and heparin sulfate proteoglycan. It is provided as a sterile liquid at 4° C, but rapidly forms a solid gel at 37° C. Liquid Matrigel® is mixed with various angiogenic agents, such as bFGF and VEGF, or with human tumor cells which over-express the CAD. The mixture is then injected subcutaneously(SC) into female athymic nude mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY) to support an intense vascular response. Mice with Matrigel® pellets may be dosed via oral (PO), intraperitoneal (IP), or intravenous (IV) routes with the candidate modulator. Mice are euthanized 5 - 12 days post-injection, and the Matrigel® pellet is harvested for hemoglobin analysis (Sigma plasma hemoglobin kit). Hemoglobin content of the gel is found to correlate the degree of neovascularization in the gel. In another preferred embodiment, the effect of the candidate modulator on CAD is assessed via tumorigenicity assays. In one example, xenograft human tumors are implanted SC into female athymic mice, 6-7 week old, as single cell suspensions either from a pre-existing tumor or from in vitro culture. The tumors which express the CAD endogenously are injected in the flank, 1 x 10 to l x lO cells per mouse in a volume of 100 μL using a 27gauge needle. Mice are then ear tagged and tumors are measured twice weekly. Candidate modulator treatment is initiated on the day the mean tumor weight reaches 100 mg. Candidate modulator is delivered IV, SC, IP, or PO by bolus administration. Depending upon the pharmacokinetics of each unique candidate modulator, dosing can be performed multiple times per day. The tumor weight is assessed by measuring perpendicular diameters with a caliper and calculated by multiplying the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="31"/>-->
measurements of diameters in two dimensions. At the end of the experiment, the excised tumors maybe utilized for biomarker identification or further analyses. For immunohistochemistry staining, xenograft tumors are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1M phosphate, pH 7.2, for 6 hours at 4°C, immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS, and rapidly frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen.</p><p num="p0097">Diagnostic and therapeutic uses</p><p num="p0098">Specific CAD-modulating agents are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications where disease or disease prognosis is related to defects in the p53 pathway, such as angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation disorders. Accordingly, the invention also provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway in a cell, preferably a cell predetermined to have defective p53 function, comprising the step of administering an agent to the cell that specifically modulates CAD activity. Preferably, the modulating agent produces a detectable phenotypic change in the cell indicating that the p53 function is restored, i.e., for example, the cell undergoes normal proliferation or progression through the cell cycle.</p><p num="p0099">The discovery that CAD is implicated in p53 pathway provides for a variety of methods that can be employed for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of diseases and disorders involving defects in the p53 pathway and for the identification of subjects having a predisposition to such diseases and disorders.</p><p num="p0100">Various expression analysis methods can be used to diagnose whether CAD expression occurs in a particular sample, including Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR, and microarray analysis, (e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994) Ausubel FM et al, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chapter 4; Freeman WM et al, Biotechniques (1999) 26:112-125; Kallioniemi OP, Ann Med 2001, 33:142-147; Blohm and Guiseppi-Elie, Curr Opin Biotechnol 2001, 12:41-47). Tissues having a disease or disorder implicating defective p53 signaling that express a CAD, are identified as amenable to treatment with a CAD modulating agent. In a preferred application, the p53 defective tissue overexpresses a CAD relative to normal tissue. For example, a Northern blot analysis of mRNA from tumor and normal cell lines, or from tumor and matching normal tissue samples from the same patient, using full or partial CAD cDNA sequences as probes, can determine whether particular tumors express or overexpress CAD.

Thus, in a specific embodiment, the invention is drawn to a method for diagnosing a disease in a patient, the method comprising: a) obtaining a biological sample from the patient; b) contacting the sample with a probe for CAD expression; c) comparing results from step (b) with a control; and d) determining whether step (c) indicates a likelihood of disease.

Increasing quantities of Drosophila p53 (titrated using different strength transgenic inserts in 1 or 2 copies) caused deterioration of normal wing morphology from mild to strong, with phenotypes including disruption of pattern and polarity of wing hairs, shortening and thickening of wing veins, progressive crumpling of the wing and appearance of dark "death" inclusions in wing blade.
