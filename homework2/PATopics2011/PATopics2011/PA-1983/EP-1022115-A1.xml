articles having a textured surface and frosted
appearance and to resins for producing such articles.</p><heading><u style="single">Related Art Statement</u></heading><p num="0002">In lighting applications, and point of purchase,
and cosmetic/decorative markets, people are always
looking for new and innovative products that can
provide flexibility for designs and fabrications at a
competitive cost.</p><p num="0003">Presently, there is not a successful plastic
product in this market that can be used in a one-step
process and provide the properties and appearance 
needed to replace sand blasted glass material. It
would be desirable to have a resin that could be used
for sheet and profile extrusion applications and that
creates a product with a surface texture and frosted
appearance.</p><p num="0004">Such a plastic material could reduce the
production and fabrication costs and provide design
flexibility for end users. Similar thermoplastic
products are traditionally made by surface treatment,
such as, sand blasting and surface pattern
fabrication, and by adding inorganic filler, such as,
barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide,
silica, etc. Such inorganic fillers are normally
difficult to disperse evenly in polymer matrix
material, reduce greatly the light transmission of the
polymer, and do not generate the desired surface
texture. Also, the filler particles have a tendency to
deteriorate physical properties of the polymer.</p><p num="0005">Fine particles (i.e. less than 15 micrometers) of
a copolymer made by an emulsion polymerization process
are sometimes added into a plastic matrix to generate
a light diffusion effect for display and light panel
applications, for example, US patent 5,346,954.
However, this type of product tends to soften the
polymer matrix and can not produce the textured
surface so often preferred by the end user.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0006">The present invention provides a novel extruded
or profile extruded polymeric article having a frosted
and/or surface textured finish, preferably both. Since
the article is a thermoplastic material, it can be
recycled, re-extruded, or injection molded to generate
the desired appearance.</p><p num="0007">In one embodiment the article is comprised of a
polymeric matrix and polymeric particles in which the 
particles are substantially spherical, are highly
crosslinked, have a mean particle size of between 15
and 70 micrometers and have a particle size
distribution between 10-110 micrometers.</p><p num="0008">In another embodiment the article is comprised of
a dispersion of cross-linked fine particles in a
substrate of a polymer matrix; the fine particles are
comprised of 0-100 % styrene, 0-100% alkyl
methacrylate, 0-100% alkyl acrylate and crosslinking
agent.</p><p num="0009">In another embodiment the article is comprised of
a dispersion of cross-linked fine particles in a
substrate of a polymer matrix; the fine particles are
comprised of 0-50% styrene, 45-100 % alkyl
methacrylate or alkyl acrylate, and 0.01-5%
crosslinking agent.</p><p num="0010">In another embodiment the article is comprised of
a dispersion of crosslinked fine particles in a
substrate polymer comprising mainly methyl
methacrylate; the fine particles are comprised of 0-50%
styrene, 45-100 % alkyl methacrylate or alkyl
acrylate, and 0.01-5% crosslinking agent.</p><p num="0011">The purpose of the highly crosslinked spherical
particles in the present invention is to impart to the
thermoplastic composition a textured surface and a
frosted appearance. The frosted appearance of the
thermoplastic compositions is achieved through the
mismatch of the refractive indexes, Δn &gt; 0.02, of the
fine particles and thermoplastic matrices. The surface
texture is controlled by the degree of crosslinking
and mean size of the fine particles.</p><p num="0012">Another aspect of the invention is the resin
composition used to produce the article. In one
embodiment, the resin comprised of
<sl><li>a) 20 - 90% polymethyl methacrylate or alkyl
methylacrylate/alkyl acrylate copolymer based matrix; </li><li>b) 0 - 50% modifiers; and</li><li>c) 5 - 60% highly crosslinked spherical beads
comprised of about
<sl><li>0-100 % styrene,</li><li>0-100% alkyl methacrylate,</li><li>0-100% alkyl acrylate and</li><li>crosslinking agent</li></sl></li></sl></p><p num="0013">In another embodiment of the invention, the resin
composition is comprised of
<sl><li>a) 20 - 90% polymethyl methacrylate based matrix,</li><li>b) 0 - 50%, preferably 5 - 50%, modifiers, and</li><li>c) 5 - 30% highly crosslinked spherical beads
comprised of styrene and/or methyl methacrylate and a
crosslinking agent.</li></sl></p><p num="0014">In another embodiment of the invention, the resin
is comprised of
<sl><li>a) 20 - 90% polymethyl methacrylate based matrix,</li><li>b) 0 - 50%, preferably 5 - 50%, modifiers, and</li><li>c) 5 - 30% highly crosslinked spherical beads
comprised of

acrylate, or combination of both</li><li>0.1 - 2.5 % crosslinking agent,</li></sl>
wherein the beads have a mean particle size of 15-70
micrometers, and a particle size distribution of
between 10-110 micrometers.</li></sl></p><p num="0015">In another embodiment of the invention, the resin
is comprised of
<sl><li>a) 70 - 85% polymethyl methacrylate based matrix; and</li><li>b) 15 - 30% highly crosslinked spherical beads
comprised of
<sl><li>15 - 35 % styrene</li><li>65 - 85 % methyl methacrylate</li><li>0.5-1.5% allylmethacrylate;</li></sl> 
wherein the beads have a mean particle size of 15-70
micrometers, and a particle size distribution of
between 15-110 micrometers.</li></sl></p><heading><u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0016">Polymers, such as, acrylic polymers, PET, PS,
ASA, SAN, MMA/S, PVC, ABS terpolymer, polycarbonate,
polyester(such as poly(butylene terephthalate) and
poly(ethylene terephthalate), MBS copolymer, HIPS,
acrylonitrile/acrylate copolymer, acrylonitrile/methyl
methacrylate copolymer, impact modified polyolefins
and impact modified PVC, etc, or mixtures thereof, can
be used as the polymeric matrix. Preferably the
polymer is an acrylic, more preferably, an impact
modified acrylic polymer.</p><p num="0017">The term "acrylic polymer(s)" as used herein
means
<sl><li>1) alkyl methacrylate homo polymers,</li><li>2) copolymers of alkyl methacrylates with other alkyl
methacrylates or alkyl acrylates or other
ethylenically unsaturated monomers,</li><li>3) alkyl acrylate homo polymers, and</li><li>4) copolymers of alkyl acrylates with other alkyl
acrylates or alkyl methacrylates or other
ethylenically unsaturated monomers.</li></sl></p><p num="0018">The alkyl group can be from 1-18 carbon atoms,
preferably 1-4 carbon atoms. Preferred are polymethyl
methacrylate based matrix and copolymers of methyl
methacrylate with from about 0.1 - 20% alkyl
acrylates, wherein the alkyl contains 1 - 4 carbon
atoms, alkyl acrylic acids wherein alkyl contains 1 -
18 carbon atoms.</p><p num="0019">Preferably the thermoplastic matrix material
comprises a polymer or copolymer of methyl
methacrylate(MMA); typical copolymers include 80 to
99% MMA and 1 to 20%, preferably 1 to 5%, of (C1-C10) 
alkyl acrylates, such as methyl acrylate and ethyl
acrylate(EA). A suitable commercially available
poly(methyl methacrylate) type thermoplastic matrix
material is Plexiglas® V-grade molding powder, such as
Plexiglas® V(825),V(825)HID, V(045),V(052) and V(920)
etc.</p><p num="0020">The polymer matrix is conveniently prepared by
conventional cell casting or melt extrusion processes
and is typically provided in particulate form. In
addition, thermoplastic matrix materials may be
prepared by a conventional bulk process (for example, a
continuous flow stirred tank reactor(CFSTR) process),
solution, suspension or emulsion polymerization
techniques, in which case conventional isolation
processes used to recover the polymer in particulate
form include, for example, filtration, coagulation and
spray drying.</p><p num="0021">The matrix may also include other modifiers or
additives which are well known in the art. For
example, the composition may contain impact modifiers,
external lubricants, antioxidants, flame retardants or
the like. If desired, ultraviolet stabilizers, flow
aids, metal additives for electronic magnetic
radiation shielding such as nickel coated graphite
fibers, antistatic agents, coupling agents, such as
amino silanes, and the like, may also be added.</p><p num="0022">One of the processes of incorporating the
modifier is to make the modified matrix by an emulsion
process.</p><p num="0023">A rubber modifier can be added to the matrix,
especially an acrylic polymer matrix, to enhance its
performance properties.</p><p num="0024">In an emulsion process, particles generated are
usually small, 0.05 - 5 micrometers. Initiators used
for the emulsion process are water soluble. The final
product from an emulsion process is a stable latex 
which is normally not suitable for filtration. The
latex emulsion is typically spray dried or
coagulated/wash dried.</p><p num="0025">The emulsifying reagents are well known to those
skilled in the art. Useful emulsifying agents include
common soaps, alkyl benzenesulfonates, such as: sodium
dodecyl benzenesulfonate, alkylphenoxypolyethylene
sulfonates, sodium lauryl sulfate, salts of long chain
amines, salts of long-chain carboxylic and sulfonic
acids, etc. In general, the emulsifier should be
compounds containing hydrocarbon groups of 8-22 carbon
atoms coupled to highly polar solubilizing groups such
as alkali metal and ammonium carboxylate groups,
sulfate half ester groups, sulfonate groups, phosphate
partial ester groups, and the like.</p><p num="0026">The blend of the multi-stage polymer (rubber
modifiers) with the thermoplastic polymer can be
accomplished by any known method, such as dispersing
the multi-stage polymer in a monomer mixture used to
prepare the thermoplastic polymer or in a monomer-polymer
syrup mixture which together would provide the
desired thermoplastic polymer. Alternatively, the
multi-stage polymer can be placed in a casting mix in
the form of an emulsion, suspension or dispersion in
water or in an organic carrier; the water or organic
carrier can then be removed before or after casting
into the final thermoplastic polymer form. The multi-stage
polymer may also be blended with the
thermoplastic polymer by extrusion compounding.
Additional specific methods and details of blending
the thermoplastic polymer and impact modifiers are
disclosed in U.S. patent No. 3,793,402.</p><p num="0027">A preferred thermoplastic matrix material is
impact modified poly(methyl methacrylate) commercially
available as Plexiglas® DR101, MI-4, and MI-7 molding
powder. Plexiglas® in North and South America, and 
Oroglas® in Europe and Asia are trademarks of Elf
Atochem North America, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</p><p num="0028">The matrix material can be made by many different
processes known in the art, including, continuous cell
casting, emulsion, suspension, bulk polymerization,
and continuous stirred tank reactions (CFSTR), etc.
Each of these methods utilize free radical
polymerization chemistry. In the continuous cell
casting process of acrylic resins, the viscous
polymer/monomer mixture, often referred to as syrup
and which has about 30-50% polymer conversion, is fed
between two stainless steel belts at a controlled
temperature. Polymer conversion is completed with the
continuous moving belt. In an emulsion process, the
major components are monomers, water, emulsifiers,
water soluble initiators, and chain transfer agents.
The water to monomer ratio is controlled between 70:30
and 40:60. A core/shell particle structure can be
achieved through grafting by an emulsion process,
which is often a preferred process for making impact
modifiers.</p><p num="0029">The highly crosslinked particles may be made by a
suspension process. The composition of the particles
may be 0-50% styrene, 45-100% alkyl methacrylate or
alkyl acrylate, or a mixture of both, and 0.01-5%
crosslinking agent. A preferred typical composition
is 10-50 % styrene, 50-90%, MMA, and 0.1-2.5%
crosslinking agent.</p><p num="0030">Crosslinking monomers suitable for use as in the
spherical polymer particles (beads) are well known to
those skilled in the art, and are generally monomers
copolymerizable with monomers present, and having at
least two or more unsaturated vinyl groups which have
approximately equal or different reactivities, such as
divinyl benzene, glycol di- and tri-methacrylate and
acrylates, ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate, allyl 
methacrylates, diallyl maleate, allyl
acryloxypropionates, butylene glycol diacrylates, etc.
Preferred crosslinkers are ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene, and allyl
methacrylate. Most preferred is allyl methacrylate.</p><p num="0031">"Highly crosslinked" means that the particulate
material can not be dissolved at all in a strong
organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or
methylene chloride (MDC). The swell ratio measurement,
which measures the particle size change in an organic
solvent after a certain period of time, is normally a
test method to determine the degree of crosslinking.
A low swell ratio, no soluble fraction in a MDC/THF
solvent, and the retention of particle integrity are
the indications of a highly crosslinked acrylic
polymer. The degree of crosslinking can also be
monitored through surface hardness and surface gloss
measurements. The related test methods are American
Standard Test Methods: ASTM D785 and ASTM D2457.</p><p num="0032">The beads have a mean particle size of 15-70
micrometers, preferably, 25-55 micrometers, and a
particle size distribution of between 10-110
micrometers. The particle size may be controlled by
agitation speed, reaction time, and level and type of
suspending agents. The "mean particle size" is a
weight mean. As used herein and in the following
sections and appended claims, the term "weight mean"
or "weight percent" means average by weight or the
percent by weight of each component based on the total
weight of composition. The light scattering methods
used for particle size determination are ASTM:D4464,
B822, and ISO13321:1996(E).</p><p num="0033">The composition of the polymer particles may be
analyzed by a pyrolysis GC/MS spectrometer where the
polymer material is pyrolyzed at an elevated 
temperature and the decomposed components are analyzed
further for a quantitative determination.</p><p num="0034">In order for the article produced by the blend of
the resin and particles to be frosted, the refractive
index of the crosslinked particles has to be different
from that of the matrix material. The difference in
refractive index should be Δn&gt;0.02. The crosslinked
spherical particles have mismatched refractive indices
with many thermoplastic polymers, such as, but not
limited to, acrylic polymers (defined as above),
polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride and the like,
polystyrene, PET, PETG, imidized polymers of methyl
methacrylate, copolymer of acrylonitrile and styrene,
and copolymer of styrene and MMA.</p><p num="0035">The spherical particles may be made by a
suspension process wherein the water is a continuous
phase serving as a heat transfer medium and the
polymerization is carried out in monomer droplets. In
a suspension process the viscosity change during the
polymer conversion is very small; therefore, the heat
transfer is very efficient. The agitation speed, and
composition and level of the suspending agent are
critical factors in determining the particle size
distribution. The typical particle size from
suspension is about 10 - 1000 micrometers. More
detailed information about the suspension process can
be found in US Patent 5,705,580, EP 0,683,182-A2, and
EP 0,774,471-A1. Typical examples of using the
suspension process for the spherical particles are
provided in Examples 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C respectively.</p><p num="0036">It is within the scope of the present invention
to color the crosslinked beads during the suspension
process. The advantages of using colored beads over a
colored matrix material are process flexibility, cost
reduction, better color dispersion, reduced surface
gloss, deep/natural color appearance and a reduction 
in cleaning process equipment between product changes.</p><p num="0037">The surface textured and frosted article of the
present invention is a polymeric matrix which contains
the highly crosslinked spherical particles which have
a mean particle size between 15 and 70 micrometers,
and a particle size distribution between 0.2-110
micrometers.</p><p num="0038">A particularly preferred embodiment has the

by extrusion compounding together the crosslinked
particles(beads) made from the suspension process, the
optional modifiers, and the polymer matrix on a single
or twin screw extruder to produce an article having a
surface textured and frosted appearance.</p><p num="0040">An example of the process for producing an
article of the present invention is as follows:</p><p num="0041">The cross-linked spherical beads may be dried in
an hot air oven before compounding into a
thermoplastic matrix through, for example, a Killion
extruder equipped with a two-stage medium work screw
and a vacuum venting system. A WP twin screw extruder
can also be used for the compounding. The beads,
polymer, and additives are added into the extruder
through different feeders on the extruder. The
conveyer system for spherical beads should be a closed
system to avoid safety hazards and dust hazards. The
beads are fed into the Killion extruder through a K-TRON®
hopper with an auger screw by gravimetric 
control or by volumetric feeding control. The
temperature profile which can be used for making the
frosted article when the composition contains 10-35%
suspension beads, made by Example 2C, and 65-90% PMMA
made by a free radical polymerization process, can be
as follows:</p><p num="0042">Typical process conditions for compounding

same way as normal thermoplastics, such as, by profile
extrusion, sheet extrusion, injection molding, and
plunge molding, etc., into various final products. The
product resulting from sheet or profile extrusion will
have a textured surface and frosted appearance while
the product resulting from injection molding will have
a frosted look.</p><p num="0045">The frosted article(for example extruded sheet
product) can also be produced by feeding directly the
crosslinked particles with the matrix resins into a
sheet extruder or injection molding machine to
eliminate the compounding step. The precompounded
resin is better suited for commercial applications and
user friendly because direct feeding of beads requires
special equipment to handle the slippery beads.</p><p num="0046">The crosslinked beads from the suspension process
can also be extrusion compounded into other polymers,
such as, PC, PET, PS, ABS terpolymer, ASA copolymer,
HIPS, SAN, PVC, modified PVC, MBS copolymer, etc., to
generate a similar effect. </p><p num="0047">Unlike other surface treated product, the frosted
appearance and textured surface from this invention
can be maintained through thermoforming, bending, and
other post-treatments. The "textured surface" can be
generated through conventional extrusion or profile
extrusion equipment without the requirements of a
specific patterned roll or polishing equipment,
providing process flexibility for the end users.</p><p num="0048">By the term "textured surface" as used herein is
meant a minimum surface roughness of 0.5 um to as high
as 30 um or higher. Surface Roughness is determined
by a TENCOR Alpha-step 500 surface profiler, the
reference method number can be found in ASME: B46.1.1,
B46.1.2, B46.1.12, ASME Y14.36. ASME is an
abbreviation for the American Society of Mechanic
Engineering.</p><p num="0049">One of the advantages of the current invention is
that the Total White Light Transmission (TWLT) is much
higher than the similar commercial products filled by
inorganic fillers, such as barium sulfate or color
concentrate, to achieve a frosted appearance. For
example, barium sulfate pigmented PMMA has a 47% TWLT
while the frosted product of the present invention has
a 84% TWLT, and both have a similar frosted
appearance. The sample made from suspension beads
described in Example 2C allows more light to be
transmitted in lighting applications.</p><p num="0050">TWLT is measured by a Hunterlab colorimeter-D25
model, ASTM: E1331 and E1164. The frosted appearance
can be determined by an opacity measurement. The
higher the opacity number, the better the hiding power
of the thermoplastic sample. To have a frosted
appearance, the minimum opacity number should be about
10%. The loading of suspension beads and mismatch of
refractive index between beads and matrix material
would affect the hiding power of the sample which is 
measured by the opacity number. The related standard
methods for these measurements are ASTM D2805-80, ASTM
D589-65, TAPPI T-425, TAPPI T-519.</p><p num="0051">The composition of the current invention can be
used for profile and sheet extrusion to generate final
parts for lighting, signs, point of purchase and
cosmetic displays, containers, home and office
decorations, furniture applications, shower doors, and
office doors where privacy is preserved without
sacrificing loss of light.</p><p num="0052">The present invention will now be exemplified in

are made by the method described in Example 2B by
varying the amount of allyl methacrylate in each
sample. The particles have a weight mean particle size
of 33 micrometers. The particles with different
crosslinking levels are compounded into a rubber
modified PMMA matrix through a Killion extruder and
then passed through a sheet extruder to generate the
samples for evaluation. </p><p num="0088">The loading of the particles in each sample is 20%
beads and 80% rubber modified PMMA matrix. After
multiple passes through the extruder, the particles
with the lower level of crosslinking agent can not
sustain their integrity and are deformed, which is a
contributing factor for a non homogeneous surface
texture of the sheet samples. The better samples are
generated from the particles having at least 0.6%
crosslinking agent. The sample VI-D gives the best
results among the samples tested. The proper
crosslinking in the suspension particles appears to be
critical to the final appearance of the product.
