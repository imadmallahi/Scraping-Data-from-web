The present invention is more particularly directed to a method for soil stabilization in a deep soil mixing method using a soil dispersant, and a soil stabilization system including a cement grout and the soil dispersant.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The Deep Soil Mixing Method (DSM) is a soil stabilization technique by which soil-cement walls or columns are formed in situ. The DSM method is practiced by the use of a crawler crane having a set of leads which guides a plurality of hydraulically driven mixing paddles and augers. The hollow stemmed augers penetrate the soil, and a grout slurry is injected into the soil through the auger tip. As the auger flights break up the soil, it is lifted to the mixing paddles where it is mixed with the grout as the auger continues downward and is subsequently withdrawn. The augers are next moved adjacent to and overlapping the first excavation and the procedure is repeated, so that a selected pattern of continuous soil-concrete walls is formed. Vertical reinforcing beams are often placed into the soil-concrete structure to increase bending resistance.</p><p>The DSM method is used to form soil-cement structures for excavation support walls, such as for tunnels, retaining walls, water cutoff walls, foundations, and the like. In addition to construction, the DSM method finds usefulness in soil stabilization, environmental remediation, backfilling and landfill applications.</p><p>A problem that is encountered, however, by the DSM method, is the difficulties encountered with highly cohesive soils, such as fine sand, silty soils and clay. An example of this is Boston Blue Clay, a glacial clay deposit that is very cohesive. The auger has difficulty augering into the soil, which is primarily this cohesive clay, to permit the introduction of a cement grout.</p><p>There are known disperants for clay, particularly bentonite clay, used in oil well drilling and some construction techniques. However, these are primarily useful for aqueous slurries carrying a small percentage of clay (5-10%) as a dispersion with water as the continuous fluid. In the DSM method, the continuous phase is the soil, containing about 25% water in a form that is primarily bound within the clay layers. These bentonite aqueous dispersants are useful for low concentrations of the clay in water, used to carry rock cuttings away from the drill bit. They are not useful in enhancing the workability of soil in the DSM method.</p><p>Another drawback of conventional clay dispersants with respect to the DSM method, is that when added to the soil, they cause immediate flocculation, or setting of the cement grout when it is contacted with the dispersant-soil mixture. This prevents thorough mixing of the cement grout with the soil which is needed so that uniform strength can be developed, and further prevents reinforcements from being placed into the soil-cement structure.</p><p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a deep mix soil stabilization method which enhances workability of highly cohesive soils, such as fine sand, silty soil and clay.</p><p>It is also an object of the present invention to provide a deep mix soil stabilization method which enhances workability of highly cohesive soils, such as fine sand, silty soil and clay by the use of soil dispersants.</p><p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a deep mix soil stabilization method which avoids premature flocculation of the soil and cement grout mixture to permit thorough mixing of the soil and grout and the introduction of reinforcements into the soil-cement structure.</p><p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a deep mix soil stabilization method which uses soil dispersants which do not cause premature flocculation of the soil and cement grout mixture to permit thorough mixing of the soil and grout and the introduction of reinforcements into the soil-cement structure.</p><p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a deep mix soil stabilization method which provides lower viscosity of the soil-cement mixture, and enhances compressive strength development of the stabilized soil-cement structure.</p><p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a deep mix soil stabilization method which provides lower viscosity of the soil-cement mixture, and enhances compressive strength development of the stabilized soil-cement structure by the use of cement dispersants in combination with the soil dispersants.</p><p>These and other objects of the invention are accomplished by the method which is hereafter described and claimed.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention therefore provides a deep mix soil stabilization method comprising: drilling into soil while injecting a soil dispersant and subjecting the soil and the soil dispersant to mixing to form a soil and soil dispersant mixture, said soil dispersant comprising at least one of i) an acrylic acid polymer or copolymer, or a salt thereof, ii) an acrylic acid/sulfonic acid copolymer, or a salt thereof, iii) an acrylic acid/phosphonic acid copolymer or a salt thereof, and iv) a blend of an acrylic acid polymer with at least one of a sulfonic acid polymer and a phosphonic acid polymer, or a salt thereof; and, mixing a cementitious binder with said soil and soil dispersant mixture to form a predominantly soil-containing stabilized soil.</p><p>The cementitious binder may be mixed into the soil simultaneously with, or subsequent to forming the soil and soil dispersant mixture. The cementitious binder is selected from the group consisting of hydraulic cement, lime, fly ash and mixtures thereof, and is preferably a portland cement grout. The cementitious binder may additionally contain a pozzolan, such as fly ash, silica fume, rice husk ash, natural pozzolans, metakaolinite and blast furnace slag. The cement grout may also contain an effective cement dispersant other than the soil dispersant, preferably selected from the group consisting of lignosulfonates, beta naphthalenesulfonates and mixtures thereof.</p><p>Preferably, the soil dispersant is a salt of the polymer or copolymer, most preferably selected from lithium, sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts, and mixtures thereof, particularly in the situation where the soil dispersant is mixed with the soil prior to the introduction of the cementitious binder.</p><p>The present invention therefore also provides a deep mix soil stabilization system comprising a hydraulic cement grout, and a soil dispersant comprising at least one of i) an acrylic acid polymer or copolymer, or a salt thereof, ii) an acrylic acid/sulfonic acid copolymer, or a salt thereof, iii) an acrylic acid/phosphonic acid copolymer or a salt thereof, and iv) a blend of an acrylic acid polymer with at least one of a sulfonic acid polymer and a phosphonic acid polymer, or a salt thereof.</p><heading>PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention is a deep mix soil stabilization method, such as for preparing a stabilized soil formation to permit tunneling between portions of the stabilized columns or walls. The method includes drilling into the soil, such as by auguring into the soil, while injecting a soil dispersant, and mixing the soil and soil dispersant, to form a soil and soil dispersant mixture. The soil dispersant is at least one of i) an acrylic acid polymer or copolymer, or a salt thereof, ii) an acrylic acid/sulfonic acid copolymer, or a salt thereof, iii) an acrylic acid/phosphonic acid copolymer or a salt thereof, and iv) a blend of an acrylic acid polymer with at least one of a sulfonic acid polymer and a phosphonic acid polymer, or a salt thereof. In order to stabilize the soil, a cementitious binder is mixed with the soil and soil dispersant mixture to form a predominantly soil-containing, stabilized soil.</p><p>The cementitious binder can be mixed either simultaneously with or subsequent to forming the soil and soil dispersant mixture. That is, the cementitious binder can be injected, or pumped, into the soil at the same time that the soil dispersant is being injected or pumped into the soil, such as when the auger is drilling down into the soil. In this embodiment, the soil dispersant may be introduced into the soil as a component of the cement grout. Alternatively, the soil dispersant can be pumped into and mixed with the soil while the auger is drilling down, and the cementitious binder can be introduced into and mixed with the soil/soil dispersant mixture while the auger is being withdrawn from the soil.</p><p>The method of the present invention includes positioning reinforcements into the stabilized soil, such as steel rods or cages.</p><p>The method of the present invention, utilizing the soil dispersants permits the stabilization of even highly cohesive soil, such as fine sands, silty soils, and clay. The present soil stabilization method is most preferred when the soil to be stabilized contains a high proportion of clay. For purposes of exemplification, the present invention has been tested with Boston Blue Clay, from the Boston harbor area, the results of which are reported below.</p><p>It should be understood that the method of the present invention, utilizing the defined soil dispersants, is able to enhance the workability of a soil mass containing predominantly soil, such as the highly cohesive Boston Blue type clay. The soil dipersants of the present invention are therefore capable of dispersing the soil matrix in a much more rigorous environment, compared to previous soil dispersants which were used to disperse small portions of bentonite clay in aqueous suspensions, such as a drilling mud. Additionally, the soil dispersants used in the present method are capable of maintaining workability of the soil matrix even after cementitious binder has been introduced to the mixture, while prior dispersants could not prevent immediate flocculation of the binder/soil mixture. Since it is preferred that reinforcing steel be placed into the soil/dispersant/binder mixture prior to setting, it is necessary that premature flocculation of the mixture be avoided.</p><p>In the present soil stabilization method, the soil dispersant is introduced, or injected, into the soil in an amount of about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the soil to be treated. As the dispersant is injected in situ, the weight of the soil to be treated can be estimated based upon the volume to be treated and the measured or calculated density of the soil. Preferably, the soil dispersant is injected into the soil in an amount of about 0.5% to about 2% by weight of soil.</p><p>The acrylic acid polymer, copolymer, or blended polymer soil dispersants of the present invention can be utilized in either the acid form, particularly when introduced into the soil together with the cementitious binder, or as salts of the acid, which is the preferred mode when introduced into the soil prior to the introduction of the cement binder. Most preferably, the acrylic acid polymer, copolymer or blended polymer soil dispersant is a salt of lithium, sodium, potassium, ammonium, or mixtures of the salts. Generally, the pH of the soil dispersant formulation should be above about 6, and preferably the pH of is above about 7.</p><p>In certain embodiments, the acrylic acid/sulfonic acid copolymer dispersant of the present invention may contain at least one of vinyl sulfonic residues or acrylimidomethanepropane sulfonic residues, in order to introduce the sulfonic moiety into the polymer. In another embodiment, the soil dispersant is a graft polymer comprising a ketone-aldehyde condensation or co-condensation product or their salts, wherein the product comprises:</p><p>a) a ketone containing aliphatic, araliphatic, cyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, provided at least one radical is nonaromatic;</p><p>b) an aldehyde of the formula R--(CHO).sub.n, wherein n=1 to 2 and R is hydrogen or an aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic radical; and,</p><p>c) an acid group selected from carboxyl, sulfo, sulfamido, sulfoxy, sulfoalkylamine and sulfoalkyloxy;</p><p>to which product at least one of anionic, nonionic, and cationic unsaturated monomers are grafted.</p><p>Preferably, the soil dispersant of the present invention is at least one of a sodium salt of polyacrylic acid, an acrylic acid sulfonic acid copolymer, an ammonium salt of an acrylic acid sulfonic acid copolymer, a sodium salt of an acrylic acid sulfonic acid copolymer and a blend of an acrylic acid polymer with a sulfonic acid copolymer or salts thereof. Representative examples of suitable soil dispersants according to the present invention include but are not limited to ACCUMER salt of acrylic acid/sulfonic acid copolymer, ACCUMER salt of polyacrylic acid, ACCUMER acid, GOOD-RITE POLYTHIN ACCUMER GOOD-RITE trademark of SKW Trostberg AG. The soil dispersant is also referred to herein as the clay dispersant, in accord with a particular embodiment of the invention.</p><p>In order to provide optimum workability of the soil, it is preferred that the weight average molecular weight of said soil dispersant is below about 10,000. It is most preferred that the weight average molecular weight of said soil dispersant is about 2,000 to about 5,000.</p><p>According to the present invention, the cementitious binder used in the deep mix soil stabilization system of the present invention is selected from hydraulic cement, lime, fly ash and their mixtures. Preferably the cementitious binder is a portland cement grout. The cementitious binder may additionally contain a pozzolan, such as fly ash, silica fume, rice husk ash, natural pozzolans, metakaolinite, and blast furnace slag. A preferred range of cement to soil is about 5 to about 50% by weight.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cement grout also contains a cement dispersant other than the soil dispersant. This aids in reducing the water/cement ratio of the grout, so that ultimately the cement and water content of the stabilized soil is reduced, while maintaining the desired strength. The use of the cement dispersant lowers the viscosity of the grout leading to compressive strength development, and can also enhance the initial workability of the soil. Any cement dispersant compatible with the soil dispersant may be utilized, but lignosulfonates, beta naphthalenesulfonates and their mixtures are preferred. The cement dispersant may be added in amounts conventional to the industry, preferably about 0.05 to about 1.5% by weight based on the weight of the cement.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The following terms are defined for purposes of this specification.

The present invention provides a deep mix soil stabilization method which avoids premature flocculation of the soil and cement grout mixture to permit thorough mixing of the soil and grout and the introduction of reinforcements into the soil-cement structure, by the use of the soil dispersants described and exemplified above. The present invention further provides a deep mix soil stabilization method which provides lower viscosity of the soil-cement mixture, and enhances compressive strength development of the stabilized soil-cement structure by the use of cement dispersants in combination with the soil dispersants. The cement dispersant-soil dispersant combination enhances the initial workability of the soil, and permits reduction of the water cement ratio of the grout. The compressive strength is therefore enhanced, which permits a reduction in the cement content of the stabilized soil to achieve the same strength.</p><p>Thus it is demonstrated that the objects of the present invention are met.
