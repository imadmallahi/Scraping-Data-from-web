Peptide ligands within the context of the present invention are generally constrained (that is, having some element of structure as, for example, the presence of amino acids which initiate a β turn or β pleated sheet, or for example, cyclized by the presence of disulfide-bonded Cys residues) or unconstrained (linear) amino acid sequences of less than about 50 amino acid residues, and preferably less than about 40 amino acids residues. Of the peptide ligands less than about 40 amino acid residues, preferred are the peptide ligands of between about 10 arid about 30 amino acid residues and especially the peptide ligands of about 20 amino acid residues. However, upon reading the instant disclosure, the skilled artisan will recognize that it is not the length of a particular peptide ligand but its ability to bind a particular target molecule that distinguishes the peptide ligand of the present invention. Therefore peptide ligands of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 amino acid residues, for example, are equally likely to be peptide ligands within the context of the present invention.</p><p num="p0021">A peptide ligand of the present invention will bind a target molecule with sufficient affinity and specificity if the peptide ligand "homes" to, "binds" or "targets" a target molecule such as a specific cell type bearing the target molecule <i>in vitro</i> and preferably <i>in vivo (see,</i> for example,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the use of the term "homes to," "homing," and "targets" in <nplcit id="ncit0021" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Pasqualini and Ruoslahti (1996) Nature, 380:364-366</text></nplcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0022" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Arap et al., (1998) Science, 279:377-380</text></nplcit>). In general, the peptide ligand will bind a target molecule with an affinity characterized by a dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>, of less than about 1 µM, preferably less than about 100 nM and more preferably less than about 10 nM. However, peptide ligands having an affinity for a target molecule of less than about 1 nM and preferably between about 1 pM and 1 nM are equally likely to be peptide ligands within the context of the present invention. In general a peptide ligand that binds a particular target molecule as described above can be isolated and identified by any of a number of art-standard techniques as described herein.</p><p num="p0022">Peptides ligands are amino acid sequences as described above which may contain naturally as well as non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. Therefore, so-called "peptide mimetics" and "peptide analogs" which may include non-amino acid chemical structures that mimic the structure of a particular amino acid or peptide may be peptide ligands within the context of the invention. Such mimetics or analogs are characterized generally as exhibiting similar physical characteristics such as size, charge or hydrophobicity present in the appropriate spacial orientation as found in their peptide counterparts. A specific example of a peptide mimetic compound is a compound in which the amide bond between one or more of the amino acids is replaced by, for example, a carbon-carbon bond or other bond as is well known in the art <i>(see,</i> for example <nplcit id="ncit0023" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Sawyer, in Peptide Based Drug Design pp. 378-422 (ACS, Washington DC 1995</text></nplcit>)).</p><p num="p0023">Therefore, the term "amino acid" within the scope of the present invention is used in its broadest sense and is meant to include naturally occurring L α-amino acids or residues. The commonly used one and three letter abbreviations for naturally occurring amino acids are used herein (<nplcit id="ncit0024" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Lehninger, A.L., Biochemistry, 2d ed., pp. 71-92, (1975), Worth Publishers, New York</text></nplcit>). The correspondence between the standard single letter codes and the standard three letter codes is well known to the skilled artisan, and is reproduced here: A = Ala; C = Cys; D = Asp; E = Glu; F = Phe; G = Gly; H = His; I = Ile; K = Lys; L = Leu; M = Met; N = Asn; P = Pro; Q = Gln; R = Arg; S = Ser; T = Thr; V = Val; W = Trp; Y = Tyr. The term includes D-amino acids as well as chemically modified amino acids such as amino acid analogs, naturally occurring amino acids that are not usually incorporated into proteins such as norleucine, and chemically synthesized compounds having properties known in the art to be characteristic of an amino acid. For example, analogs or mimetics of phenylalanine or proline, which allow the same conformational restriction of the peptide compounds as natural Phe or Pro are included within the definition of amino acid. Such analogs and mimetics are referred to herein as "functional equivalents" of an amino acid. Other examples of amino acids are listed by<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><nplcit id="ncit0025" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Roberts and Vellaccio The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Gross and Meiehofer, eds., Vol. 5 p. 341, Academic Press, Inc., N.Y. 1983</text></nplcit>, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="p0024">Peptide ligands synthesized by, for example, standard solid phase synthesis techniques, are not limited to amino acids encoded by genes. Commonly encountered amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, include, for example, those described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9001940A" status="new"><text>International Publication No. WO 90/01940</text></patcit> such as, for example, 2-amino adipic acid (Aad) for Glu and Asp; 2-aminopimelic acid (Apm). for Glu and Asp; 2-aminobutyric (Abu) acid for Met, Leu, and other aliphatic amino acids; 2-aminoheptanoic acid (Ahe) for Met, Leu and other aliphatic amino acids; 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) for Gly; cyclohexylalanine (Cha) for Val, and Leu and Ile; homoarginine (Har) for Arg and Lys; 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dpr) for Lys, Arg and His; N-ethylglycine (EtGly) for Gly, Pro, and Ala; N-ethylglycine (EtGly) for Gly, Pro, and Ala; N-ethylasparigine (EtAsn) for Asn, and Gln; Hydroxyllysine (Hyl) for Lys; allohydroxyllysine (AHyl) for Lys; 3-(and 4)-hydoxyproline (3Hyp, 4Hyp) for Pro, Ser, and Thr; allo-isoleucine (AIle) for Ile, Leu, and Val; ρ-amidinophenylalanine for Ala; N-methylglycine (MeGly, sarcosine) for Gly, Pro, and Ala; N-methylisoleucine (Melle) for Ile; Norvaline (Nva) for Met and other aliphatic amino acids; Norleucine (Nle) for Met and other aliphatic amino acids; Ornithine (Orn) for Lys, Arg and His; Citrulline (Cit) and methionine sulfoxide (MSO) for Thr, Asn and Gln; N-methylphenylalanine (MePhe), trimethylphenylalanine, halo (F, Cl, Br, and I) phenylalanine, trifluorylphenylalanine, for Phe.</p><p num="p0025">Peptide ligands within the context of the present invention may be "engineered", <i>i.e.,</i> they are non-native or non-naturally occurring peptide ligands. By "non-native" or "non-naturally occurring" is meant that the amino acid sequence of the particular peptide ligand is not found in nature. That is to say, amino acid sequences of non-native or non-naturally occurring peptide ligands do not correspond to an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring protein or polypeptide. Peptide ligands of this variety may be produced or selected using a variety of techniques well known to the skilled artisan. For example, constrained or unconstrained peptide libraries may be randomly generated and displayed on phage utilizing art standard techniques, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0026" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Lowman et al., (1998) Biochemistry 37:8870-8878</text></nplcit>.</p><p num="p0026">Peptide ligands, when used within the context of the present invention, may be "conjugated" to a therapeutic or diagnostic substance. The term "conjugated" is used in its broadest sense to encompass all methods of attachment or joining that are known in the art. For example, in a typical embodiment, the therapeutic or diagnostic substance is a protein (referred to herein as a "protein therapeutic"), and the peptide ligand will be an amino acid extension of the Cor N-terminus of the protein therapeutic. In addition, a short amino acid linker sequence may lie between the protein therapeutic and the peptide ligand. In this scenario, the peptide ligand,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> optional tinker and protein therapeutic will be coded for by a nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding protein therapeutic operably linked to (in the sense that the DNA sequences are contiguous and in reading frame) an optional linker sequence encoding a short polypeptide as described below, and a sequence encoding the peptide ligand. In this typical scenario, the peptide ligand is considered to be "conjugated" to the protein therapeutic optionally via a linker sequence. In a related embodiment, the peptide ligand amino acid sequence may interrupt or replace a section of the protein therapeutic amino acid sequence, provided, of course, that the insertion of the peptide ligand amino acid sequence does not interfere with the function of the protein therapeutic. In this embodiment, the "conjugate" may be coded for by a nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding protein therapeutic interrupted by and operably linked to a sequence encoding the peptide ligand. In a further typical embodiment, the peptide will be linked, <i>e.g.,</i> by chemical conjugation to the protein therapeutic or other therapeutic optionally via a linker sequence. Typically, according to this embodiment, the peptide ligand will be linked to the protein therapeutic via a side chain of an amino acid somewhere in the middle of the protein therapeutic that doesn't interfere with the therapeutic's activity. Here again, the peptide is considered to be "conjugated" to the therapeutic.</p><p num="p0027">As used within the context of the present invention the term "target molecule" includes, proteins, peptides, glycoproteins, glycopeptides, glycolipids, polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, and the like. Target molecules include, for example, extracellular molecules such as various serum factors including but not limited to plasma proteins such as serum albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins or transferrin, or proteins found on the surface of erythrocytes or lymphocytes, provided, of course, that binding of the peptide ligand to the cell surface protein does not substantially interfere with the normal function of the cell.</p><p num="p0028">"Antibodies" and "immunoglobulins" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 Daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains.</p><p num="p0029">Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments or regions, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment or region. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof.</p><p num="p0030">Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. The Fab' fragment contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CHl) of the heavy chain.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p num="p0031">"Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.</p><p num="p0032">"Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, <i>etc.</i> Preferably, the mammal is human.</p><p num="p0033">A "disorder" is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the compositions comprising the peptide ligands of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question.</p><p num="p0034">"Elimination half-time" is used in its ordinary sense, as is described in <nplcit id="ncit0027" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Goodman and Gillman's The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics 21-25 (Alfred Goodman Gilman, Louis S. Goodman, and Alfred Gilman, eds., 6th ed. 1980</text></nplcit>). Briefly, the term is meant to encompass a quantitative measure of the time course of drug elimination. The elimination of most drugs is exponential (i.e., follows first-order kinetics), since drug concentrations usually do not approach those required for saturation of the elimination process. The rate of an exponential process may be expressed by its rate constant, k, which expresses the fractional change per unit of time, or by its half-time, t<sub>½</sub>, the time required for 50% completion of the process. The units of these two constants are time<sup>-1</sup> and time, respectively. A first-order rate constant and the half-time of the reaction are simply related (k x t<sub>½</sub> = 0.693) and may be interchanged accordingly. Since first-order elimination kinetics dictates that a constant fraction of drug is lost per unit time, a plot of the log of drug concentration versus time is linear at all times following the initial distribution phase <i>(i.e.</i> after drug absorption and distribution are complete). The half-time for drug elimination can be accurately determined from such a graph.</p><p num="p0035">"Transfection" refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO<sub>4</sub> precipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.</p><p num="p0036">"Transformation" means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of <nplcit id="ncit0028" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning (2nd ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY (1989</text></nplcit>), is generally used for prokaryotes or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers.

For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method described in sections 16.30-16.37 of Sambrook <i>et al., supra,</i> is preferred.

Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor.

The bioactive compounds of the invention include any compound useful as a therapeutic or diagnostic agent. Non-limiting examples of bioactive compounds include polypeptides such as enzymes, hormones, cytokines, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as organic compounds such as analgesics, antipyretics, antiinflammatory agents, antibiotics, antiviral agents, anti-fungal<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> drugs, cardiovascular drugs, drugs that affect renal function and electrolyte metabolism, drugs that act on the central nervous system, chemotherapeutic drugs, etc. According to the present invention the peptide ligand domain is joined to an active domain, optionally via a flexible linker domain.</p><p num="p0059">The hybrid molecules of the present invention are constructed by combining a peptide ligand domain with a suitable active domain. Depending on the type of linkage and its method of production, the peptide ligand domain may be joined via its N- or C-terminus to the N- or C-terminus of the active domain. For example, when preparing the hybrid molecules of the present invention via recombinant techniques, nucleic acid encoding a peptide ligand will be operably linked to nucleic acid encoding the active domain sequence, optionally via a linker domain. Typically the construct encodes a fusion protein wherein the C-terminus of the peptide ligand is joined to the N-terminus of the active domain. However, especially when synthetic techniques are employed, fusions where, for example, the N-terminus of the peptide ligand is joined to the N- or C-terminus of the active domain also are possible. In some instances, the peptide ligand domain may be inserted within the active domain molecule rather than being joined to the active domain at its N-or C-terminus. This configuration may be used to practice the invention so long as the functions of the peptide ligand domain and the active domain are preserved. For example, a peptide ligand may be inserted into a non-binding light chain CDR of an immunoglobulin without interfering with the ability of the immunoglobulin to bind to its target. Regions of active domain molecules that can accommodate peptide ligand domain insertions may be identified empirically <i>(i.e.,</i> by selecting an insertion site, randomly, and assaying the resulting conjugate for the function of the active domain), or by sequence comparisons amongst a family of related active domain molecules (e.g., for active domains that are proteins) to locate regions of low sequence homology. Low sequence homology regions are more likely to tolerate insertions of peptide ligands domains than are regions that are well-conserved. For active domain molecules whose three-dimensional structures are known (e.g. from X-ray crystallographic or NMR studies), the three-dimensional structure may provide guidance as to peptide ligand insertion sites. For example, loops or regions with high mobility (i.e., large temperature or "B" factors) are more likely to accommodate peptide ligand domain insertions than are highly ordered regions of the structure, or regions involved in ligand binding or catalysis.</p><heading><b>C. <u style="single">Linker Domains</u></b></heading><p num="p0060">According to the present invention, the peptide ligand domain is optionally linked to the active domain via a linker. The linker component of the hybrid molecule of the invention does not necessarily participate in but may contribute to the function of the hybrid molecule. Therefore,<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> according to the present invention, the linker domain, is any group of molecules that provides a spatial bridge between the active domain and the peptide ligand domain.</p><p num="p0061">The linker domain can be of variable length and makeup, however, according to the present invention, it is the length of the linker domain and not its structure that is important. The linker domain preferably allows for the peptide ligand domain of the hybrid molecule to bind, substantially free of steric and/or conformational restrictions to the target molecule. Therefore, the length of the linker domain is dependent upon the character of the two "functional" domains of the hybrid molecule, <i>i.e.</i>, the peptide ligand domain and the active domain.</p><p num="p0062">One skilled in the art will recognize that various combinations of atoms provide for variable length molecules based upon known distances between various bonds (<nplcit id="ncit0034" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Morrison, and Boyd, Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed, Allyn and Bacon, Inc., Boston, MA (1977</text></nplcit>)). For example, the linker domain may be a polypeptide of variable length. The amino acid composition of the polypeptide determines the character and length of the linker.

Following deprotection of the initial amino acid's α-amino group, the next α-amino and side chain protected amino acid in the synthesis is added. The remaining α-amino and, if necessary, side chain protected amino acids are then coupled sequentially in the desired order by condensation to obtain an intermediate compound connected to the solid support. Alternatively, some amino acids may be coupled to one another to form a fragment of the desired peptide followed by addition of the peptide fragment to the growing solid phase peptide chain.</p><p num="p0079">The condensation reaction between two amino acids, or an amino acid and a peptide, or a peptide and a peptide can be carried out according to the usual condensation methods such as the axide method, mixed acid anhydride method, DCC (N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) or DIC (N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide) methods, active ester method, p-nitrophenyl ester method, BOP (benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris [dimethylamino] phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) method, N-hydroxysuccinic acid imido ester method, <i>etc.,</i> and Woodward reagent K method.</p><p num="p0080">It is common in the chemical synthesis of peptides to protect any reactive side chain groups of the amino acids with suitable protecting groups. Ultimately, these protecting groups are removed after the desired polypeptide chain has been sequentially assembled. Also common is the protection of the α-amino group on an amino acid or peptide fragment while the C-terminal carboxy group of the amino acid or peptide fragment reacts with the free N-terminal amino group of the growing solid phase polypeptide chain, followed by the selective removal of the α-amino group to permit the addition of the next amino acid or peptide fragment to the solid phase polypeptide chain. Accordingly, it is common in polypeptide synthesis that an intermediate compound is produced which contains each of the amino acid residues located in the desired sequence in the peptide chain wherein individual residues still carry side-chain protecting groups. These protecting groups can be removed substantially at the same time to produce the desired polypeptide product following removal from the solid phase.</p><p num="p0081">α- and ε-amino side chains can be protected with benzyloxycarbonyl (abbreviated Z), isonicotinyloxycarbonyl (iNOC), o-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl [Z(2Cl)], p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl [Z(NO<sub>2</sub>)], p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl [Z(OMe)], t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), t-amyloxycarbonyl<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> (Aoc), isobornyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, 2-(4-biphenyl)-2-propyloxycarbonyl (Bpoc), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), methylsulfonyethoxycarbonyl (Msc), trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, formyl, 2-nitrophenylsulphenyl (NPS), diphenylphosphinothioyl (Ppt), and dimethylphosphinothioyl (Mpt) groups, and the like.</p><p num="p0082">Protective groups for the carboxy functional group are exemplified by benzyl ester (OBzl), cyclohexyl ester (Chx), 4-nitrobenzyl ester (ONb), t-butyl ester (Obut), 4-pyridylmethyl ester (OPic), and the like. It is often desirable that specific amino acids such as arginine, cysteine, and serine possessing a functional group other than amino and carboxyl groups are protected by a suitable protective group. For example, the guanidino group of arginine may be protected with nitro, p-toluenesulfonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzesulfonyl, 4-methoxy-2,6-dimethylbenzenesulfonyl (Nds), 1,3,5-trimethylphenysulfonyl (Mts), and the like.

The peptide is removed from the solid support by a reagent capable of disrupting the peptide-solid phase link, and optionally deprotects blocked side chain functional groups on the peptide. In one embodiment, the peptide is cleaved away from the solid phase by acidolysis with liquid hydrofluoric acid (HF), which also removes any remaining side chain protective groups. Preferably, in order to avoid alkylation of residues in the peptide (for example, alkylation of methionine, cysteine, and tyrosine residues), the acidolysis reaction mixture contains thio-cresol and cresol scavengers. Following HF cleavage, the resin is washed with ether, and the free peptide is extracted from the solid phase with sequential washes of acetic acid solutions.

It will be appreciated that the invention encompasses macromolecules complexed with the peptide ligands or hybrid molecules. In a preferred embodiment, the peptide ligands of the invention are directed against an immunoglobulin, such as, <i>e.g.,</i> the IgG-Fc peptide ligands disclosed <i>infra.</i> Such peptide ligands may be used as affinity purification agents. In this process, the peptide ligands are immobilized on a solid phase support such as a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized peptide ligand is contacted with a sample containing the immunoglobulin protein (or fragment thereof) to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the immunoglobulin protein, which is bound to the immobilized peptide ligand. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will release the immunoglobulin protein from the peptide ligand.</p><p num="p0108">In general, the solid support is an inert matrix, such as a polymeric gel, comprising a three-dimensional structure, lattice or network of a material. Almost any macromolecule, synthetic or natural, can form a gel in a suitable liquid when suitably cross-linked with abifunctional reagent. Preferably, the macromolecule selected is convenient for use in affinity chromatography. Most chromatographic matrices used for affinity chromatography are xerogels. Such gels shrink on drying to a compact solid comprising only the gel matrix. When the dried xerogel is resuspended in the liquid, the gel matrix imbibes liquid, swells and returns to the gel state. Xerogels suitable for use herein include polymeric gels, such as cellulose, cross-linked dextrans (e.g. Sepharose), agarose; cross-linked agarose, polyacrylamide gels, and polyacrylamide-agarose gels.</p><p num="p0109">Alternatively, aerogels can be used for affinity chromatography. These gels do not shrink on drying but merely allow penetration of the surrounding air. When the dry gel is exposed to liquid, the latter displaces the air in the gel. Aerogels suitable for use herein include porous glass and ceramic gels.</p><p num="p0110">Also encompassed herein are the peptide ligands or hybrid molecules of the invention coupled to derivatized gels wherein the derivative moieties facilitate the coupling of the hybrid molecules to the gel matrix and avoid steric hindrance of the peptide ligand-target molecule<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> interaction in affinity chromatography. Alternatively, spacer arms can be interposed between the gel matrix and the hybrid molecules for similar benefits.</p><p num="p0111">A variation on the above contemplates the use of gene fusions and the use of the peptide ligands as purification reagents. According to this aspect of the invention the gene encoding a peptide ligand is associated, in a vector, with a gene encoding another protein or a fragment of another protein. This results in the peptide ligand being produced by the host cell as a fusion with another protein or peptide. The "other" protein or peptide is often a protein or peptide which can be secreted by the cell, making it possible to isolate and purify the other protein from the culture medium and eliminating the necessity of destroying the host cells which arises when the other protein remains inside the cell. Alternatively, the fusion protein can be expressed intracellularly. It is useful to use fusion proteins that are highly expressed.</p><p num="p0112">The use of gene fusions is analogous to the use of Protein A fusions which are often used because the binding of protein A, or more specifically the Z domain of protein A binds toIgG and provides an "affinity handle" for the purification of the fused protein. According to a preferred aspect of the invention, peptide ligands which bind serum albumin are use as "affinity handles" for the purification of fused proteins on a solid serum albumin support. For example, a DNA sequence encoding the desired peptide ligand can be fused by site directed mutagenesis to the gene for protein. After expression and secretion, the fusion protein can be purified on a matix of serum albumin to which the peptide ligand will bind. After purification the peptide ligand can be enzymatically or chemically cleaved to yield free protein or left intact to aid in increasing the elimination half life of the fused protein. Fusion proteins can be cleaved using chemicals, such as cyanogen bromide, which cleaves at a methionine, or hydroxylamine, which cleaves between an Asn and Gly residue. Using standard recombinant DNA methodology, the nucleotide base pairs encoding these amino acids may be inserted just prior to the 5' end of the gene encoding the desired peptide. Alternatively, one can employ proteolytic cleavage of fusion protein. <nplcit id="ncit0055" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Carter, in Protein Purification: From Molecular Mechanisms to Large-Scale Processes, Ladisch et al., eds.

These libraries also were sorted against IgG-Fc for six rounds and then sequenced.</p><p num="p0120">After screening against IgG-Fc, the consensus patterns from these libraries suggested a highly conserved 13-residue core sequence (Asp-Cys-Ala-Trp-His-Leu-Gly-Glu-Leu-Val-Trp-Cys-Thr) (SEQ ID NO: 9). The corresponding peptide (Fc-III) was synthesized and found to inhibit binding of Protein A (Z-domain) to Fc with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 100 nM. Thus, although Fc-III is<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> seven residues shorter than Fc-II, it binds 50-times more tightly. Despite its smaller size, the binding affinity of Fc-III to Fc was only ten-fold weaker than that of the domains from Protein A and Protein G, which are each about four times larger and bind with K<sub>d</sub>S around 10 nM. <nplcit id="ncit0059" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>S.
