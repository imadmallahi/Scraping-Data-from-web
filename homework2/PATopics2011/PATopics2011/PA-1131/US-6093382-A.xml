Reported Developments</p><p>The folate-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents of the present application are designed for use in Nuclear Medicine, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and neutron capture therapy applications. Magnetic resonance (hereinafter sometimes referred to as MR) imaging is well known and widely used by the prior art for obtaining spatial images of parts of a patient for clinical diagnosis. The image is obtained by placing the patient in a strong external magnetic field and observing the effect of this field on the magnetic properties of protons contained in and surrounding the organ or tissue of the patient. The proton relaxation times, called T.sub.1 or spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time, and T.sub.2 or spin-spin or transverse relaxation time depend on the chemical and physical environment of the organ or tissue being imaged. In order to improve the clarity of the image, a diagnostic agent is administered intravenously (hereinafter sometimes referred to as I.V.) and is taken up by the organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes to enhance the contrast between healthy and diseased tissues.</p><p>The contrast agents used in MR imaging derive their signal-enhancing effect from the inclusion of a material exhibiting paramagnetic, ferrimagnetic, ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic behavior. These materials affect the characteristic relaxation times of the imaging nuclei in the body regions into which they distribute causing an increase or decrease in MR signal intensity. There is a need for contrast agents such as those of the present invention, that selectively enhance signal intensity in particular tissue types, as most MR contrast agents are relatively non-specific in their distribution.</p><p>Nuclear medicine procedures and treatments are based on internally distributed radioactive materials, such as radiopharmaceuticals or radionuclides, which emit electromagnetic radiations as gamma rays or photons. Following I.V., oral or inhalation administration, the gamma rays are readily detected and quantified within the body using instrumentation such as scintillation and gamma cameras. The gamma-emitting agents of the present invention are designed to selectively localize in particular targeted tissues by transmembrane transport, yielding either high signal intensity in these tissue types for imaging purposes, or high radiation dose, for radiotherapy purposes.</p><p>Transmembrane transport of exogenous molecules, such as diagnostic agents, is also known by the prior art. One method of transmembrane delivery, receptor-mediated endocytosis, is the movement of extracellular ligands bound to cell surface receptors into the interior of the cells through invagination of the membrane. This process is initiated by the binding of a ligand to its specific receptor. Folates, which are required for the survival and growth of eukaryotic cells, are taken up into cells by receptor-mediated transport after binding to folate binding protein on the cell membrane. The cellular uptake of exogenous molecules can be enhanced by conjugation of these molecules to folate. Such conjugates have been used to target folate receptors to enhance cellular uptake of exogenous molecules, including some diagnostic agents. The uptake of substances by receptor-mediated endocytosis (hereinafter sometimes termed RME) is a characteristic ability of some normal, healthy cells. RME transport systems have been found on normal macrophages, hepatocytes, fibroblasts and reticulocytes. On the other hand, conversion of normal cells into tumor cells can be associated with an increase or decrease in the activity of receptors performing RME or, sometimes, with changes in the levels of receptor expression.</p><p>The use of neutron capture therapy for the treatment of cancer is well known to those skilled in the art. Briefly the system comprises administering a target substance that emits short-range radiation when it is irradiated with neutrons. Boron-10 has traditionally been used for neutron capture therapy, but more recently Gadolinium-157, which has a very high cross section for neutrons and emits short range Auger-electrons, has been used. [Brugger, R. M. and Shih, J. A., Strahlentherapie Und Onkologie, 165, 153-156, 1989; Brugger, R. M. and Shih, J. A., Medical Physics, 19, 733-744, 1992]. Specificity is achieved by using neutrons of appropriate energy and the selective distribution of the gadolinium within the tumor tissue. In the past, neutron capture therapy has suffered from insufficient concentration of target substance in the desired cells and in the case of gadolinium, has suffered from the exclusion of the gadolinium from the inside of the cell. The use of the folate-containing gadolinium compounds of this invention is advantageous because of the large amounts of gadolinium that are specifically taken up by the desired cells. The internalization of the compounds of this invention following binding to folate binding protein is beneficial because of the short range of the Auger electrons. In addition, the gadolinium compounds of this invention can be used as MRI contrast agents that selectively target the cells that are to be treated by neutron capture therapy. The imaging data can provide the radiotherapist with spatial information beneficial for planning the radiotherapy procedure, using the same gadolinium atoms as are used as the target for the neutrons.</p><p>The following illustrative studies describe relevant properties of the folate receptor.</p><p>Folic acid or pteroyl glutamic acid is a vitamin consisting of a pteridine ring linked by a methylene bridge to a para-aminobenzoic acid moiety, which is joined through an amide linkage to a glutamic acid residue. Folic acid and folates are well absorbed from the diet primarily via the proximal portion of the small intestine. Following their absorption from the digestive system, dietary folates are rapidly reduced by dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes to tetrahydrofolic acid and derivatives thereof.</p><p>Folates are required for the survival and growth of eukaryotic cells, so their cellular uptake is assured by at least two independent transport mechanisms. Reduced folates are internalized via a carrier-mediated low affinity (K.sub.m 1-5 μM) anion-transport system that is found in nearly all cells. Folic acid and 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate can also enter cells via a high affinity (K.sub.d values in the nanomolar range) membrane-bound folate-binding protein (hereinafter sometimes referred to as FBP) that is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (hereinafter sometimes referred to as GPI) moiety. This process has been studied in MA104 cells, where experiments have shown that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is taken up into the cell after binding to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored FBP that has clustered in cell structures known as caveolae. The caveolae then seal the folate binding protein-folate complex off from the extracellular space and transport folate into the cell. Once inside, the folate dissociates from FBP and diffuses into the cytoplasm, where it is rapidly coupled to one or more glutamic acid residue, slowing diffusion out of the cell. The caveolae and FBP then migrate to the membrane surface for another round of folate uptake.</p><p>There are two major isoforms of the human membrane folate binding proteins, α and β. The two isoforms have ˜70% amino acid sequence homology, and differ dramatically in their stereospecificity for some folates. Both isoforms are expressed in both fetal and adult tissue; normal tissue generally expresses low to moderate amounts of FR-β. FR-α is expressed in normal epithelial cells and is frequently strikingly elevated in a variety of carcinomas, with the exception of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Several papers have reported the overexpression of folate binding protein in cancer.

Kidneys may, as a result, be a significant source of toxicity. Folic acid in high doses has been reported to be nephrotoxic and a kidney-specific tumor promoter, as it is rapidly concentrated in the kidney and precipitated in the tubules as urinary pH drops, causing obstructive nephropathy. This injury results in diffuse renal cell proliferation and hypertrophy. Rats given i.v. injections of folic acid (250 mg/kg) in 0.3 M sodium bicarbonate showed an increase in the ratio of kidney to body weight that reached 165% of control by 24 h after treatment.

The amount of FBP on the membrane of ovarian cancer cells is high (1 H folic acid at a level of 10-12 pmol/10.sup.6 cells; MA104 cells bind 1-2 pmol folic acid/10.sup.6 cells. FBP has a very high affinity for folic acid and some of its reduced folate cofactors (K.sub.d ˜1-10 nM); this presumably favors folate uptake at the usual folate concentrations that exist in vivo (5-50 nM). The recycling rate for the folate binding protein (in vitro) has been reported to range from ˜30 min in MA104 cells to 5 hr in L1210 cells. Several antifolate drugs have been shown to bind to FBP; these compounds, of which methotrexate is characteristic, have been used to antagonize the growth of cancer cells.

FBP levels are low in many normal tissue types while, in comparison, FBP levels are high in many tumor cells. This difference between the folate receptor levels allows selective concentration of pharmaceutical or diagnostic agents in tumor cells relative to normal cells, thereby facilitating treatment or visualization of tumor cells.</p><p>In culture, cells were successfully targeted through FBP using folate-conjugated protein toxins that would not normally penetrate the cell membrane through diffusion, as well as with folate-derivatized druglantisense oligonucleotide-carrying liposomes.

No. 5,416,016 and WO 96/36367 (Low et al.) are directed to a method for enhancing transmembrane transport of exogenous molecules and disclose such delivery wherein the method comprises: contacting a membrane of a living cell with a complex formed between an exogenous molecule and a ligand of folic acid and folate analogs to initiate receptor-mediated transmembrane transport of the ligand complex. The exogenous molecules include a large variety of compounds, peptides, proteins and nucleic acids, analgesics, antihypertensive agents, antiviral agents, antihistamines, cancer drugs, expectorants, vitamins, plasmids and diagnostic agents.</p><p>The synthetic methods described in these documents were not regioselective, and mixtures containing folic acid coupled to the exogenous molecule through either the α- or γ-carboxylate of folate are expected to form. In the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016 these mixtures were not separated.</p><p>WO 96/36367 distinguishes between the two isomers of DF-folates, i.e., those where deferoxamine is coupled to the folate moiety through the α- or through the γ-carboxyl group of folate, based on their competition with free folate for the cell surface FBP: it was found that the α-conjugate was unable to compete with free folate for the cell surface FBP. In a comparative test a 50% decrease in bound [.sup.3 H] folic acid was observed in the presence of an equimolar amount of the DF-folate (γ) conjugate, while the DF-folate (α) isomer displayed no ability to compete with the radiolabeled vitamin.</p><p>Wang et al., supra, studied the uptake of .sup.67 Ga-deferoxamine-folate into KB tumor cells (a human nasopharyngeal epidermal carcinoma cell line that greatly overexpresses the folate binding protein) as a potential radiopharmaceutical. When 0.15 μCi (100 pmol) of .sup.67 Ga-DF-folate (deferoxamine coupled to folic acid via the γ-carboxylate of folate) was incubated with monolayers of KB cells, the final % uptake of the compound by the KB cells was 32% of the applied radioactivity. The compound had very low non-specific binding as indicated by very low activity levels bound to a receptor-negative cell line control.</p><p>Wang et al. subsequently published another report* stating that folic acid derivatives that are modified at the alpha carboxylate have no affinity for cell surface folate receptors. They reported the preparation of FITC-EDA-folate derivatives containing a fluorescein moiety (FITC) linked to folate through either the α- or γ-carboxylate of folate (via an ethylenediamine [EDA] spacer). The two isomers were incubated with KB cells that overexpress FBP. The cells were then washed to remove unbound compound and assayed for cell-associated fluorescence. The γ-isomer of FITC-EDA-folate showed half maximal binding to KB cells at a concentration of 1.6 nM (binding comparable to native folate), but the α-isomer of FYIC-EDA-folate had "virtually no affinity for the cell surface receptors".</p><p>*Wang, Susan; Luo, Jin; Lantrip, Douglas A.; Waters, David J.; Mathias, Carla J.; Green, Mark A.; Fuchs, Philip L.; Low, Philip S.

(1997), 8(5), 673-679.</p><p>The folate-based agents of the present application were designed for use in nuclear medicine, neutron capture therapy, or MRI applications. Based on the teachings in WO96/36367 that only folate adducts coupled to exogenous molecules through the gamma carboxylate of folate are recognized by FBP, we devised regiospecific syntheses for the preparation of these folate conjugates, rather than using the non-regiospecific methods used by others. The conjugates prepared by these regiospecific routes contained metal chelating ligands coupled to folate through its gamma carboxylate. The corresponding alpha isomers were prepared for use as negative controls. Surprisingly, when the ability of the alpha and gamma isomers to bind to FBP in tumor cells in vitro was compared, the alpha isomers (our "negative" controls) bound to FBP to the same extent as the gamma isomers in a variety of in vitro studies (vide infra). This result was surprising in light of the reports of Wang et al. Also surprising was our subsequent finding that folate compounds derivatized with metal chelates at both the alpha and gamma carboxylate of folate (bis derivatives) were also able to bind to FBP.</p><p>We also performed studies with the alpha and gamma isomers in tumor-bearing animals, where ability of the alpha isomers to localize in the tumors was surprisingly found to be equal to or greater than that observed with the corresponding gamma conjugates. In addition, the clearance behavior of the two isomers was compared, both in vivo and in vitro. As discussed in greater detail later, the urinary clearance of the alpha isomers from the body was significantly and unexpectedly higher than that observed with the corresponding γ-isomer or with .sup.3 H folate. This may be an advantage for some nuclear medicine and radiotherapy applications for these compounds, because retention in non-target organs causes higher radiation dose to the patient and lower target to background ratios. Compounds that are more rapidly excreted from the body provide an improved margin of safety.</p><p>We have also discovered that the alpha isomers of the folate conjugates of the present invention also show unexpectedly faster clearance from cells in vitro. Studies were performed to compare the clearance of metal complexes coupled to the γ- or α-carboxylate of folates or to both the α- and γ-carboxylates of folates (hereinafter sometimes termed bis derivatives) from KB and JAR cells. We obtained the surprising finding that the clearance rate of the a isomer and of the bis isomer from KB and JAR cells is significantly faster than that of the corresponding γ isomer or of .sup.3 H folate.</p><p>Based on this surprising discovery we have also found that the clearance rate of folate-based diagnostic agents designed for use in nuclear medicine or MRI applications can be varied or tailor-made by using various proportions of the α-isomer, the bis isomer and γ-isomer of such diagnostic agents. In addition to tailor-making the rate of clearance from certain organs, such as the kidney, liver, brain, liver, kidneys and from various tissues such as tumors that over-express folate binding protein, the use of chelating agents chosen for the compounds of the present invention provides a greater margin of safety against the toxicity of the metal used in the chelates.</p><p>Experiments from our laboratories on the cellular uptake of monomeric folate conjugates of Gd chelates designed for use in MR applications indicate that structural modifications that bring about an increase the intensity of the MR signal are advantageous, as the signal intensity obtainable with this technique is determined by the quantity of paramagnetic or superparamagnetic metal that can be localized in the target tissues. This is, in turn, limited by the quantity of folate binding protein present in those tissues. The desired increase in signal intensity could be achieved by attaching multimeric Gd chelates to a single folate residue and/or by the use of enhanced relaxivity Gd chelates, that are, as a result of their structure, expected to provide higher intrinsic signal intensity per Gd atom. Based on these observations the following concepts are presented for the design of new monomeric and multimeric folate conjugates of Gd chelates in order to enable MR imaging of tumors and other tissues that over-express the folate binding protein.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In accordance with the present invention, diagnostic and therapeutic compositions, methods for use, and processes for their preparations are provided.

For such applications, gadolinium is the preferred metal.</p><p>Novel dendrimeric structures that contain multiple metal chelating groups can be envisioned that are especially useful for therapeutic or radiotherapeutic applications where it is useful to deliver a large quantity of the chelated metal or therapeutic drug that is used for visualization or therapy or radiotherapy into the targeted tissue. For example, compounds which have the general structure depicted by formula VII, ##STR10## wherein R.sub.0 is a folate-receptor binding residue of formula: ##STR11## dendrimeric structures could be prepared such that W.sub.1 or W.sub.2 contains multiple metal chelating groups. For example, if either W.sub.1 or W.sub.2 or both contained a radical of formula VIIIc: ##STR12## wherein K.sub.1 is a metal chelating ligand radical and M.sub.1 is a metal ion, the resulting dendrimeric complex could be used to deliver high concentrations of gadolinium metal to cells that express high levels of folate binding protein, for use in magnetic resonance imaging applications or for subsequent neutron capture therapy. Similarly, if derivatized with metal chelates that bind radiotherapeutic metal isotopes, such compounds could be used to deliver high concentrations of alpha- or beta-emitting radionuclides for radiotherapy applications.</p><p>Several specific variations of these structures and others are described further below, wherein the nature of the metal-chelating groups, metals and linking groups are selected to fine-tune the properties of the compound to its intended use.</p><p>2. Detailed description of the macrocyclic polyaza ligands and their folate conjugation.</p><p>The polyaza macrocyclic compounds described below can be used for the visualization, therapy or radiotherapy of tissues or organs that overexpress folate-binding protein, depending upon what metal is used. If the compounds are derivatized with a paramagnetic metal such as gadolinium (Gd), they may be used as contrast agents for MRI techniques, after selective uptake of these compounds in tissues that overexpress folate binding protein.</p><p>Experiments from our laboratories on the cellular uptake of monomeric folate conjugates of Gd chelates using KB cells (a cell line that overexpresses FBP) indicated that obtaining adequate signal intensity in Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiments with these targeted imaging agents was very challenging, and that it was an advantage to make modifications that caused a significant increase in signal intensity. This desired increase in signal intensity could be achieved by a) attaching multiple Gd chelates to a single folate residue and/or by b) the use of enhanced relaxivity Gd chelates, which are expected to provide higher intrinsic signal intensity per Gd atom. The use of more than one folate residue per molecule also appears to be propitious based on the work of E. C. Wiener et al., Investigative Radiology, 1997, 32, 748-7544, who estimated that greater than ˜10 gadolinium atoms per folate would be required for successful contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p>Based on these observations, the following concepts are presented for the design of new monomeric and multimeric folate conjugates of Gd chelates in order to enable MR imaging of tumors that over-express the folate binding protein. Said chelates can also be used in radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic techniques, if a suitable radioactive metal is substituted for gadolinium.</p><p>A) General structures for monomeric and multimeric polyaza-macrocyclic ligands conjugated to folate moieties</p><p>The structures disclosed are further modifications of ligand motifs that have been demonstrated to possess enhanced relaxivity as discussed in our co-pending applications WO 95/31444 (Nov. 23, 1995), 08/010,909 (Jan. 29, 1993), U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,752, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,358,704. The aim of making the modifications is to enable conjugation of such enhanced relaxivity ligands to targeting vectors such as folate receptor binding compounds. The relaxivity of a paramagnetic compound is a measure of its signal enhancing effect when used as a contrast agent for MRI. Enhanced relaxivity compounds provide a stronger signal enhancing effect per molecule than can be obtained with the typical relaxation agents that are used for contrast enhancement. We have found that certain macrocyclic metal-chelating ligand motifs, when chelated to paramagnetic metals such as gadolinium, provide an unexpectedly strong signal-enhancing effect. If such enhanced relaxivity chelates are incorporated into a compound that targets a particular tissue such as the folate receptor, localization at the target results in a higher signal intensity than can be obtained if the comparable compound were derivatized with normal chelates for Gd, such as DTPA.</p><p>The amine-thiocarboxylate and carboxylate-containing macrocycles depicted by formula VIa below are conjugatable enhanced relaxivity motifs that can be used for coupling to targeting vectors such as folate. These intermediates are an integral part of this invention, and can be used to prepare conjugates that contain one, or preferably greater than one metal chelate per folate residue. Such multimeric compounds are particularly useful, as multiple paramagnetic metals are localized at the target tissue upon binding of a single folate receptor binding moiety. The presence of multiple paramagnetic metal chelates per molecule, coupled with the enhanced relaxivity properties provided by each of these metal chelates, should significantly improve the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging agents designed for the detection of folate-receptor positive tissue.</p><p>i) Intermediate ligands bearing free carboxylate, thiocarboxylate or amino functions for conjugation to folate moieties</p><p>The conjugatable polyaza macrocyclic ligands are depicted by formula VIa.

Alternatively, 15b could be made from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane by tris-alkylation with t-butyl 2-triflyloxy-D-lactate following the methodology of S. I. Kang et al. (loc cit). t-Butyl 2-triflyloxy-D-lactate is readily obtained from commercially available t-butyl (D)-lactate by triflylation with triflic anhydride.</p><p>The preparation of the conjugatable ligand 17a has been achieved by the alkylation of 15a with methyl 3-azido-2-triflyloxy-propionate (16b) followed by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Similar alkylation of 15b with 16b is expected to afford the conjugatable ligand 15b bearing the amino function. ##STR34## The azido-triflate 16b was prepared as shown in Scheme 5. Isoserine (18) was esterified by treatment with MeOH in the presence of concentrated HCl to obtain 19.

Alper et al. in Tetrahedron Letters 1996, 37, 6029-6032, followed by triflylation by treatment with triflic anhydride and 2,6-lutidine gave the azido-triflate 16b.</p><p>The DO1MA analog 21a or DOTMA analog 21b bearing a conjugatable carboxyl function could be prepared starting from 15a or 15b, respectively, as shown in Scheme 6. For example, alkylation of 15b by the mixed diester, t-butyl benzyl 2-triflyloxy-malate 20, followed by debenzylation, employing catalytic hydrogenolysis, is expected to afford the enhanced relaxivity DOTMA analog 21b bearing the carboxyl function. ##STR35## The triflyloxy mixed ester 20 could be readily made as shown in Scheme 7. t-Butyl malate 23 is made from malic acid (22) following the procedure described by N. Balcheva et al. in Eur. Polym. J., 1991, 27, 479-482. Selective benzylation of 23 by treatment with benzyl chloride and triethylamine, following the procedure described in S. I. Kang et al., Inorg. Chem., 1993, 32, 2912-2918 in the case of lactic acid, followed by triflylation with triflic anhydride and 2,6-lutidine is expected to furnish the synthon 20. ##STR36##</p><p>The carboxyl group bearing enhanced relaxivity DOTMA analog 21a or 21b could be readily converted into an amino group bearing ligands 24a or 24b, respectively, by first coupling 21a or 21b with a mono-protected ethylenediamine derivative such as ZNHCH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 NH.sub.2 using HATU and diisopropylethylamine and then removing the Z group by catalytic hydrogenolysis in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. ##STR37##</p><p>Conjugatable MPDO3A analogs 27a and 27b containing the carboxyl group are also accessible by methods shown in Scheme 8. ##STR38##</p><p>Alkylation of compound 15a by the triflate 25 is expected to provide the orthogonally protected ligand 26a. Debenzylation of 26a by catalytic hydrogenolysis will provide the carboxyl group containing enhanced relaxivity MPDO3A ligand 27a. Similar alkylation of 15b by the triflate 25 is expected to afford the MPDO3A analog 27b via the benzyl ester 26b. ##STR39##</p><p>The alkylating agent 25 that is necessary for the above transformations could be prepared as shown in Scheme 9. Benzyl 4-Hydroxybutyrate (28) is prepared from 4-hydroxybutyric acid by selective benzylation with benzyl bromide as described in S. I. Kang et al., Inorg. Chem., 1993, 32, 2912-2918 in the case of lactic acid.</p><p>Oxidation of 28 by treatment with pyridinium chlorochromate will afford the aldehyde 29. Successive treatment of 29, first with triethylphosphite and then with triflic anhydride in the presence of a hindered base such as diisopropylethyl amine at low temperature is expected to furnish the trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy derivative 25.</p><p>The carboxyl group bearing enhanced relaxivity MPDO3A analogs 27a and 27b could be converted into amino group bearing ligands 30a and 30b, respectively, by first coupling 27a or 27b with a mono-protected ethylenediamine derivative such as ZNHCH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 NH.sub.2 using HATU and diisopropylethyl amine, followed by catalytic hydrogenolysis in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. ##STR40## ii) Preparation of monomeric folate conjugates with enhanced relaxivity polyaza macrocyclic ligands</p><p>The α-folate conjugate 35a of the amino group-bearing enhanced relaxivity ligand 17b could be prepared as shown in Scheme 10. Coupling ligand 17b with the γ protected glutamate derivative ZNH--E(OtBU)--OH (7) using HATU and diisopropylethylamine in a solvent such as dimethylformamide is expected to furnish the product 31. ##STR41##</p><p>Removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl group of 31 and further coupling with N-trifluoroacetyl-pteroic acid (4) employing DCC and HOBT, followed by sequential deprotection with piperidine, aqueous base, and finally ethanolic HCl, is expected to provide the desired folate conjugate 35a. ##STR42##</p><p>The corresponding γ folate conjugate 35b can be prepared by a similar approach starting from the a protected glutamate derivative ZNH--E--(OtBu) (1). The α, γ-bis-conjugate 36 could also be made by coupling folic acid directly with two equivalents of the ligand 17b as per methods described above for the protected glutamic acid derivatives. Other enhanced relaxivity ligands such as 24 and 30 could be substituted for 7 in the above reactions to obtain the corresponding folate conjugates.</p><p>iii) Preparation of multimeric folate conjugates with enhanced relaxivity polyaza macrocyclic ligands</p><p>As discussed above, preparation of multimeric folate conjugates of Gd chelates could deliver a higher Gd concentration into the target cells, thereby increasing the signal intensity during MR imaging. The synthesis of suitable linkers for the preparation of such compounds will first be presented followed by the conjugation methods to obtain the folate conjugates.</p><p>a. Linker chemistry</p><p>Dendrimeric linkers are well known in literature. For example D. A. Tomalia and J. R. Dewald present examples of star burst dendrimers in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,337. Smart cascade polymers are described by J. K. Young et al., Macromolecules, 1994, 27, 3464-3471. In the present invention the nitro-tris-carboxylate 37 and the tris-BOC protected tetra-amine 38, described by J. K. Young et al. (loc. cit.), are used as starting materials to develop a novel orthogonally protected tris-amino-tris carboxylate derivative 39. ##STR43##</p><p>The preparation of the succinic monoamido tri-carboxylic ester 42 was carried out as shown in Scheme 11.</p><p>Treatment of the nitro-tris-tBu ester 37 with trifluoroacetic acid followed by alkylation with benzyl bromide in pyridine provided the nitro-tris-benzyl ester 40. Reduction of the nitro group with Al/Hg gave the amine 41, which upon treatment with succinic anhydride in pyridine provided the succinic mono-amide 42. ##STR44##</p><p>Coupling of the amine 38 with the carboxylic acid 42 employing carbonyldiimidazole in dimethylformamide, as shown in scheme 12, yielded the orthogonally protected tris amino-tri carboxylate linker molecule 39.</p><p>b. Preparation of multimeric folate conjugates</p><p>The multimeric folate conjugate with enhanced relaxivity ligands, in which one folate moiety will be linked to three enhanced relaxivity ligand moieties, could be made as follows.</p><p>The linking molecule viz., the protected amino tricarboxylic ester 44, that is necessary for this preparation was made as shown in Scheme 13. The nitro-tris-t-butyl ester 37 was reduced to the corresponding amino-tris-t-butyl ester by catalytic hydrogenation using Raney Ni catalyst and then protected as the Z derivative to obtain the tris-t-butyl ester 43. Trifluoroacetic acid deprotection furnished the Z protected mono-amino-tris-carboxylic acid 44. ##STR45##</p><p>Coupling of the tris-acid 44 with the enhanced relaxivity ligand 15b, deprotection of the amino group by catalytic hydrogenolysis, and further coupling with the γ-tBu protected glutamate derivative 7 will give the protected glutamide 45.</p><p>Removal of the Z group in compound 45, further coupling with the pteroic acid derivative 4, and deprotection employing successively piperidine, aqueous base, and finally TFA will afford the desired multimeric folate conjugate 46. The corresponding γ folate analog can be made starting from the a protected glutamate derivative ZNH--E--(OtBu) (1). ##STR46##</p><p>A multimeric folate conjugate with enhanced relativity ligands in which three folate moieties are linked to three ligand moieties could be prepared from the 3:3 linker 39, described above. Compound 39 could be subjected to catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/C to obtain the tris-acid 47. ##STR47##</p> <p>Coupling with three equivalents of ligand 15b, followed by selective deprotection of the BOC groups in the presence of t-Bu esters, as described by F. S. Gibson et al., J. Org. Chem 1994, 59, 3216-3218, will provide the tris amine 48. ##STR48##</p><p>Coupling of the tris-amine 48 with 7, deprotection of the amino group, coupling with three equivalents of the pteroic acid derivative (4), and deprotection, employing successively piperidine, aqueous base, and finally TFA, will afford the desired multimeric folate conjugate 49. The corresponding γ folate analog can be made starting from the --α-- protected glutamate derivative ZNH--E--(OtBu) (1). ##STR49## iv) Alternate molecular designs for folate conjugated polyaza macrocyclic ligands</p><p>The methods provided for the monomeric and multimeric folate conjugates of enhanced relaxivity ligands are by way of examples only. It is understood that other multimers of different ratios of folate to the ligand and of higher generations could be made by the methods described that are well known to those skilled in the art and they all will fall within the scope of the present invention. These new conjugates are intended for the MRI imaging of tumors that over-express the folate binding protein.</p><p>To increase the [Gd] at the folate site in vivo it is also possible to visualize multimers other than those based on the dendrimeric linkers presented above. For example the Gd chelate can be incorporated into naturally occurring or unnatural amino acids carrying linkable functionalities such as carboxy or amino groups. These chelate bearing amino acids can be converted into peptides by methods well known to those familiar with peptide synthesis. The fenestrae of the capillaries will allow a size of up to about decameric Gd chelate polymers as linear polymers and about the same size as cyclic or globular polymers.</p><p>Specifically Gd chelates containing the amino acid building blocks as free amino acids attached to, for example, Gd(R-DO3A) where R contains a Gd-binding oxygen atom capable of forming a five membered chelate ring with one nitrogen of the DO3A macrocycle, and a free amino acid, can be synthesized into multimers of from 5 to 20 units, with about 10 units being preferred, using an automated amino acid synthesizer such as an Advanced Chemtech 57. The terminal amino acid may be conjugated to the folate in the ways presented elsewhere herein. For cyclic peptides a lysine is inserted (unconjugated with Gd chelate, and the gamma amino group of the lysine can contain the folate targeting vector. Such bifunctional peptides are also part of this invention.</p> <p>3. Detailed description of the Oxa-PnAO ligands and their folate conjugates</p> <p>For imaging of tissues that overexpress folate binding protein using nuclear medicine techniques, ligands that can chelate 99m-technetium are preferred, as this radioisotope has imaging characteristics that are optimal for detection by commercially available gamma cameras. Experiments from our laboratories on the cellular uptake of folate conjugates of technetium (Tc) chelates using KB cells indicate that, surprisingly, localization of such conjugates in tumors that overexpress folate binding protein is feasible using either the α- or γ-isomer of oxa-PnAO folate. Radioimaging studies with these compounds in folate-deprived tumor-bearing mice showed good localization of the alpha derivative in tumor and kidneys, with negligible uptake by liver. Detailed description of these chelates and methods for their synthesis are now described.</p> <p>A. General structures for oxa-PnAO ligand intermediates for conjugation conjugated folate moieties</p><p>The structures disclosed are further modifications of ligand motifs that were described by Ramalingam et al. in U.S. Pat.

The amine 50 was made as described by Ramalingam et al. (loc. cit.). Alkylation of 50 by the chloro compound 51 in the presence of diisopropylethyl amine in dimethylformamide gave the phthalimido derivative 52a. Deprotection with hydrazine in dichloromethane afforded the conjugatable amino group-bearing oxa-PnAO ligand 52b. ##STR56##</p><p>The alkylating agent 51 was prepared as shown in scheme 15.

The diamine 54 has been described by Ramalingam et al. (loc. cit.). Bis-alkylation of 54 by the chloro derivative 51 is expected to afford the bis-phthalimido derivative 55.

Coupling ligand 52b with the γ-protected glutamate derivative fMOC--NH--E(OtBu)--OH (57) using DCC/HOBT in dimethylformamide provided the glutamate derivative 58. Deprotection with piperidine in acetonitrile gave the amine 59. ##STR59##</p><p>Coupling of 59 with the pteroic acid derivative 4 using HOBT/DCC resulted in the protected conjugate 60.

Further deprotection furnished the desired folate conjugate ligand 68. ##STR62## iii) Preparation of multimeric folate conjugates with the oxa-PnAO ligands</p><p>Conjugates in which more than one folate residue is attached to the oxa-PnAO ligand could be useful since multiple sites of recognition could provide for stronger binding and higher internalization into cells that overexpress the folate receptor. Such ligands could be prepared from the oxa-PnAO ligand that bears two amino groups as in formula 56. Treatment of ligand 56 with the pteroic acid derivative 4 in the presence of DCC/HOBT, followed by successive deprotections, first with piperidine and then with trifluoroacetic acid is expected to furnish the bis α-folate conjugated oxa-PnAO ligand 69. The synthesis of the corresponding bis γ-folate- or mixed bis α-,γ-folate-conjugated oxa-PnAO analogs could be accomplished by similar methods that will be clear to those skilled in the art. ##STR63##</p><p>The methods provided for the folate conjugates of the oxa-PnAO ligands are intended for preparation of compounds for use in nuclear medicine and radiotherapy applications and are based on the general oxa-PnAO ligand class described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,110. In these ligands the folate side chain has been attached at the oxime carbon (C═NOH) furthest from the oxa moiety. However, analogs wherein the folate- or methotrexate-bearing side chain is attached at both oxime carbon atoms, as for example in formula 69, are also included in the present invention. Similar molecules wherein the CH.sub.2 --O--NH functionality is replaced by CH.sub.2 --NR--NH (aza-PnAOs) are included in the present invention. The latter ligand core is covered by U.S. Pat.

Detailed Description of the methods for metal complexation.</p><p>In preparing the compositions of the present invention, the folate receptor-binding moiety is coupled to a metal-chelating ligand moiety, which is complexed with the metal to form a metal chelate. Alternatively, in MRI applications, the ligand may be complexed with a metal, and subsequently conjugated with the folate receptor-binding moiety. The ligands disclosed in (A), (B) and (C) above are complexed with an appropriate metal for the imaging or therapeutic method envisioned. This may be accomplished by methodology known in the art. For example the metal can be added to water in the form of an oxide or in the form of a halide or acetate and treated with an equimolar amount of the ligand molecule. The ligand molecule can be added as an aqueous solution or suspension. Dilute acid or base can be added (where appropriate) to maintain a suitable pH. Heating at temperatures as high as 100 of up to 24 hours or more may sometimes be employed to facilitate complexation, depending on the metal and the chelator, and their concentrations.</p><p>In the examples below, metal chelate synthesis will be illustrated by gadolinlum (Gd) and technetium (Tc) complex synthesis. However, it is to be understood that analogous processes can be used to prepare other metal chelate complexes.</p><p>More particularly, the method of forming the metal complexes derivatized with folate according to the present invention comprises the following steps.</p><p>A metal complex or salt in the desired oxidation state and containing an easily displaceable ligand or ligands (i.e., labile ligands such as H.sub.2 O, Cl, NO.sub.3, or acetate) is mixed with the ligand of the present invention at a pH value suitable for forming the desired complex. The labile ligand is displaced from the metal by the ligands of the present invention to form the metal complexes of the present invention. Illustrative of such methods are the following:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->MX.sub.3 +LH.sub.3 →ML+3 HX                         (1)</pre></p><p>wherein</p><p>X is Cl, Br, F, NO.sub.3 ; or acetate; and</p><p>M is metal such as Gd or Indium in the desired oxidation state;</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->MOCl.sub.4 +LH.sub.2 →MOL+2HCl+2Cl                  (2a)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->MO.sub.2 (R.sub.4).sup.(-/0/+) +LH.sub.2 →MO.sub.2 L+4R.sup.- +2H.sup.+                                                 (2b)</pre></p><p>wherein</p><p>R is a monodentate ligand, such as pyridine, halogen, phosphine or amine; and</p><p>M is a metal such as an isotope of technetium or rhenium;</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->MR.sub.2 +LH.sub.2 →ML+2RH+2H.sup.+                 (3a)</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->MOR.sub.2 +LH.sub.2 →MOL+2RH+2H.sup.+               (3b)</pre></p><p>wherein</p><p>R is a bidentate ligand, such as a sugar, a diol, bis amine or bipyridine; and</p><p>M is a metal.</p><p>Alternatively, for radiopharmaceutical and radiotherapy applications the metal complexes of the present invention can be prepared from a metal in an oxidation state different from that of the desired complex. In this case, either a reducing agent or an oxidizing agent, (depending on the oxidation state of the metal used and the oxidation state of the desired final product) must be added to the reaction mixture to bring the metal to the desired oxidation state. The oxidant or reductant can be used to form an intermediate complex in the desired oxidation state but with labile ligands. These labile ligands can then be displaced by the desired chelating ligand of the present invention. Alternatively, the labile ligands can be added to the reaction mixture along with the reductant or oxidant and the desired ligand to achieve the change to the desired oxidation state and chelation to the desired metal in a single step.</p><p>Also in accordance with the present invention, a method for diagnostic examination or therapeutic treatment of a mammal is provided. This method is based on the mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis activity and involves i) the movement of a folate receptor binding moiety, conjugated through its alpha or gamma carboxylate to a chelated radioactive or non-radioactive metal that can be detected by external imaging techniques, or ii) the movement of a folate receptor binding moiety conjugated through its alpha carboxylate to a chemotherapy agent, into the interior of a cell through invagination of the cell membrane. The folate receptor binding moiety serves to deliver the chelated metal or a chemotherapy agent into cells that overexpress folate binding protein, thereby enabling diagnostic examination, radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic treatment of an organ or tissue comprising the cells.</p><p>In one aspect the method of the present invention comprises the steps of (a) administering to a mammal a composition comprising a paramagnetic or superparamagnetic metal complexed with a chelating ligand and coupled to a folic acid analog contained in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and (b) monitoring the biodistribution of the metal.</p><p>In another aspect the method of the present invention comprises the steps of administering to a mammal a composition comprising a radioactive metal complexed with a chelating ligand coupled to a folic acid analog contained in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for radiotherapeutic treatment of said mammal and monitoring said treatment.</p><p>In still another aspect the method of the present invention comprises the steps of administering to a mammal a composition comprising a chemotherapeutic agent, with or without the presence of a radioactive metal, complexed to a folic acid analog contained in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for chemotherapy treatment of said mammal and monitoring said treatment.</p><p>In the compositions of the present invention a folic acid analog, carrying the metal-chelate complex or the chemotherapeutic agent, binds to folate binding protein on cell membranes, followed by internalization.</p><p>a) Paramagnetic Metals</p><p>Paramagnetic metals are used in affecting the relaxation times of nuclei in mammalian tissue. Certain atomic nuclei, in particular, protons, orient themselves as a result of a strong magnetic field that is applied to them in MR imaging. The pulses of a given radio frequency, or resonance frequency, move the atomic nuclei out of a state of equilibrium. The nuclei then return to their original state of equilibrium as a result of spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation. The time required for returning to the state of equilibrium, known as relaxation time, gives valuable information on the degree of organization of the atoms and on their interaction with their environment.</p><p>On the basis of differences in proton density and relaxation times, images of biological tissues can be obtained which may be used for diagnostic purposes. The greater the differences in the relaxation times of the nuclei which are present in the tissues being examined, the greater will be the contrast in the image that it obtained.</p><p>It is known that the relaxation times of neighboring nuclei can be affected by the use of paramagnetic salts. In solution, the paramagnetic salts are toxic in mammals. Hence, to reduce the toxic effect of paramagnetic metal ions administered for diagnostic purposes, they are combined with complex compounds, i.e. complexing agents. Constituting a part of the present invention, the paramagnetic metals are complexed with ligand moieties prior to, or subsequent to, complexation with folates. The folate complexed with metal chelates increases the concentration of the metal that contains high levels of FBP in cells, thus providing increased contrast of the tissue comprising the cells.</p><p>The paramagnetic metals used in the composition for MR imaging include the elements having atomic numbers of 22 to 29, 42, 44 and 58-70. Examples of such metals are chromium (III), manganese (II), iron (II), iron (III), cobalt (II), nickel (II), copper (II), praseodymium (III), neodymium (III), samarium (III), gadolinium (III), terbium, (III), dysprosium (III), holmium (III), erbium (III) and ytterbium (III). Chromium (III), manganese (II), iron (III) and gadolinium (III) are particularly preferred.</p><p>Doses for administration of paramagnetic metals in the complex of the present invention are from about 0.05 to about 0.3 mmol/kg of body weight.</p><p>The metal complexes of the present invention find utility as diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents. Thus, the present invention provides methods for the diagnosis of the presence and/or status of a disease state, or for the treatment of a disease state, comprising the step of administering a metal complex of the present invention to a subject in need thereof. The metal complexes of the present invention may be administered by an appropriate route such as orally, parentally (for example, intravenously), intramuscularly or intraperitoneally or by any other suitable method. For example, the complexes of this invention may be administered to a subject by bolus or slow infusion intravenous injection.</p><p>b) Radioactive Metals</p><p>In the embodiment of the present invention directed to radiographic imaging or radiotherapy, radioisotopes are utilized.

The choice of metal ion will be determined based on the desired therapeutic or diagnostic application.</p><p>The amount of radiopharmaceutical administered may be selected based on the desired use, such as to produce a diagnostic image of an organ, by methods known in the art. Doses may range from about 2 to 200 mCi, or as limited by the in vivo dosimetry provided by the radiopharmaceuticals. The radiopharmaceutical may optionally be co-administered with a metal-free ligand of the folic acid derivatives of the present invention which derivative is present in an amount of from about 0.05 mg to about 200 mg per dose.</p><p>6. General description of the conjugation of folates with chemotherapeutic agents</p><p>In this embodiment the present invention comprises a chemotherapeutic compound complexed with a folate receptor-binding ligand through its alpha carboxylate or its alpha and gamma carboxylate functionality, which on administration to a patient, is capable of selectively enhancing the transport of the chemotherapeutic agent across the membrane of cancer cells that overexpress FBP and decreasing the uptake to non-target organs, thereby facilitating treatment of the tumor being targeted.</p><p>Chemotherapeutic agents useful in neoplastic disease are listed, for example, in Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 6.sup.th Ed., 1980, MacMillan Publ.

Description of Kits for Forming Metal Complexes</p><p>For radiopharmaceutical or radiotherapy applications it is convenient to prepare the complexes of the present invention at, or near, the site where they are to be used. A single, or multi-vial kit that contains all of the components needed to prepare the complexes of this invention, other than the radionuclide ion itself, is an integral part of this invention.</p><p>The amount administered may be selected based on the desired use, such as to produce a diagnostic image of an organ or other site of a subject or a desired radiotherapeutic effect, by methods known in the art. Exemplary dosages are those employing about 2-200 mCi rhenium (for radiotherapy) or about 10-60 mCi technetium (for imaging). The "subject" of the methods of the present invention is preferably a mammal such as a domestic mammal, for example, a dog, cat, horse or the like, or most preferably, a human. Depending upon the metal and ligand used, the complexes of the present invention may be employed as, for example, imaging agents useful for imaging tissues or organs that overexpress folate binding protein, such as tumor cells, epithelial cells, kidneys, gastrointestinal or the hepatobiliary system.</p><p>Preferred complexes of the present invention are those comprising a ligand complexed with a radionuclide such as technetium, or rhenium.</p><p>Rhenium is particularly useful as a radiotherapy agent. The rhenium employed is preferably one of the radionuclides Re-186 or Re-188, or a mixture thereof, which mixture may also include Re-185 and/or Re-187. Preparation of the complexes of the present invention where the metal is rhenium may be accomplished using rhenium in the +5 or +7 oxidation state. Examples of compounds in which rhenium is in the Re(VII) state are NH.sub.4 ReO.sub.4 or KReO.sub.4. Re(V) is available as, for example, [ReOCl.sub.4 ] (NBu.sub.4), [ReOCl.sub.4 ] (AsPh.sub.4), ReOCl.sub.3 (PPh.sub.3) and as ReO.sub.2 (pyridine).sub.4 +. (Ph is phenyl; Bu is n-butyl). Other rhenium reagents capable of forming a rhenium complex may also be used.</p><p>Technetium is particularly useful as a diagnostic imaging agent. The technetium employed is preferably one or more of the radionuclides Tc-99m, Tc-94m or Tc-96. The preferred radioisotope for medical imaging is .sup.99m Tc. Its 140 keV γ-photon is ideal for use with widely-available gamma cameras. It has short (6 hour) half like, which is desirable when considering patient dosimetry. .sup.99m Tc is readily available at relatively low cost through commercially-produced .sup.99 Mo/.sup.99m Tc generator systems. Preparation of the complexes of this invention where the metal is technetium may be accomplished using technetium in the form of the pertechnetate ion. For Tc-99m, the pertechnetate ion is preferably obtained from commercially available technetium-99m parent-daughter generators; such as technetium is in the +7 oxidation state. The generation of the pertechnetate ion using this type of generator is well known in the art, and is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,369,121 and 3,920,995. These generators may generally be eluted with saline solution, and the pertechnetate ion obtained as the sodium salt. Pertechnetate may also be prepared from cyclotron-produced radioactive technetium using procedures well know in the art.</p><p>A preferred single-vial kit of the present invention comprises a ligand described in sections A, B or C, a folic acid derivative of the α-, γ- and bis isomers in a desired ratio, and a source of a pharmaceutically acceptable reducing agent such as a stannous salt. More preferably, in addition, the kit is buffered with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base to adjust the pH to a desired value for complex formation. It is preferred that the kit contents be in lyophilized form. Such a single vial kit may optionally contain exchange ligands such as glucoheptonate, gluconate, mannitol, malate, citric or tartaric acid and may also contain reaction modifiers, such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. Additional additives, such as solubilizers (for example α-, β- or γ-cyclodextrin), antioxidants (for example ascorbic acid) and/or fillers (for example, NaCi) may be employed to improve the radiochemical purity and stability of the final product, or to aid in the production of the kit.</p><p>A preferred multi-vial kit of the present invention comprises, in one vial, the components, other than the radionuclide itself, required to form a labile radionuclide (especially Tc(V)) complex, that is, an exchange ligand and a pharmaceutically acceptable reducing agent such as a stannous salt. The quantity and type of exchange ligand, and amount and type of reducing agent and buffer used may be selected based on the nature of the exchange complex to be formed. The ligand described in A, B, C, D, or E, a folic acid derivative of the α, γ and bis isomers in a desired ratio of the present invention is contained in a second vial, as well as optional additives such as buffers appropriate to adjust the pH to its optimal value.</p><p>A single vial kit may be ready for use following addition of the radionuclide ion, such as pertechnetate. A multi-vial kit may be ready for use by addition of the radionuclide ion, such as pertechnetate, to the vial containing exchange ligand and reducing agent, and after waiting an appropriate period of time for formation of a labile complex, the contents of this vial are added to the second vial containing a source of the desired ligand. After a reaction time of about 1 to 60 minutes, the complex of the present invention is formed. It is advantageous that the contents of both vials of this multi-vial kit be lyophilized. As described for the single vial kit, additional additives may be employed to improve the radiochemical purity and stability of the final product, or to aid in the production of the kit.</p><p>Alternatively, the multi-vial kit may comprise the desired ligand in one vial and a source of reducing agent such as stannous ion in a second vial. Pertechnetate may be added to the vial containing ligand, and then the contents of the second vial added to initiate labeling. As above, the quantity and type of ligand, buffer pH and reducing agent may be selected based on the nature of the desired ligand use. Again, it is advantageous that the contents of both vials be lyophilized.</p><p>8. Examples</p><p>A.

Both cell lines are reported to overexpress transcripts encoding folate binding protein. KB cells were grown in folate-free Minimal Essential Medium with Earle's salts, 1-glutamine and non-essential amino acids obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. JAR cells were grown in RPMI formulated without folic acid, (catalog #27016, Life Technologies, Inc). The media for each cell line was supplemented with 10% defined fetal calf serum (HyClone, Inc.) Monolayers were cultured at 37 CO.sub.2.</p><p>Forty-eight hours prior to each experiment, 5 seeded into 35 mm culture dishes and allowed to grow for 2 days in folate-depleted media.

Control experiments were performed using 10 pmol of .sup.3 H folate (Amersham International) and 0-900 pmol of cold native folate. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 with ice cold TBS and suspended in one ml of water. Cell associated radioactivity was determined by gamma (G.sup.53 Gd-folate) or scintillation counting (.sup.3 H-folate) of a 500 μl aliquot of this suspension; 100 μl was used in the BCA protein assay (Pierce catalog #23225), which was used to determine and normalize for cellular protein content.</p><p>Data from these studies in KB cells are shown in FIG. 1. In KB cells, the data demonstrate that .sup.3 H folate and the complexes of this invention were equally effective in their ability to compete with cold native folate for binding to KB cells that overexpress folate binding protein. No significant differences were seen in the amount of .sup.3 H-folate or .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)- or (γ)-folate isomers that were bound to the KB cells. These results indicate that covalent attachment of a metal chelate to either the alpha or gamma carboxylate of folic acid does not compromise the ability of the conjugate to bind to KB cells. The results obtained for the alpha isomer are surprising in light of Wang et al., who, as noted above, have taught that alpha conjugates show no ability to compete with native folate.</p><p>In a second experiment, the ability of the alpha and gamma isomers of .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-folate to bind to KB cells at 4 studied.

The cells were then stripped from the plates using 1.0 mL of water. Aliquots of the water/cell mixture were assayed for the respective radioisotopes and for cellular protein (to determine the number of KB cells present in each well). The radioassay data were used to calculate the % of radiolabeled compound bound to the cells in the absence and presence of unlabeled native folate. The results from this study are given in FIG. 2. Data in FIG. 2 are presented as the percentage bound, relative to the % bound in the control wells containing 10 pmol of .sup.3 H-folate.</p><p>These data indicate that when 10 pmol of .sup.153 Gd/Gd(DO3A-APA-folate) was incubated with KB cells for 30 min at 4 γ-isomers of .sup.153 Gd/Gd(DO3A-APA-folate) both bound to the KB cells to the same extent as that observed with 10 pmol of .sup.3 H-folate. (FIG. 2, dark bars).</p><p>These binding experiments were repeated in the presence of 250 pmol of cold native folate, to determine if the addition of excess cold folate would cause a decrease in the quantity of .sup.3 H or .sup.153 Gd bound to the KB cells at the end of the experiment. Such a result is expected if the radiolabeled compounds and native folate compete for binding to folate binding protein on the KB cells and an excess of cold folate is added. The results observed (FIG. 2, white bars) indicate that both native folate and the alpha and gamma isomers of .sup.153 Gd/Gd(DO3A-APA-folate) do compete for folate binding protein on the KB cells, and that the addition of 250 pmol of cold folate causes a similar effect on the degree of binding of 10 pmol .sup.3 H-folate as it does on the binding of 10 pmol of either the alpha or gamma isomer of .sup.153 Gd/Gd(DO3A-APA-folate).</p><p>Data from studies in JAR cells are shown in FIG. 3.</p><p>In these cells, the (α)- or (γ)-isomers of .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-folate were equally effective in their ability to compete with cold native folate for binding to the JAR cells. In contrast to the data from KB cells, binding of these Gd-folate compounds to JAR cells was about half as effective as that of the radiolabeled control (.sup.3 H-folate) under comparable test conditions, as shown in FIG. 1A.</p><p>The finding that the alpha and gamma isomers are equivalent in their ability to compete with native folate for binding to the JAR cells is again surprising, as the results are contrary to the recent patent publication of Low, Green, et al. (WO 96/36367) which teaches away from the alpha isomer being a compound that is taken up by folate uptake mechanism(s) such that it could be used to image the distribution of the same. Even more surprising was the result obtained with the Bis(DO3A-APA)folate compound, which contains a metal chelate moiety at both the alpha and gamma carboxylates of folate; at some folate concentrations, binding of this compound was higher than that observed for the .sup.3 H-folate control.</p><heading>Example 18</heading><heading>In vitro Efflux Studies with.sup.3 H folate, .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)- and -(γ)-folate</heading><p>Efflux studies were performed to examine the washout of Gd-folates or native folate from KB and JAR cells in vitro.

At the end of the 30-min incubation period, the cells were washed five times with ice-cold media lacking folate.</p><p>These folate-loaded cells were then incubated at 37 with folate-depleted media. At predetermined intervals during this time, the incubation medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium at 37 medium was used to determine the rate at which radioactivity from the .sup.3 H-folate, .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(γ)-folate or .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)-folate washed out of the cells.

The data show that when there is no added folate in the media, washout from KB and JAR cells is faster for the alpha derivative than it is for the gamma isomer or native substrate. This finding may be relevant to the in vivo situation where the levels of extracellular folate will drop after the initial bolus.</p><heading>Example 19</heading><heading>In vitro Exchange Studies with .sup.3 H-folate, .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)- and -(γ)-folate</heading><p>Exchange studies were performed to examine the effect of native folate on the radioactivity levels in KB or JAR cells that had been pre-loaded with a saturating level of radiolabeled Gd-folates or native folate in vitro. .sup.3 H-folate, .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(γ)-folate or .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)-folate (250 pmol) was incubated with KB or JAR cells as described in Example 18. At the end of the 30-min incubation period, these .sup.153 Gd-folate or .sup.3 H-folate-loaded cells were washed five times with ice-cold media containing 250 nM cold, native folate and were then incubated at 37 pmol of cold folate. At predetermined intervals during this time, the incubation medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium at 37 C. The radioactivity present in each aliquot of the incubation medium was used to determine the rate at which radioactivity from the .sup.3 H-folate, .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(γ)-folate or .sup.153 GdDO3A-APA-(α)-folate washed out of the cells. At the end of the study, the cells were suspended in one ml of water and assayed for radioactivity and protein content.</p><p>The results of these exchange studies in KB cells are shown in FIG. 4A. KB cells that were loaded with a saturating dose of .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)-folate and subsequently incubated with solutions containing cold native folate lost close to 100% of their radioactivity to the incubation bath within 24 hours, suggesting that the alpha isomer exchanges with the native folate present in the external medium. In contrast, KB cells loaded with .sup.3 H folate or Gd-DO3A-APA-(γ)-folate lost only 20% of the initial radioactivity in the cells to the medium over 24 hours.</p><p>The results of the exchange studies in JAR cells are shown in FIG. 4B. In this cell line, the alpha compound again showed a faster initial net rate of loss of radiolabel to the media than was observed with the gamma and native folate compounds. After 6 hours, 60% of the radioactivity from the cells loaded with the alpha isomer was found in the medium, whereas only 30% of the starting activity had been lost from JAR cells that were loaded with either Gd(DO3A-APA)-folate gamma isomer or .sup.3 H folate. After 24 hours the gamma isomer and native folate also showed significant net loss of activity from the JAR cells to the medium. At 24 hours the amounts of alpha and gamma compound that had washed from the cell were similar.</p><p>These studies demonstrate that the clearance properties of the compound derivatized at the alpha carboxylate of folate are significantly different from those of the gamma analog or underivatized native folate. In vivo, this property may be advantageous as it may serve to reduce the half-life of radioactivity in cells that bind folate analogs, which may improve the dosimetry properties of the agent. For applications in MR imaging this property may be advantageous as it may serve to reduce the biological half-life of the agent in cells that bind folate analogs, which may improve the toxicological profile of the agent.</p><heading>Example 20</heading><heading>Biodistribution Studies in Tumor-bearing Nude Mice at "Tracer" Doses of Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)-folate, Gd-DO3A-APA-(γ)-folate and Bis(Gd-DO3A-APA)-folate</heading><p>To define the ability of the complexes of this invention to target folate-binding protein-expressing tumor cells in vivo, distribution studies were conducted in female athymic (Nu/Nu) mice that were implanted with KB or JAR tumors. The mice were maintained on an ad libitum folate-depleted diet (gamma-irradiated Purina folate-deficient basal diet 5831C-2 with 1% succincyl sulphathiazole) beginning two weeks prior to inoculation. This diet was maintained throughout the duration of the study. The mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the scapular region with 0.1 mL of a tumor cell suspension containing 4 cells. When tumors had grown to 0.2-0.4 cm.sup.3 (2-4 weeks), animals were anesthetized (100 mg ketamine/kg, i.m. and 10 mg xylazine/kg i.p.) and a "trace" dose (0.08 nmol/kg) of either .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)-folate, .sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA-(γ)-folate or Bis(.sup.153 Gd-DO3A-APA)-folate in a volume of 0.2 mL was delivered via tail-vein injection (n=3 animals/compound). Thirty minutes post injection, the mice were sacrificed and selected organs were removed, weighed, and assayed for radioactivity, in order to determine the % injected dose/g-tissue (%ID/g) and the % injected dose/organ (%ID/organ), following procedures known to those skilled in the art. The 30 min tumor and kidney biodistribution results obtained following a tracer (0.08 nmol/kg) dose of Gd-folate are shown in Table I. These data show that the % ID/g in tumor is comparable for all three compounds studied. This result is surprising in light of Low, Green et al, who teach that folates derivatized in the alpha position have little affinity for KB cells in vitro, and by extension, in vivo. The data further show that the %ID/g in kidney is higher for Gd-DO3A-APA-(γ)-folate than it is for the two compounds that are derivatized in the alpha position (Gd-DO3A-APA-(α)-folate and Bis(Gd-DO3A-APA)-folate.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE I______________________________________   Distribution data: KB Mice         Gd-DO3A-  Bis(Gd-DO3A-                              Gd-DO3A-(N = 3/data set @ 30 min)          APA-     APA)-       APA-(0.08 nmol/kg)            (α)-folate                   folate      (γ)-folate______________________________________  % ID/g-tumor          7.7 (1.3)                   5.9 (0.8)   8.9 (2.0)% ID/g kidneys                       47 (6) (2.4)                                          58.4 (8.3)______________________________________</pre></p><p>These results suggest that the radiation dose to kidney that is provided by the two radiolabeled folate compounds that are derivatized in the alpha position will be lower than that provided by the compound that is only derivatized at the gamma carboxylate. Improved kidney dosimetry is attained without adversely affecting tumor radioactivity levels, which are roughly comparable for all three compounds. As radiation background from kidney will interfere with the ability to image folate-receptor positive tissues in adjacent tissues (e.g. ovarian and uterine tumors), substitution at the alpha position may provide a distinct advantage. Implications for the radiation dose provided by alpha-substituted radiotherapeutic folate derivatives to target and non-target tissues are obvious.</p><p>Improved results with alpha-derivatized complexes were also seen in a study that compared the levels of radioactivity found in the kidney and urine following a 0.08 nmol/kg dose of one of the three radiolabeled .sup.153 Gd-folate derivatives.
