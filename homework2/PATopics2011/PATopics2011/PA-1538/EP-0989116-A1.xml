load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p>The present invention provides a liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
composition including a high concentration of methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) which has an improved storage stability.
The invention further provides a method of making the liquid
methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) compositions of the present
invention.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The invention relates to a liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
composition having improved storage stability.</p><p num="0002">Polyisocyanate compositions including a high concentration of
methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) ("MDI"), particularly 4,4'-methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) ("4,4'-MDI"), while useful for various
cellular and non-cellular polyurethane applications often pose a
processing problem in that they are normally a solid at room
temperature, i.e., about 25° C. The material, therefore, has to be
melted and maintained in order to be useful as a liquid.</p><p num="0003">Unfortunately, methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) compositions having
relatively high levels of 4,4'-MDI are also known to have a
limited life due to the formation of diphenylmethane uretdione,
otherwise referred to herein as uretdione. Uretdione tends to
couple with the 4,4'-MDI molecules contained in methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) compositions, thereby forming a substantially
insoluble precipitate over time. For example, 4,4'-MDI
compositions maintained at about 43° C for 14 days have exhibited
uretdione concentrations above the generally acceptable saturation
concentration of 0.5%. The formation of high concentrations
of uretdione have heretofore rendered the methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
compositions substantially useless.</p><p num="0004">Interestingly, the uretdione reaction is both temperature and
phase dependent. For example, as the temperature of a 4,4'-MDI
composition is increased above about 43° C, the rate of uretdione
formation increases. Further, the rate of uretdione formation is
accelerated when the methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) is in the
solid state as compared to a liquid composition at 43°C; such formation
being generally attributed to the alignment of the isocyanate
groups in the crystal lattice structure.</p><p num="0005">In an effort to limit the formation of uretdione, methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) compositions, particularly 4,4'-MDI compositions,
are often frozen and stored at temperatures below
about 0° C. While this temporarily retards the formation of uretdione
dimer, refrigerating the compositions for extended periods
of time prior to use can be expensive and introduces logistic
considerations which must be addressed. </p><p num="0006">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a
liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition which is storage
stable at temperatures above about 30°C.</p><p num="0007">It is a further object of the invention to provide a liquid methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) composition which increases the saturation
concentration of uretdione.</p><p num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide a methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) having a reduced freezing point.</p><p num="0009">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a
liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition which can be
used in the preparation of all types of polyurethanes for which
pure MDI is currently employed.</p><p num="0010">In view of the foregoing, the development of a liquid storage
stable methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition including a
high concentration of 4,4'-MDI that could be shipped in bulk,
thereby reducing the high costs associated with shipping frozen
drummed compositions would be highly desirable.</p><p num="0011">The foregoing objects, among others, are achieved by the methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) compositions of the present invention
comprising a mixture of a) a methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component
including at least about 90.0 weight percent 4,4'-MDI; and
b) an uretonimine. Under preferred embodiments, the uretonimine
will be present in positive amounts of less than about 5.0 weight
percent, based on the weight of the methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
composition. More preferably the uretonimine is present in
amounts ranging from about 0.1 to less than about 5.0 parts per
100.0 parts of methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition, with
amounts ranging from about 0.25 parts to about 2.5 parts being
highly preferred. As will be described in greater detail below, a
catalyst may be employed to cause the formation of uretonimine in
situ. The amount of catalyst will generally range from about
0.0001 to about 5.0 parts, preferably about 0.0002 to about 2.5
parts, per 100.0 of methylene bis(phenylisocyanate).</p><p num="0012">The invention also provides a method of preparing storage stable
liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) compositions by admixing a
methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component including at least
about 90.0 weight percent 4,4' MDI with an uretonimine to form a
liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition which is storage
stable at temperatures as low as about 30°C. </p><p num="0013">Another method of the present invention relates to the in situ
formation of uretonimine in liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
composition including at least about 90.0 weight percent
4,4'-MDI.</p><p num="0014">The methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition of the present
invention comprises a) a methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component
including at least about 90.0 weight percent 4,4'-MDI; and
b) an uretonimine.</p><p num="0015">The methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component a) which includes
at least about 90.0 weight percent 4,4'-MDI, more preferably will
include at least about 95.0 weight percent 4,4'-MDI and under a
highly preferred embodiment will include at least about 98.0
weight percent 4,4'-MDI. Generally, in addition to the 4,4'-MDI,
the component a) may include 2,4'-MDI; 2,2'-MDI and other isomers,
the 2,4'-MDI isomer being the predominant specie therein.
The 2,4'-MDI isomer (and other MDI isomers) may make up the
balance of the component a). Preferably, however, these isomers
are limited to relatively low levels, i.e., about 2% or less by
weight of component a).</p><p num="0016">The amount of methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component a) in the
composition of the present invention may be as low as about 80
weight percent, based on the total weight of the methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) composition. However, compositions of the
present invention preferably comprise at least about 90.0 weight
percent, more preferably at least about 95 weight percent, most
preferably at least about 99 weight percent, of the methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) component.</p><p num="0017">In another aspect of the present invention, the source of uretonimine
to the composition may contribute additional amounts of
methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) isomers (predominantly 4,4'-MDI)
to raise the level of methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component
(and accordingly 4,4'-MDI level) in the composition, as described
below. As such, the amount of methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
component a) in the composition of the present invention may be
at least 97.5 weight percent, based on the total weight of the
methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition, preferably at least
about 98.75 weight percent, or at least about 99.75 weight percent.
As described above, this component a) will predominantly
comprise the 4,4'-MDI isomer, with the remainder of the methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) component (preferably 2% or less) comprising
2,4'-MDI and other isomers. </p><p num="0018">The methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component a) can be produced
by any of the commonly employed processes including the distillation
of crude mixtures of isocyanate obtained by phosgenating a
mixture of polyamines generally obtained by acid condensation of
aniline and formaldehyde.</p><p num="0019">The uretonimine b) may be introduced into the methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
composition as part of an organic isocyanate blend
or may be formed in situ in the methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
component to form the composition of the present invention. The
uretonimine b) is generally formed by initially reacting, for
example, 4,4'-MDI with a suitable catalyst such as a phospholene
oxide with heating to give MDI carbodiimide. The MDI carbodiimide
then reacts with excess 4,4'-MDI to give uretonimine groups as
illustrated by the following reaction:
<img id="img-00040001" orientation="unknown" wi="135" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00040001.tif" inline="no" he="158"/></p><p num="0020">Thus, in the presence of excess 4,4'-MDI, the carbodiimide converts
(but remains in equillibrium with the carbodiimide) to the
uretonimine. This organic isocyanate blend, therefore, comprises
uretonimine and methylene bis(phenylisocyanate), e.g., for
example at ratios of 25:75, respectively. In the composition of
the present invention, the amount of methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
takes into account amounts contributed thereto coming from
the organic isocyanate blend.</p><p num="0021">The uretonimine may be formed as described above from organic
isocyanates including 2,4'-MDI and 2,2'-MDI isomers and mixtures
thereof (particularly those comprising at least about 45 weight
percent 4,4'-MDI), as well as aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic
polyisocyanates and combinations thereof. Represantative
of these types are monoisocyanates including phenyl isocyanates,
cyclohexyl isocyanate; the diisocyanates such as m-phenylene
diisocyanate, 2,4-toluene diisocyanate, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate,
mixtures of 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, hexamethylene
diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,4-diisocyanate,
hexahydrotoluene diisocyanate (and isomers),
isophorone diisocyanate, hydrogenated methylene bis(phenylisocyanate),
naphthalene-1,5 diisocyanate, 1-methoxyphenyl-2,4-diisocyanate,
4,4'-biphenylene diisocyanate,
3,3'-dimethoxy-4,4'-biphenyl diisocyanate, 3,3'-dimethyl-diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate;
the triisocyanate such as
4,4',4''-triphenylmethane triisocyanate and toluene 2,4,6-triisocyanate;
and the tetraisocyanates such as 4,4'-dimethyldiphenylmethane-2,2',5,5'-tetraisocyanate
and polymeric polyisocyanates
such as polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanate, by way of
non-limiting example. The reaction mechanism in each case is well
known to those skilled in the art and are similar to the one
exemplified above for production of the uretonimine from
4,4'-MDI.</p><p num="0022">The amount of uretonimine to be included in the methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) composition of the present invention will
generally range from about 0.1 to about 10.0 parts per 100.0
parts of methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) composition, more preferably,
from about 0.25 parts to about 2.5 parts, and most preferably
from about 0.25 to about 1.25 php of the composition.</p><p num="0023">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a desired
amount of uretonimine is produced in situ in the methylene
bis(phenylisocyanate) composition of the present invention, wherein
a catalyst c) capable of reacting with 4,4'-MDI to give MDI
carbodiimide, at least some of which is then converted to uretonimine
in the presence of excess 4,4'-MDI, as described above. </p><p num="0024">Thus, under certain embodiments, it may be desirable to add a
catalyst c) into the methylene bis(phenylisocyanate) component a)
to produce the storage stable liquid methylene bis(phenylisocyanate)
compositions of the present invention.</p><p num="0025">Illustrative of such catalysts are:
