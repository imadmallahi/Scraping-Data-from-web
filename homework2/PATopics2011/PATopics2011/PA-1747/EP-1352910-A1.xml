is currently a world-wide need for additional pain therapy. The pressing
requirement for a target-oriented treatment of pain conditions which is right
for the patient, which is to be understood as the successful and satisfactory
treatment of pain for the patients, is documented in the large number of
scientific works which have recently and over the years appeared in the
field of applied analgesics or on basic research on nociception.</p><p num="0003">The facilitated, carrier-mediated transport of nucleosides across

mammalian cell membranes can be inhibited by a number
of ligands including nucleoside derivatives such as
nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI, <b>1</b>)<sup>i</sup>, and non-nucleoside
compounds including marketed substances such as
dipyridamole and dilazep.<sup>ii,iii</sup> Such compounds contribute
to the physiological actions of adenosine. Through their blockade of the
transport protein they increase the extracellular concentration of adenosine.
This increase in adenosine levels causes a more profound occupancy of
adenosine receptors through which adenosine exerts many of its
physiological effects. The high hydrophilicity of NBTI and other transport
inhibitors, however, may hinder their penetration into the CNS, where
adenosine is involved in e.g., counteracting neuropathic pain. </p><p num="0004">An earlier study indicated that a nitro group preferably at the 4-position of
the benzyl moiety in NBTI is a prime factor in determining the potency of
inhibition of nucleoside transport in human erythrocytes.<sup>iv,v</sup> To gain further
information on the interaction of NBTI with the nucleoside transporter-associated
binding site we systematically replaced a number of
substituents at C6 and N9. Also the 1-deaza-2-chloro analog of NBTI was
prepared. The prime aim was to provide substances with reduced polarity
while maintaining substantial affinity for the transport protein.</p><p num="0005">Still, the underlying main object of the present invention was to find a
substance useful in the treatment of pain but also other indications as well
as pharmaceutical compositions for this treatment.</p><p num="0006">It has now been found that new derivatives of nitrobenzylthioinosine are
surprisingly useful in the treatment of pain but also other indications.</p><p num="0007">The main object of the invention is therefore a derivative of
nitrobenzylthioinosine according to formula I

group on NBTI to a substituent with a lower hydrophilicity. The
oxadiazole functionality instead of a nitro group in compounds <b>14-16</b>
showed high activity, comparable to NBTI itself. This ring system was then
systematically modified to yield 2,1-isoxazole (compounds <b>23</b> and <b>24),</b> 2,1-isothiazole
(compounds <b>28</b> and <b>31),</b> imidazole <b>(37, 38)</b> and thiazole <b>(41)</b>
derivatives, respectively.</p><p num="0175">Compound <b>23</b> showed reduced activity compared to <b>14</b>. Apparently,
replacement of one N with C as in compound <b>23</b> is not very favorable,
although such manipulation substantially decreases the compound's
hydrophilicity. In a further effort to reduce polarity, S was introduced instead
of O in the isoxazole ring to produce isothiazole <b>28.</b> Also this compound
showed a decline in affinity, with both compounds displaying K<sub>i</sub> values of
approx. 100 nM.</p><p num="0176">Further modification of the oxadiazole functionalities in <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> to
imidazoles (<b>37</b> and <b>38</b>) had a negative effect on affinity. The free NH group
in the imidazole group may have a profound effect on the compound's
basicity. Therefore, thiazole <b>41</b> with S instead of NH was prepared. This
substantially less polar derivative had appreciable affinity for the nucleoside
transport protein (K<sub>i</sub> = 165 nM), although quite comparable to imidazole
derivative <b>37</b>. </p><p num="0177">In the C6-substituted compounds we also studied the effect of the
position of substitution with respect to the -SCH2- bridge between
nucleobase and ring substituent (pairs of compounds <b>14-15, 23-24</b> and <b>37-38).</b>
All <i>'ortho'</i> substituted nucleosides <b>(15, 24</b> and <b>38)</b> showed a reduced
affinity when compared to their counterparts. A similar conclusion was
drawn in another study in which the nitro functionality was shifted from the
para position to other positions in the ring.<sup>iv</sup> Further modification of
compound <b>15</b> by introduction of chlorine in the benzyl ring system did not
improve the binding affinity in <b>16</b>. An analogous approach, bromination of
<b>28</b> to yield <b>31</b>, resulted in a 2.6-fold affinity gain from 108 to 42 nM.</p><p num="0178">Next the effect of N9 substitution was studied. Since the ribose group with
three hydroxyl groups is very hydrophilic, the N9 position was substituted
with different alkyl and modified alkyl groups. Introduction of a hydroxyl
group at C4 in a butyl substituent (<b>47</b>) had a negative effect on the binding
affinity, whereas the protected alcohol showed a higher affinity (<b>46</b>).
Compound <b>48</b> with a cyclopentyl group on N9 showed a decrease in
activity compared to a simple n-butyl substituent (<b>53</b>). Compounds <b>43</b> and
<b>44</b> bearing a tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran N9-substituent,
respectively, were designed as deoxy sugar analogs. They also showed a
decrease in activity compared to compound <b>53</b> with the n-butyl substituent.
From these data an n-butyl at N9 was chosen as a less polar substituent,
although the ribose group itself (as in NBTI) led to much higher affinity. This
became further apparent when synthesizing <b>54</b>-<b>56</b>, since in all cases a
substantial reduction in affinity (16 - 577-fold) was observed when
compared to the ribose-substituted analogs. This huge decrease in affinity
had not been observed when comparing similar series of compounds on
the actual transport in intact erythrocytes. In this typical assay the
compounds need to enter the cells first, which is more easily achieved with
the N9-butyl derivatives. Differences in activity were negligible in this case.<sup>iv</sup></p><p num="0179">Finally in case of substitution of N1 with a carbon atom (1-deazapurines)
the resulting nucleosides show a decrease in affinity (compound <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> 
vs NBTI). Introduction of a nitro group in nucleoside <b>61</b> increased the

<b>[<sup>3</sup>H]NBTI binding assay.</b> Saturation and displacement equilibrium NBTI

adenosine's actions in the CNS. As such their use may be in the treatment
of chronic and/or neuropathic pain, epilepsy and other CNS-related
disorders. Currently available ligands are often very hydrophilic, preventing
substantial passage of the blood-brain barrier. In this study we addressed
this issue by synthesizing and testing derivatives of NBTI with decreased
hydrophilicity by focussing on both C6- and N9-substitution.

Many compounds proved to have affinities in the nanomolar range,
although less active than NBTI itself. The substantial reduction in polarity 
achieved in some of the compounds is promising; they may have more
favorable characteristics in aspects of absorption and distribution </p><heading><b>Literatur:</b></heading><p num="0216"><sl><li>1) Plagemann, P. G. W.; Wohlhueter, R. M.; Woffendin, C. <i>Biochim
