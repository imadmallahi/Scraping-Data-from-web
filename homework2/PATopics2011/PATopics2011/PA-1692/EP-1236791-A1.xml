wherein basic material of the detergent is stabilised by both salicylate and
phenate surfactants. The mass % of the salicylate, as a percentage of the
total surfactant mass, is greater than 50, provided that, when said mass % is
less than 60, the TBN: mass % surfactant ratio of the detergent is 10 or less.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">This invention relates to oil-soluble overbased salicylate-phenate
detergent additives, or concentrates, for lubricating oil compositions, such as
compression-ignited (diesel) marine engine lubricating oil compositions.</p><p num="0002">The term "marine" does not restrict the engines to those used in waterborne
vessels; as is understood in the art, it also includes those for auxiliary
power generation applications and for main propulsion stationary land-based
engines for power-generation.</p><p num="0003">One type of marine diesel engine is a medium-speed four-stroke engine,
frequently referred to as a trunk piston engine. Lubricants (or lubricating oil
compositions) for such engines are known and may be referred to as trunk
piston engine oils or TPEO's.</p><p num="0004">Manufacturers commonly design marine diesel engines to use a variety
of diesel fuels, ranging from good quality light distillate fuel with low sulfur and
asphaltene content to poor quality intermediate or heavy fuel such as "Bunker
C" or residual fuel oil with generally higher sulfur and asphaltene content.
Lubricants used in such engines are often contaminated with asphaltene
components from the fuel. This leads to severe engine cleanliness problems
in service (sometimes referred to as "black paint"), a problem which is
particularly widespread in four-stroke trunk piston engines where dirty cam
boxes, deposits in piston scraper rings and sludge coatings on crankcase
walls are found. Further, the lubricant handling system, for example, the
heaters, filters and centrifuges, may function less well. The problem may not
be confined to four-stroke engines; two-stoke cross-head engines may also
be affected.</p><p num="0005">EP-A-0 662 508 describes a way of overcoming the problem using a
composition that includes, as a detergent, a hydrocarbyl-substituted phenate
concentrate having a TBN greater than 300 and a hydrocarbyl-substituted
salicylate. The data in Example 2 thereof demonstrate that, for a
combination of the two detergents, performance is inferior using more
salicylate than phenate compared with more phenate than salicylate. </p><p num="0006">The present invention surprisingly establishes that, when the salicylate
and phenate are present in the form of a complex, superior results are
achieved when more salicylate than phenate is used. A complex offers the
advantages of superior convenience and handleability.</p><p num="0007">Complex detergents are known: see, for example International
Publication Numbers WO's 97/46643, 97/46644, 97/46645, 97/46646 and
97/46647; and EP-A-0 750 659. But, none of the above specifically describes
high salicylate content salicylate-phenate detergents according to this
invention.</p><p num="0008">In a first aspect, the present invention is an oil-soluble overbased salicylate-phenate
detergent additive comprising a complex wherein basic material of
the detergent is stabilised by both salicylate and phenate surfactants wherein
the mass % of the salicylate, as a percentage of the total surfactant mass, is
greater than 50, provided that, when said mass % is less than 60, the TBN:
mass % surfactant ratio of the detergent is 10 or less.</p><p num="0009">In a second aspect, the present invention is a lubricating oil composition
comprising an admixture of an oil of lubricating viscosity, in a major amount,
and a detergent additive of the first aspect of the invention, in a minor amount.</p><p num="0010">In a third aspect, the present invention is a method of lubricating a trunk
piston marine diesel engine comprising supplying to the engine a lubricating
oil composition of the second aspect of the invention.</p><p num="0011">In a fourth aspect, the invention is a combination comprising
<sl><li>(a) mechanical parts to be lubricated of a trunk piston marine diesel
engine; and</li><li>(b) a lubricating oil composition of the second aspect of the invention</li></sl></p><p num="0012">In the fifth aspect, the invention is the use of a detergent additive of the first
aspect of the invention in a lubricating oil composition to suspend asphaltene 
components in the composition when used in a trunk piston marine diesel
engine.</p><p num="0013">In this specification:
<sl><li>"Major amount" means in excess of 50 mass % of the composition.</li><li>"Minor amount" means less than 50 mass % of the compositions, both in
respect of the stated additive and in respect of the total mass % of all of the
additives present in the composition, reckoned as active ingredient of the
additive or additives.</li><li>"Comprises or comprising" or cognate words are taken to specify the
presence of stated features, steps, integers, or components, but does not
preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps,
integers, components or groups thereof.</li><li>"TBN" is Total Base Number as measured by ASTM D2896.</li><li>"Oil-soluble" or "oil-dispersable" do not necessarily indicate that the
additive(s) are soluble, dissolvable, miscible or capable or being suspended in
oil, in all proportions. They do mean, however, that they are, for example,
soluble or stably dispersably in oil to an extent sufficient to exert their intended
effect in the environment in which the oil is employed. Moreover, the
additional incorporation of other additives may also permit incorporation of
higher levels of a particular additive, if desired.</li></sl></p><p num="0014">All percentages reported are mass % on an active ingredient basis, i.e.,
without regard to carrier or diluent oil, unless otherwise stated.</p><p num="0015">It should be noted that the lubricating oil compositions of this invention
comprise defined individual, i.e, separate, components that may or may not
remain the same chemically before and after mixing.</p><p num="0016">The features of the invention will now be discussed in further detail
as follows:- </p><heading><b><u style="single">OVERBASED DETERGENT</u></b></heading><p num="0017">A detergent is an additive that reduces formation of piston deposits, for
example high-temperature varnish and lacquer deposits, in engines; it has
acid-neutralising properties and is capable of keeping finely divided solids in
suspension. It is based on metal "soaps", that is metal salts of acidic organic
compounds, sometimes referred to as surfactants.</p><p num="0018">A detergent comprises a polar head with a long hydrophobic tail, the
polar head comprises a metal salt of the acid. Large amounts of a metal base
are included by reacting an excess of a metal compound, such as an oxide or
hydroxide, with an acidic gas such as carbon dioxide to give an overbased
detergent which comprises neutralised detergent as the outer layer of a metal
base (e.g. carbonate) micelle. The overbased detergents of this invention
may have a TBN of 200 or greater, or 250 or greater, or 300 or greater, such
as 300 to 500, preferably 300 to 400.</p><p num="0019">As stated, the detergent is in the form of a complex wherein the basic
material is stabilised by silicylate and phenate surfactants. Complexes are
distinguished from mixtures of separate overbased detergents, an example of
such a mixture being one of an overbased salicylate detergent with an
overbased phenate detergent.</p><p num="0020">The present detergents may be made, as generally described in
International Patent Application Publication Nos WO 9746643/4/5/6 and 7
(mentioned above), as hybrid complexes by neutralising a mixture of a
salicylic acid and a phenol with a basic metal compound, and then
overbasing. Individual basic micelles of the detergent are thus stabilised by
salicylate and phenate.</p><p num="0021">They may also be made, as generally described in EP-A-0 750 659 (also
mentioned above), as a calcium salicylate/phenate complex, by carboxylating
a calcium phenate and then sulfurising and overbasing the mixture of calcium
salicylate and calcium phenate. </p><p num="0022">The detergent of the invention may be an alkali or alkaline earth metal,
e.g., sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, and magnesium, detergent.
Calcium is preferred.</p><p num="0023">Surfactants for the surfactant system of the overbased metal detergent
may contain at least one hydrocarbyl group, for example, as a substituent on
an aromatic ring. The term "hydrocarbyl" as used herein means that the
group concerned is primarily composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms and is
bonded to the remainder of the molecule via a carbon atom, but does not
exclude the presence of other atoms or groups in a proportion insufficient to
detract from the substantially hydrocarbon characteristics of the group.
Advantageously, hydrocarbyl groups in surfactants for use in accordance with
the invention are aliphatic groups, preferably alkyl or alkylene groups,
especially alkyl groups, which may be linear or branched. The total number of
carbon atoms in the surfactants should be at least sufficient to impart the
desired oil-solubility.</p><p num="0024">Salicylates of the invention may be non-sulphurized or sulphurized, and
may be chemically modified and/or contain additional substituents, for
example, as discussed below for phenates. Processes similar to those
described below may also be used for sulphurizing a hydrocarbyl-substituted
salicylic acid, and are known to those skilled in the art. Salicylic acids are
typically prepared by the carboxylation, by the Kolbe-Schmitt process, of
phenoxides, and in that case, will generally be obtained (normally in a diluent)
in admixture with uncarboxylated phenol.</p><p num="0025">Preferred substituents in salicylates are those represented by R in the
description of phenols below. In alkyl-substituted salicylicates, the alkyl
groups advantageously contain 5 to 100 carbon atoms, preferably 9 to 30
carbon atoms, especially 14 to 20 carbon atoms.</p><p num="0026">Phenates of the invention may be non-sulphurized or, preferably,
sulphurized. Further, the term includes phenates derived from phenols
containing more than one hydroxyl group (for example, alkyl catechols) or
fused aromatic rings (for example, alkyl naphthols) and phenols which have
been modified by chemical reaction, for example, alkylene-bridged phenols 
and Mannich base-condensed phenols; and saligenin-type phenols
(produced by the reaction of a phenol and an aldehyde under basic
conditions).</p><p num="0027">Preferred phenates are those derived from phenols of the formula
<img id="img-00060001" orientation="unknown" wi="20" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060001.tif" inline="no" he="33"/>
where R represents a hydrocarbyl group and y represents 1 to 4. Where y is
greater than 1, the hydrocarbyl groups may be the same or different.</p><p num="0028">The phenols from which the phenates are derived are frequently in
sulphurized form. Sulphurized hydrocarbyl phenols may typically be
represented by the formula:
<img id="img-00060002" orientation="unknown" wi="85" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060002.tif" inline="no" he="34"/>
where x is generally from 1 to 4. In some cases, more than two phenol
molecules may be linked by S<sub>X</sub> bridges.</p><p num="0029">In the above formulae, hydrocarbyl groups represented by R are
advantageously alkyl groups, which advantageously contain 5 to 100 carbon
atoms, preferably 5 to 40 carbon atoms, especially 9 to 12 carbon atoms, the
average number of carbon atoms in all of the R groups being at least about 9
in order to ensure adequate solubility in oil. Preferred alkyl groups are nonyl
(tripropylene) groups. </p><p num="0030">In the following discussion, hydrocarbyl-substituted phenols will for
convenience be referred to as alkyl phenols.</p><p num="0031">A sulphurizing agent for use in preparing a sulphurized phenol or
phenate may be any compound or element which introduces -(S)<sub>X</sub>- bridging
groups between the alkyl phenol monomer groups, wherein x is generally
from 1 to about 4. Thus, the reaction may be conducted with elemental
sulphur or a halide thereof, for example, sulphur dichloride or, more
preferably, sulphur monochloride. If elemental sulphur is used, the
sulphurization reaction may be effected by heating the alkyl phenol compound
at from 50 to 250°C, and preferably at least 100°C. The use of elemental
sulphur will typically yield a mixture of bridging groups -(S)<sub>X</sub>- as described
above. If a sulphur halide is used, the sulphurization reaction may be effected
by treating the alkyl phenol at from -10°C to 120°C, preferably at least 60°C.
The reaction may be conducted in the presence of a suitable diluent. The
diluent advantageously comprises a substantially inert organic diluent, for
example mineral oil or an alkane. In any event, the reaction is conducted for
a period of time sufficient to effect substantial reaction. It is generally
preferred to employ from 0.1 to 5 moles of the alkyl phenol material per
equivalent of sulphurizing agent.</p><p num="0032">Where elemental sulphur is used as the sulphurizing agent, it may be
desirable to use a basic catalyst, for example, sodium hydroxide or an organic
amine, preferably a heterocyclic amine (e.g., morpholine).</p><p num="0033">Details of sulphurization processes are well known to those skilled in the
art.</p><p num="0034">In one form of the invention, the salicylate-phenate may be non-sulfurised.</p><p num="0035">In the detergents of the invention, the TBN: mass % surfactant ratio is
preferably 10 or less when the mass % of salicylate in the detergent is 60 or
greater. International Publication Number WO 97/46645 describes how the
TBN: mass % surfactant ratio may be measured. </p><p num="0036">It is also preferred that the mass % of the salicylate, as a percentage of
the total surfactant mass, is 65 or greater, preferably 70 or greater, or more
preferably 75 or greater.</p><p num="0037">It is preferred that the salicylate surfactant content of the detergent is
greater than 30, such as greater than 35, mass %, and that the phenate
surfactant content of the detergent is greater than 8, such as 10 or greater,
mass %.</p><p num="0038">Advantageously, the detergents of the invention have a kinematic
viscosity, at 100°C, of less than 1,000 mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.</p><heading><b><u style="single">LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITIONS</u></b></heading><p num="0039">To provide the second aspect of the invention, the overbased detergents
may be incorporated into an oil of lubricating viscosity (or basestock) in any
convenient way. Thus, they may be added directly to the oil by dispersing or
dissolving them in the oil at the desired concentration optimally with the aid of
a suitable solvent such as toluene or cyclohexane, and at ambient or elevated
temperature.</p><p num="0040">Because the detergents of the invention posses both high TBN and high
active matter content, it is possible to blend lubricating oil compositions that
have relatively high TBN and organic carboxylate surfactant concentrations, at
lower detergent treat rates than hitherto.</p><p num="0041">Preferably, the composition is a marine lubricant such as a TPEO.</p><p num="0042">The lubricating oil compositions of this invention have been found to be
particularly efficacious in mitigating aforementioned "black paint" problem.</p><p num="0043">The base stock for the composition may be synthetic or natural.</p><p num="0044">Synthetic base stocks include alkyl esters of dicarboxylic acids,
polyglycols and alcohols; poly-α-olefins, including polybutenes; alkyl
benzenes; organic esters of phosphoric acids; and polysilicone oils. </p><p num="0045">Natural base stocks include mineral lubricating oils which may vary
widely as to their crude source, for example, as to whether they are paraffinic,
napthenic, mixed, or paraffinic-napthenic, as well as to the method used in
their production, for example, their distillation range and where they are
straight run or cracked, hydrofined, or solvent extracted.</p><p num="0046">Lubricating oil base stocks suitable for use in crankcase lubricants
conveniently have a viscosity of 2.5 to 12 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, at 100°C, although base
stocks with other viscosities may also be used, for example, bright stock.</p><p num="0047">Lubricating oil base stocks suitable for use in marine lubricants
conveniently have a viscosity of typically 3 to 15 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, at 100°C, although
base stocks with other viscosities may also be used. Thus, for example,
bright stocks, which typically have a viscosity of 30 to 35 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 100°C may
be used.</p><p num="0048">Additional additives may be incorporated in the composition to enable it
to meet particular requirements. Examples of additional additives which may
be included in lubricating oil compositions containing an overbased detergent
in accordance with the invention are viscosity index improvers, corrosion
inhibitors, oxidation inhibitors or antioxidants, friction modifiers, dispersants,
other detergents, metal rust inhibitors, anti-wear agents, pour point
depressants, and anti-foaming agents. Lubricating oils suitable for use in
marine engines advantageously include a dispersant and an antiwear agent
as additional antioxidants, antifoaming agents and/or rust inhibitors. Certain
of the additional additives specified below are more appropriate for use in
lubricants for automobile engine than for use in lubricants for marine engines.</p><p num="0049">The compositions may typically contain 5 to 40 mass % of additives, the
remainder being base oil. </p><heading><u style="single">Examples</u></heading><p num="0050">The following examples illustrate, but in no way limit, the invention.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 1</u>   <u style="single">Preparation of Overbased Calcium Salicylate- Phenate
Detergent</u></heading><p num="0051">673g toluene, 191g methanol, 33g water, and 19g of diluent oil (SN150) were
introduced into a reactor and mixed while maintaining the temperature at
approximately 20°C. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) (136g) was added, and
the mixture was heated to 40°C, with stirring. To the slurry obtained in this
way was added 521g of alkylsalicylic acid and 134g of sulphurised nonyl
phenol.</p><p num="0052">The temperature of the mixture was reduced to approximately 28°C, and
maintained at this temperature while carbon dioxide (44g) was injected into
the mixture over a period of 90-120 minutes. The temperature was then
raised to 60°C over 60 minutes, following which the mixture was cooled to a
temperature of approximately 28°C over 30 minutes. At 28°C, a further
quantity of calcium hydroxide (88g) was added and then the temperature was
maintained at approximately 28°C while carbon dioxide (44g) was again
injected into the mixture over a period of 90-120 minutes. After this second
carbonation step, the temperature was raised to 60°C over 90 minutes.
During this heat treatment period, when the temperature reached 45°C, a
further charge of diluent oil (41g) was added.</p><p num="0053">To complete the synthesis, the product was heated from 60 to 160°C in four
hours to remove the solvents and water. This solvent stripping process was
