A long lasting fragrance on the dried laundry is one such benefit others include malodour counteractants as illustrated in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5554588A" status="new"><text>US patent 5,554,588</text></patcit>, aromatherapy agents, chemaesthetic agents etc. Unfortunately it is technically difficult to achieve both a high degree of cleaning and delivery of small organic molecules to a surface simultaneously as can be seen from the various means which have been attempted to deliver a long lasting fragrance from a laundry cleaning process, e.g. in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5500154A" status="new"><text>US patent 5,500,154</text></patcit>. Not only are fragrance ingredients susceptible to reaction with other ingredients in the detergents, they can also be solubilised by surfactant and so lost from the wash. Furthermore volatile materials such as fragrances can evaporate as the laundry dries. Whilst it may be beneficial to generate a noticeable fragrance during the laundering process and while drying, the loss of perfume usually means that comparatively little fragrance remains on the dried laundry.</p><p num="p0003">Adding fragrance during later stages of the laundry process is one way to provide fragrance to the laundry e.g. through rinse conditioners or drier sheets as shown in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4511495A" status="new"><text>US patent 4,511,495</text></patcit> and ironing products but this involves the cost and inconvenience of purchasing and using an additional product. Another method for delivering perfume to laundered fabric is one which increases deposition during the wash and prevents evaporation during drying for example by the use of pro-fragrances. These molecules deposit onto textiles during the wash and later react to release volatile fragrance molecules. The reaction can be triggered by a number of means: under the influence of co-deposited enzymes as in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5726345A" status="new"><text>US patent 5,726,345</text></patcit>, of sunlight as in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US6218355B" status="new"><text>US patent 6,218,355</text></patcit>, or by bacterial or enzymatic decomposition. Such<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> technology is successful but is limited to a relatively small range of fragrance materials which can be used to synthesis pro-fragrances and that the resulting odour cannot comprise the mixture of molecules that generally comprise a full fragrance. A more promising approach has been to encapsulate the fragrance. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4145184A" status="new"><text>US patent 4,145,184</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US4234627A" status="new"><text>US patent 4,234,627</text></patcit> teach using a capsule with an outer coating which prevents diffusion of the perfume through the capsule wall. The capsules deposit on the fabrics during laundering and open to release their contents as occurs during fabric manipulation. However there are several practical difficulties to be overcome to make this technology work commercially. One of the major difficulties has been to dose the capsules in such a way that they do not separate within the packet of powder because of particle size differences. Also the capsules must be sufficiently robust to withstand all the processes involved in manufacture e.g. transporting, handling and packing yet still be sufficiently friable as to rupture under relatively gentle conditions whilst handling the garment. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a means of protecting a wide range of perfumery materials during prolonged storage in the detergent. For example certain fragrance components are sensitive to the alkalinity and/or bleach content of detergent powders.</p><p num="p0004">It would be desirable to provide a method for delivering a broad range of perfumery ingredients to laundry from a detergent product during the laundry process.</p><p num="p0005">It would be desirable to provide a long lasting fragrance to dried laundry.</p><p num="p0006">It would be desirable to reduce the amount of post tower addition of perfume oil for laundry detergents, which can lead to poor powder properties, and sometimes overly intense fragrance.</p><p num="p0007">It would be even more desirable that any capsule intended to provide the benefits stated above could be in a form so as to mix easily and uniformly in a detergent powder and withstand processing and manipulation during manufacture and yet be capable of rupturing on handling the laundry.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><heading><b>Summary of Invention</b></heading><p num="p0008">The present invention relates to the process of manufacturing powders containing perfume capsules by spray drying.</p><p num="p0009">The process involves (a) the preparation of a slurry which contains inorganic salts and optionally a binding agent and between 0.001% and 20% by weight based on the dried powder of the capsules and (b) spray drying the resulting slurry to form a spray dried powder.</p><p num="p0010">A preferred form of the invention is that the powder is a laundry detergent powder in which case the slurry may contain at least one detergent active of the type anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic or cationic surfactant. Part of the inorganic salts may function as the builder in the detergent as for example with phosphate or carbonate salts. Alternatively the slurry might include additional inorganic compounds such as aluminosilicate salts which function as a detergent builder. Other common ingredients of detergent powders normally added to the slurry include fluorescers, polymers such as maleic anhydride acrylic acid copolymers, sequestrants, silicone antifoams, and anti redeposition agents.</p><p num="p0011">The invention also covers any subsequent treatment of that powder necessary to prepare particles which can be incorporated directly into a laundry detergent product. So, depending on the design and operation of individual spray drying towers, granulation may be required to form particles of the appropriate size for inclusion into a detergent powder. Such granulation may be part of the same spray drying process or a separate step after the spray drying.</p><p num="p0012">Whilst it is envisaged that the powder of the invention could be used directly in laundry cleaning or conditioning, it could be blended with other ingredients typically post-dosed into spray dried detergents such as bleaches, bleach precursors, sequestrants, enzymes, colour protecting agents, further surfactants, inorganics, and fragrance as part of the detergent manufacturing process. Furthermore the capsules of the invention could be added to a detergent powder as a convenient way of adding concentrated encapsulated perfume into another pre-formed detergent powder. Alternatively the powder might be converted into another form of detergent<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> product for example the powder might be compressed or coated to form a detergent tablet which is then used for fabric treatment as part of conventional laundering.</p><p num="p0013">The use of dispersants is often advantageous for tablets.</p><p num="p0014">Preferably, the capsules used in the invention process have an average particle size of less than about 300 microns preferably an average size of not greater than 100 microns and especially a 5-50 micron average size range.</p><p num="p0015">Advantageously, the capsules used in the invention process are core shell capsules which are thermally stable at 250°C for 15 minutes.</p><heading><b>Detailed Description of Invention</b></heading><heading><b>Core Shell Capsule</b></heading><p num="p0016">The majority of laundry detergent and cleaning product compositions contain a perfume in order to give the compositions themselves or textiles treated with them a pleasant fragrance. Some perfumes include compounds which are more or less sensitive to the other chemical constituents. Moreover much of the perfume is solubilised by the surfactant and discarded without depositing onto the laundry. Yet more perfume is lost by evaporation as the laundry dries. To overcome these several problems it has already been proposed to incorporate the fragrances or perfumes in encapsulated form into the laundry detergents or cleaning products. As there are several different problems to be overcome many different types of capsules are proposed as solutions.</p><p num="p0017">Capsules based on starches or water soluble polymers are primarily intended to protect the perfume during storage and to release the perfume once mixed with water as exemplified in <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="EP1388585A" status="new"><text>EP patent 1,388,585</text></patcit> which releases perfume during the laundering process. Similarly <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="EP1196533A" status="new"><text>EP patent 1,196,533</text></patcit> which provides an oil or waxy solid encapsulated within a starch capsule will also release it on contact with water. These capsules fail the slurry stability test described below and so are outside the scope of the present invention. Capsules based on perfume incorporation into high melting waxes or polymers such as in <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="EP0469228A" status="new"><text>EP patent 0,469,228</text></patcit> which claims a perfume<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> solid composition having melting points over the range of 35 to 120° C are unlikely to retain perfume through the high temperatures of spray drying.</p><p num="p0018">A specific requirement of capsules of the present invention is that a large proportion of the capsules must survive dispersal in the warm aqueous slurry without excessive leakage of the contents and then remain intact through the exposure to high temperatures encountered during spray drying.</p><p num="p0019">Thus, suitable capsules can be defined by two tests:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li><u style="single">Slurry Survival Test</u> (Test 1): More than 40% of the encapsulated material must remain encapsulated after 60 minutes once dispersed in the slurry at 70°C in a sealed vessel without further agitation, the slurry having the following composition :

<ul list-style="bullet"><li>0.48% 7EO C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>13</sub> non-ionic, for example Neodol 23-7 (Shell)</li><li>11.4% Molecular sieve, 4A, powder, activated (of the type Zeolite 4A)</li><li>11.4% sodium sulphate</li><li>2.0% of a 40% aqueous solution of random acrylic acid / maleic acid copolymer with a molecular weight around 70000, for example the copolymer CP5 Sokalan (BASF)<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li>4.2% Sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate</li><li>0.5% aqueous dispersion of encapsulated fragrance and benefit agent, containing approximately 45% by weight capsules</li><li>70.0% water</li></ul>
must be present (still encapsulated) after spray drying through a laboratory scale spray drier, for example of the type manufactured by Buchii as the mini spray drier B-290 with the spray nozzle part No 44698. This nozzle has a hole of 0.7mm diameter, and liquid supplied via a peristaltic pump (rate approximately 560 g/hour of slurry) is mixed with compressed air at 6-8bar. The resultant droplet size is around 25µm, and this is dried with hot dry air in a co-current flow, with an inlet temperature of 145-150°C, and an outlet temperature of 55-60°C. The dry powder particles that result are 5-20µm in diameter. The amount of encapsulated material released from the dry particles can be measured by extraction of powder samples and quantitative analysis of the fragrance.</p><p num="p0022">For the purpose of the invention the core shell capsules based on formaldehyde and urea, formaldehyde and melamine, or formaldehyde and urea and melamine condensation polymers are particularly well suited although this is not intended to exclude capsules made with other monomers or incorporating other monomers or other amine aldehyde condensation polymers. Other suitable monomers for core shell capsules are for example methyl methacrylate as exemplified in <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="WO0149817A" status="new"><text>International application WO 01/49817</text></patcit>, and urethanes as exemplified in International application <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="WO03099005A" status="new"><text>WO 03/099005</text></patcit>. Suitable monomers are well known to those skilled in the art of polymerisation reactions.</p><p num="p0023">There are numerous patents teaching the application of such capsules to encapsulate water insoluble materials often perfume and to deliver these from laundry powders such as <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US5188753A" status="new"><text>US patent 5,188,753</text></patcit> which discloses a detergent composition comprising surface-active substances and perfume particles containing a perfume dispersed in a solid core of polyethylene, polyamide, polystyrene or the like, the particles being encapsulated within a friable coating made, for example, of ureaformaldehyde resins. When exposed to mechanical force, the capsules fracture and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> release the enclosed perfume. <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="WO0274430A" status="new"><text>International application WO 02/74430</text></patcit> describes a modified aminoplast capsule which reduces perfume leakage from the capsule. <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="WO9218601A" status="new"><text>International application WO 92/18601</text></patcit> teaches the use of aminoplast capsules for laundry application, among others, with the capsules having a core which solidifies at ambient temperature to improve the strength of the capsules. <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="WO0005951A" status="new"><text>International application WO 00/05951</text></patcit> describes an aminoplast capsule with a base cleavable ester moiety to trigger release under alkaline conditions.

In these polymers, the formaldehyde may be partially etherified preferably as the methyl ethers.</p><p num="p0030">Preferably, the shell is constituted of 50-100% formaldehyde-melamine or formaldehyde-melamine-urea or formaldehyde-urea condensation polymers or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> partially corresponding etherified formaldehyde condensation polymers, preferably as the methyl ethers.</p><p num="p0031">The shell may be also constituted of 50-100 % of methacrylate or urethane.</p><p num="p0032">Then, acid is added to the above mixture to adjust to a pH of 3.5 to 6.5 and the temperature raised to 30-45°C. Stirring is allowed to proceed until the dispersion is oil free. Any acid which has no adverse properties may be used in this process, such as for example formic acid or acetic acid.</p><p num="p0033">It is particularly advantageous if the capsules are cured by heating to a temperature between 60°C to 100°C for several hours under moderate stirring.</p><p num="p0034">It is particularly advantageous if during the early phase of curing a further addition of urea, melamine or other amines, or mixtures thereof can be made to reduce the formaldehyde concentration in the finished dispersion, and increase the wall thickness. Typically 10-30% additional melamine and/or urea can be added at this stage, and a particularly advantageous ratio is 5:1 to 1:1 melamine:urea.</p><p num="p0035">Once curing is complete, the temperature is reduced to around 50°C, and the dispersion is neutralized before being adjusted to a pH around 9.5.</p><p num="p0036">The final capsule dispersion as shipped should contain less than 0.1% by weight of free formaldehyde or free acetaldehyde measured by GLC or HPLC (standard methods are published by the US Environmental Protection Agency; HPLC requires derivatisation of the formaldehyde), preferably less than 100 ppm (wt/wt) and more preferably less than 10 ppm wt/wt.</p><p num="p0037">It may also be advantageous to incorporate physically or chemically further materials to improve capsule deposition to substrates or to improve deposition selectivity during application or to improve the stability of the dispersion over time during storage. Such materials as cationic polymers or copolymers e.g. polyvinyl imidazole, polysaccharides based on beta 1, 4 linkages such a guar gum, and polyester copolymers such as those sold commercially as soil release polymers for detergents are examples of suitable materials to improve deposition.</p><p num="p0038">Capsules of the above process will generally have a particle size within the range from 5-100 µm, preferably 5-70 µm, depending on the composition of the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> core material and emulsifying conditions. The capsule wall will have a thickness of 0.025 µm-1.0 µm. These parameters are important in the proper functioning of the capsules. If the capsule wall is too thin, the capsules will be too friable for subsequent shipping and handling, if too thick they might not break when required. If capsules are very small the wall material may become an uneconomically large proportion of the capsule. Very large capsules either require thicker walls or the addition of hardeners to the core to prevent breakage in handling both of which reduces the amount of beneficial agent delivered.</p><p num="p0039">The dispersion of capsules may typically contain, by weight, 2.5%-80% dispersed capsules by weight in water. Preferably the dispersion contains from 5%-70% capsules and even more preferably from 30% - 70%. In some forms of the process excess water can be removed to form either a concentrated wet cake. Since the capsules are introduced to an aqueous slurry the presence of water is not deleterious and may protect the capsules during shipping.</p><p num="p0040">Advantageously, the capsules are introduced in the slurry in the form of an aqueous dispersion of capsules.</p><heading><b>Perfume</b></heading><p num="p0041">Suitable perfumes for the composition can be composed from a wide range of perfumery raw materials well known to those skilled in the art.

It is preferable if the perfume has little or no aldehyde or amine containing raw materials. It is also preferable if more than 80% by weight of the perfume is in the range ClogP 1.5-4.5, more preferably ClogP 2-4.</p><p num="p0042">It is also preferable that materials with a low olfactive threshold are used.

The term "perfume composition" means any odoriferous material or any material which acts as a malodor counteractant. A wide variety of chemicals are known for perfumery uses, including materials such as alcohols, ketones, esters, ethers, nitriles, and the like. Without wishing to be limited, normally in most cases, the perfume compounds will have molecular weights of less than 400 mass units to ensure sufficient volatility and will not contain strongly ionizing functional groups such as sulphonates, sulphates, or quaternary ammmonium ions.</p><p num="p0045">Naturally occurring plant and animal oils and exudates or oils and exudates identical to those found in the nature, comprising complex mixtures of various chemical components are also known for use as perfumes, and such materials can be used herein. Perfume compositions of the present invention can be relatively simple in their composition with a minimum of two perfume or fragrance ingredients or can comprise highly complex mixtures of natural and synthetic chemical components, chosen to provide any desired odour. Perfume ingredients are described more fully in <nplcit id="ncit0002" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>S. Arctander, Perfume Flavors and Chemicals. Vols. I and II, Aurthor, Montclair, N.J., and the Merck Index, 8th Edition, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. Rahway, N.J</text></nplcit>., both being incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="p0046">According to one aspect of the invention it has been found that aldehydes not only react to some extent during the preparation of the capsules but surprisingly they continue reacting over time on storage within the capsule itself to an extent which may make the fragrance olfactively unacceptable. Despite the general view<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> that aldehydes are reactive species some aldehydes e.g. lilial, cyclamen aldehyde and hexyl cinnamic aldehyde are frequently used at quite high levels in fragrances for laundry products and are stable in these formulations. The perfume composition of the present invention preferably restrict the level of total aldehydes including alpha beta unsaturated aldehydes to less than 20% by weight, preferably less than 10% and even more preferably less than 1% of the perfume composition.</p><p num="p0047">It has also been found that although an excess of water soluble amines is added at the end of the capsule manufacture to remove formaldehyde, the amines present as core components show a surprising degree of stability with the capsule. Thus, the perfume composition of the invention preferably contain less than 10% by weight, and more preferably less than 1% of primary and secondary amines.</p><p num="p0048">A further aspect of the invention is that the capsule should contain more than 50% by weight, and preferably more than 60% and more preferably more than 70% and even more preferably more than 80% of perfumery ingredients. Whilst economically it would seem obvious to incorporate as much active ingredients as possible into each capsule, for many practical reasons, associated with emulsion stability, capsule integrity etc., many capsules contain other ingredients e.g. solvents, hardeners which substantially dilute the fragrance and benefit agents.</p><p num="p0049">Related to the above is the realization that the fragrance no longer plays a role in deposition so the need to choose a proportion of high ClogP (Calculated IogP) materials as taught in <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="US5652206A" status="new"><text>US patents 5,652,206</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="US5500138A" status="new"><text>5,500,138</text></patcit> for improved delivery and fragrance longevity is no longer required. Indeed, it is preferable if more volatile ingredients are selected for the fragrance to give maximum perfume impact. Thus fragrance compositions of the invention preferably contain less than 25% by weight of perfume ingredients preferably less than 20% with ClogP&gt;4 and less than 20% with ClogP &lt;2.</p><p num="p0050">ClogP refers to the octanol/water partitioning coefficient (P) of fragrance ingredients. The octanol/water partitioning coefficient of a perfume ingredient is the ratio between its equilibrium concentrations in octanol and in water. The partitioning coefficients of perfume ingredients are more conveniently given in the form of their<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> logarithm to the base 10, logP. Thus the perfume ingredients of this invention have logP of about 1.5 and higher preferably in the range 2.5 to 5. The logP of many perfume ingredients has been reported; for example, the Pomona92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, Calif., contains many, along with citations to the original literature. However, the ClogP values reported herein are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" program available within the Chemoffice Ultra Software version 9 available from CambridgeSoft Corporation, 100 CambridgePark Drive, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA or CambridgeSoft Corporation, 8 Signet Court, Swanns Road, Cambridge CB5 8LA UK. The ClogP values are preferably used instead of the experimental logP values in the selection of perfume ingredients which are useful in the present invention. For natural oils or extracts the composition of such oils can be determined by analysis or using the compositions published in the ESO 2000 database published by BACIS (Boelens Aroma Chemical Information Service, Groen van Prinsterlaan 21, 1272 GB Huizen, The Netherlands).</p><p num="p0051">Preferably, the oil or waxy solid contains 0-1 % of perfume ingredients, which are selected among :

However the greater concentration on skin or in close proximity to the skin requires additional care to formulate the core composition using only ingredients known to be safe in such a context. Among the materials known to have undesirable characteristics and therefore preferably excluded from the invention perfume compositions are nitro musks as exemplified by musk ambrette CAS 83-66-9, and musk ketone CAS 81-14-1, polycyclic musks typified by Galaxolide CAS 1222-05-5 and Tonalid CAS1506-02-1, cashmeran, geranyl nitrile, safrole, estragol, methyl eugenol, halogen containing perfumery materials.

Those fragrance ingredients alleged to be allergenic substances within the 7th amendment of the Cosmetic Directive, Directive<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> 2003/15/EC (7th amendment to Directive 76/768/EEC) and the Detergent Regulations (2004/648/EEC) are optionally restricted to below 1% by weight, preferably below 100ppm and more preferably below 10ppm of the core composition. These Directives are also amended via ATPs, for example the 26<sup>th</sup> Commission Directive 2002/34/EC. The core composition is preferably formulated so as not to require any form of classification or warning phrase, especially classification Xi or Xn due to for example the presence of amounts of raw materials classified as R43 "sensitisasion by skin contact", R36 "irritating to eyes", R38 "irritating to skin" or R21 "Harmful in contact with skin" under the Dangerous Preparations Directive (99/45/EEC).</p><p num="p0056">It is sometimes found that oxidation of certain raw materials can lead to the formation of peroxides, and that these peroxides have some health concerns. The SCCNFP (Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non Food Products for Consumers) in their opinion SCCNFP/0392/00, final, give a number of raw materials where there is concern. The oil or waxy solid has preferably a peroxide value of 0-20 millimoles peroxide / litre, preferably 0-10 millimoles peroxide / litre, and even more preferably 0-1 millimoles peroxide / litre. In particular it is desirable that if limonene (d-, l-, and dl-), and natural products containing substantial amounts of limonene, are used, they should have a peroxide value of less than 20 millimole peroxide per litre.

Benefit agents do not have to conform to the CIogP requirements as outlined for the fragrance ingredients since it is not a necessary feature of the benefit agents that they vapourise to be effective.</p><p num="p0065">Benefit agents include natural extracts or materials which have therapeutic effects as relaxants or stimulants, e.g. aromatherapy oils, whether odiferous or not. Natural oils or plant extracts which are beneficial to skin such as jojoba oil or almond oil are also benefit agents. Vitamins or vitamin derivatives such as ascorbyl palmitate (CAS 137-66-6) tocopheryl acetate (CAS 58-95-7) or retinyl palmitate (CAS 79-81-2) are also benefit agents within this definition. Materials which suppress or reduce malodour and its perception by any of the many mechanisms proposed are benefit agents such as zinc ricinoleate (CAS 13040-19-2). Materials which when added to the emulsion improve the properties of the core emulsion before encapsulation, or the properties of the capsules themselves.

Materials which act as antimicrobial agents as exemplified by triclosan<sup>™</sup> (CAS N° 3380-34-5), the methyl-ethyl, propyl and butyl para hydroxy benzoate esters (CAS N° 4247-02-3, 94-26-8, 94-13-3, 120-47-8, 99-76-3), 2-phenoxyethanol, 3-iodopropynyl-2-butylcarbamate (CAS N° 55406-53-6), 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3 diol (CAS N° 52-51-7) and natural oils such as clove oil, pine oil, cinnamon oil, and tea tree oil are benefit agents. Materials which act as antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyl toluene or butylated hydroxyanisole or pentaerythrityl tetra- di- t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, octadecyl di t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (CAS N° 2082-79-3), tetrabutyl ethylidenebisphenol (CAS N° 35958-30-6) are benefit agents.

The materials listed above are intended to exemplify the benefit agents but are not intented to limit the benefit agents to this list. Mixtures of the above may also be considered as benefit agents of the invention. Thus it may be advantageous to combine UV absorbers with antioxidants to protect the fragrance ingredients or to combine an anti-fungal agent with a bacteriocide for broader antimicrobial protection. Moreover it is recognized that some materials may exhibit more than one benefit.

The slurry has typically a water content of between 30%-60% and commonly comprises a builder, a neutralized or acid-form anionic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, a neutralizing alkali such as soda ash or sodium carbonate, an inorganic salt or salts such as sodium sulphate, water, processing aids, and organic polymers in a crutcher. The detergent slurry is pumped to the top of a spray drying tower, and sprayed from nozzles in the tower to form atomized droplets. These compositions could also be prepared by continuous slurry making. By continuous slurry making is meant a process in which components are fed continuously and substantially simultaneously to a slurry making vessel while mixed slurry is removed to the spray tower at a rate which maintains an essentially constant volume in the vessel.</p><p num="p0072">Hot air is pumped through the spray drying towers such that when the atomized droplets are sprayed into the hot air, they dry into a powder as the free moisture evaporates. The spray-dried granules thus formed are then collected at the bottom of the tower. Numerous patents teach specific modifications to this basic protocol in order to better produce powders with specific properties. <patcit id="pcit0025" dnum="US4269722A" status="new"><text>US patent 4,269,722</text></patcit> teaches spray drying especially porous particles to incorporate nonionic surfactant. <patcit id="pcit0026" dnum="GB1473201A" status="new"><text>GB patent 1,473,201</text></patcit> teaches spray drying compositions containing zeolite. <patcit id="pcit0027" dnum="EP1499703A" status="new"><text>EP patent 1,499,703</text></patcit> describes the manufacture of powders having low anionic surfactant content while <patcit id="pcit0028" dnum="US4900466A" status="new"><text>US patent 4,900,466</text></patcit> describes the preparation of particles having defined pores by varying the ratio of inorganic salts in a composition with little or no surfactant but using a polymeric binder.

However none describe mixing a fragrance containing capsule with inorganic salts for spray drying to produce larger particles.</p><p num="p0074">The benefits of adding the capsule dispersion to the slurry rather than by post addition are:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>there is no drying step required, as the wet capsule dispersion is added directly to the slurry ;</li><li>no additional agglomeration step is needed to create a sufficiently large particle to remain mixed in a range of detergent powders ;</li><li>the capsule is protected within the larger detergent granule and is less liable to breakage in the subsequent processing of the detergent.</li></ul></p><p num="p0075">Depending on the design and operating parameters of specific spray drying towers, the characteristics of the powder particles will be affected. Typically conventional spray dried detergent powders have bulk densities of 200-550 kgm<sup>-3</sup> and particle sizes concentrated around 250-700 µm. In some instances it is possible to produce much finer and denser powders. These may not disperse uniformly within a detergent powder and so it is preferable if the powder is more agglomerated. This may be achieved in the spray drying tower by adding some steam to the powder or separately in a fluid bed mixer.</p><p num="p0076">Examples of the composition of a range powders (often termed "blown powder" or "base powder") which can be prepared by spray drying can be found in <patcit id="pcit0029" dnum="WO9965458A" status="new"><text>International application WO 99/65458</text></patcit> which is incorporated herein by reference.
