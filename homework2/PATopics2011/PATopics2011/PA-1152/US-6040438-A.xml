Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention is directed to a method of synthesizing sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs by reacting an oligonucleotide analog containing a trivalent phosphorous linkage with a dithiocarbonic acid diester polysulfide.</p><p>2. Discussion of the Background</p><p>It is well-known that most of the bodily states in mammals, including most disease states, are effected by proteins. By acting directly or through their enzymatic functions, proteins contribute in major proportion to many diseases in animals and man.</p><p>Classical therapeutics has generally focused on interactions with such proteins in an effort to moderate their disease causing or disease potentiating functions. Recently, however, attempts have been made to directly inhibit the production of proteins involved in disease by interacting with the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that direct their synthesis. These interactions have involved the hybridization of complementary, or antisense, oligonucleotides or oligonucleotides analogs to mRNA. Hybridization is the sequence-specific hydrogen bonding of an oligonucleotide or oligonucleotide analog to an mRNA sequence via Watson-Crick hydrogen bond formation. Interfering with the production of proteins involved in disease would provide maximum therapeutic results with minimum side effects.</p><p>The pharmacological activity of antisense oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs depends on a number of factors that influence the effective concentration of these agents at specific intracellular targets. One important factor for oligonucleotides and analogs thereof is their stability to nucleases. It is unlikely that unmodified oligonucleotides containing phosphodiester linkages will be useful therapeutic agents because they are rapidly degraded by nucleases. Modified oligonucleotides which are nuclease resistant are therefore greatly desired.</p><p>Phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate oligonucleotide analogs which have one or both of the non-bridging oxygens of the natural phosphodiester linkage replaced with sulphur, respectively, are especially promising antisense therapeutics. These oligonucleotide analogs are highly resistant to nucleases, have the same charge as natural phosphodiester-containing oligonucleotides, and are taken up by cells in therapeutically effective amounts. See, for example, Baracchini et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,239; Ecker, U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,438; Bennett et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,788; and Ecker et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,389.</p><p>Phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate oligonucleotide analogs are conveniently synthesized with automated DNA synthesizers using hydrogen phosphonate chemistry which permits the phosphonate backbone to be sulfurized in a single step after automated synthesis. One drawback of this approach is that coupling yields during chain synthesis are typically lower than those obtained using phosphoramidite chemistry. The final yield of the desired oligonucleotide analog is therefore too low due to the low individual coupling yields.</p><p>Automated synthesis using phosphoramidite chemistry is a highly desirable approach to the synthesis of these sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs, with coupling yields typically greater than 99%. However, the phosphorous(III)-containing phosphite intermediates are unstable under the conditions of the detritylation step of the synthesis cycle. Therefore, these phosphorous(III) linkages must be sulfurized after each coupling step.</p><p>A more recent method for the synthesis of oligonucleotide analogs is the "blockmer" approach. In blockmer synthesis, an oligonucleotide analog is made by the sequential coupling of short protected oligomers or blocks, e.g., a dinucleotide, on a solid support. This strategy offers several advantages over the conventional synthetic approach which involves the sequential coupling of monomeric nucleoside phosphoramidites. The number of synthesis cycles required to prepare an oligonucleotide analog is reduced, saving time and minimizing reagent consumption. The blocks may be prepared on a large scale using inexpensive solution phase synthesis techniques. In order to prepare sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs by the blockmer method, a reagent for sulfuring the phosphorous(III) linkages of the blocks on a large scale is required. The blockmer approach is described in the following references: Ravikumar et al, WO 95/32980; WO 94/15947; Journal of Organic Chemistry 1984, 49, 4905-4912; Helevetica Chimica Acta 1985, 68, 1907-1913; Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1987, 35, 833-836.</p><p>There are several reagents available for sulfurizing the phosphite intermediates during automated oligonucleotide synthesis. All of these reagents have drawbacks which limit their use for synthesizing sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs.</p><p>Elemental sulfur, for example, has been used to sulfurize phosphorous(III) linkages in solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. However, elemental sulphur is not suitable for use with automated synthesizers because of its poor solubility in standard solvents and slow sulfurization rate. In addition, carbon disulfide, the preferred solvent for elemental sulphur, is highly volatile and has a low flash point. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,252,723 and 5,449,769.</p><p>The Beaucage reagent, 3H-1,2-benzodithiol-3-one, is a considerably more efficient sulfurizing agent. However, this reagent precipitates from solution and clogs the solvent and reagent transfer lines of an automated DNA synthesizer. Also, the by-product formed during the sulfurization reaction is a potent oxidizing agent. This by-product can lead to side products, e.g., phosphodiesters, which are difficult to separate from the desired sulfurized oligonucleotides. In addition, the preparation of this reagent involves expensive and toxic materials, and is therefore not amenable for large-scale synthesis of sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,097.</p><p>Tetraethylthiuram disulfide is an inexpensive and chemically stable sulfurization reagent. However, the sulfurization rate is slow and therefore a significant molar excess of this reagent is required. Even with an excess of this reagent, sulfurization yields are unacceptably low. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,387.</p><p>Phenylacetyl disulfide may be used to sulfurize phosphite intermediates during automated oligonucleotide synthesis. However, this reagent has not been reported to be useful for large-scale synthesis of sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs. See, Recherches Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas 1991, 110, 325-331; Tetrahedron Letters 1989, 30, 6757-6760; Synthesis 1981, 637-638.</p><p>Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for methods and reagents for synthesizing sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs which overcome these problems.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>An object of the present invention is to provide a method of synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide using a reagent that efficiently sulfurizes a phosphorous(III) linkage in an oligonucleotide analog.</p><p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide using a reagent that does not require the use of solvents having a high volatility and flash point.</p><p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide using a reagent that is highly soluble in organic solvents and does not precipitate from solution.</p><p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide using a reagent that is useful in automated solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotide analogs.</p><p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide using a reagent that is compatible with large-scale and small-scale synthesis using solution phase methods.</p><p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a sulfurizing reagent composition that may be used to sulfurize a phosphorous(III) linkage of an oligonucleotide analog.</p><p>These objects and others may be accomplished with a method of synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide analog by reacting an oligonucleotide analog containing a phosphorus(III) linkage capable of being sulfurized with a thiodicarbonic acid diester polysulfide having the formula: ##STR2## where each R is an inert side chain, and n is 2, 3 or 4.</p><p>The above objects may also be accomplished with a method of synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide analog by:</p><p>(a) providing a nucleoside analog having a blocked hydroxyl group;</p><p>(b) deblocking the blocked hydroxyl group to produce a free hydroxyl group;</p><p>(c) reacting the free hydroxyl group with a protected nucleoside analog phosphoramidite or a protected nucleoside analog phosphorothioamidite having a blocked hydroxyl group to produce an oligonucleotide analog containing a phosphorous(III) linkage and a blocked hydroxyl group;</p><p>(d) reacting the phosphorous(III) linkage with a reagent selected from the group consisting of an oxidizing agent and a dithiocarbonic acid diester polysulfide to produce an oxidized or sulfurized phosphorous(V) linkage;</p><p>(e) repeating steps (b) through (d) at least once to produce a sulfurized oligonucleotide analog, wherein at least one step (d) in the method is reacting the phosphorous(III) linkage with the dithiocarbonic acid diester polysulfide of the present invention.</p><p>The above objects may also be accomplished with a sulfurizing reagent composition containing an effective amount of thiodicarbonic acid diester polysulfide for sulfurizing a phosphorous(III) linkage of an oligonucleotide analog and at least one solvent.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description.</p><p>As used in the present invention, the term "oligonucleotide analog" includes linear oligomers of natural or modified nucleosides linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs thereof ranging in size from two monomeric units to several hundred monomeric units. Oligonucleotide analogs include modifications of the heterocyclic base moiety and/or the sugar portion of a component nucleotide. In particular, the term includes non-natural oligomers containing phosphorus(III) linkages which are amenable to sulfurization. Preferably, the modifications do not inhibit the ability of an oligonucelotide analog to bind to a target nucleic acid. The term "sulfurized oligonucleotide analog" is an oligonucleotide analog containing at least one analog of a phosphodiester linkage in which one or both of the non-bridging oxygen atoms are replaced by sulfur. The term "nucleoside analog" refers to a natural or modified nucleoside. In particular, this term includes nucleosides that are modified at the heterocyclic base and/or sugar to enhance hybridization to the target nucleic acids. It is to be understood that the stereochemical relationship between the sugar substituents in the nucleoside and oligonucleotide analogs disclosed herein is preferably the same as that of naturally-occurring DNA and RNA, see G. M. Blackburn and M. J. Gait (eds.), Nucleic Acids in Chemistry and Biology (ILR Press, 1990), Chapter 2, pp. 19-70.</p><p>The thiodicarbonic acid diester polysulfide of the present invention preferably has the formula: ##STR3## where each R is preferably an inert group. These groups preferably do not contain any reactive moieties which could lead to side reactions or poor yields in the sulfurization reaction. Preferably, each R is independently C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 alkyl, substituted C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 alkyl, C.sub.2 -C.sub.8 heterocycloalkyl containing up to three heteroatoms, substituted C.sub.2 -C.sub.8 heterocycloalkyl containing up to three heteroatoms, C.sub.6 -C.sub.14 aryl, substituted C.sub.6 -C.sub.14 aryl, C.sub.3 -C.sub.11 hetaryl containing up to three heteroatoms, substituted C.sub.3 -C.sub.11 hetaryl containing up to three heteroatoms, C.sub.7 -C.sub.18 aralkyl, substituted C.sub.7 -C.sub.18 aralkyl, C.sub.4 -C.sub.15 heterocycloaralkyl containing up to three heteroatoms or substituted C.sub.4 -C.sub.15 heterocycloaralkyl containing up to three heteroatoms. The term "C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 alkyl" includes linear, branched and cyclic alkyl groups. The term "substituted" means that up to three hydrogen atoms in the group are substituted with up to three halogen, nitro, cyano, C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 alkyl, O--C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 alkyl, N--C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 alkyl, S--C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 alkyl groups or combinations thereof. More preferably, each R is independently C.sub.2 -C.sub.8 alkyl, C.sub.6 -C.sub.14 aryl or substituted C.sub.6 -C.sub.14 aryl. Most preferably, each R is independently ethyl or p-chlorophenyl. The dithiocarbonic acid diester polysulfide may be a disulfide, trisulfide or tetrasulfide, i.e., n is 2, 3 or 4, respectively. Preferably n is 2 or 3, and more preferably, n is 2.</p><p>The thiodicarbonic acid diester polysulfide may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding thiodicarbonic acid or acid salt with oxidizing agents, such as iodine or bromine. Methods of synthesis and properties of these polysulfides are described in the following references: Barany et al, Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1983, 48, 4750-4761; W. F. Zeise, J. Prakt. Chem. 1845, 36, 352-362; Losse et al., J. Prakt. Chem. 1961, 13, 260; S. R. Rao, Xanthates and Related Compounds, (M. Decker, New York, 1971); Bulmer et al, J. Chem. Soc. 1945, 674-677.</p><p>The thiodicarbonic acid diester polysulfide of the present invention is an efficient reagent for sulfurizing phosphorous(III) linkages in oligonucleotide analogs. The reagent does not precipitate out of solution, even on prolonged storage. The reagent may be used in solution phase synthesis and is particularly useful in solid-phase synthesis of oligonucleotide analogs with automated DNA synthesizers. The reagent is particularly useful in large-scale synthesis, using either solution phase or solid phase techniques.</p><p>When used to sulfurize phosphorus(III) linkages in oligonucleotide analogs, the thiodicarbonic acid diester polysulfide is preferably delivered to the oligonucleotide analog in a suitable organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, dichloroethane and collidine. These solvents may be used singly or as mixtures in any proportion. Preferable solvents are pyridine, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof. Pyridine is most preferred. The reagent may be used at any effective concentration for sulfurizing a phosphorous(III) linkage, preferably between 0.01 M to 1.5 M, more preferably from 0.2 to 1.2 M; and most preferably from 0.5 to 1.0 M.</p><p>The sulfurization reaction may be conducted at any convenient temperature, preferably from 0 to 70 C.; and most preferably at about room temperature, i.e., 18 to 25 C. The sulfurization reaction is preferably conducted for 30 seconds to 15 minutes, more preferably, 1 to 15 minutes; and most preferably, 3 to 10 minutes. Preferably, sulfurization is performed under anhydrous conditions with the exclusion of air.</p><p>The present method for synthesizing a sulfurized oligonucleotide analog may be applied to any oligonucleotide analog containing at least one phosphorus(III) linkage which is amenable to sulfurization. In particular, the present method is useful for sulphurizing phosphite triesters, thiophosphite triesters, and hydrogen phosphonates. More preferably, the phosphorus(III) linkage is a phosphite triester or a thiophosphite triester. Most preferably, the phosphorus(III) linkage is a phosphite triester.</p><p>Detailed procedures for synthesizing oligonucleotide analogs containing at least one phosphorus(III) linkages are well-known in the art and are described in the following references: M. J. Gait (ed.), Oligonucleotide Synthesis, A Practical Approach (ILR Press, 1984); J. S. Cohen (ed.), Oligonucleotides: Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla., 1989).</p><p>Preferably, the dithiocarbonic acid diester polysulfide of the present invention is used in conjunction with the phosphoramidite or phosphorothioamidite synthetic approaches. Synthesis may be conducted in solution phase or using solid phase techniques. More preferably, the synthesis is conducted using a solid support. Most preferably, the synthesis is conducted on a solid support using an automated DNA synthesizer, e.g., an APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS model 380B or a similar machine.</p><p>Preferably, this synthetic approach involves the following steps: (1) deprotecting a blocked reactive functionality on the growing oligonucleotide analog chain or on the first nucleoside analog monomer, to produce a deblocked reactive functionality, (2) reacting an appropriately blocked and protected nucleoside analog phosphoramidite or phosphorothioamidite monomer with the deblocked reactive functionality of the growing nucleotide analog chain, preferably in the presence of an activator, to form an oligonucleotide analog containing a phosphorus(III) linkage, (3) capping any unreacted functionalities, and (4) sulfurizing the newly-formed phosphorus(III) linkage with the thiodicarbonic acid diester polysulfide to obtain the phosphorus atom in a sulfurized pentacoordinate state.</p><p>The term "blocked" means that a reactive functionality, usually a nucleophile, e.g., a 5' hydroxyl, is protected with a group that may be selectively removed. Preferably, these blocking groups are labile to dilute acid, e.g. dichloroacetic acid in dichloromethane, and are stable to base. Preferable blocking groups include 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl (DmTr), monomethoxytrityl, diphenylmethyl, phenylxanthen-9-yl (pixyl) or 9-(p-methoxyphenyl)xanthen-9-yl (Mox). The 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl group is most preferred. Throughout the present disclosure the labile 5' blocking group is represented as "R.sup.6 ".</p><p>Any natural or non-natural heterocyclic base may be used in the present invention, such as adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil, 2-aminopurine, inosine, substituted pyrimidines, e.g., 5-methylcytosine, and 5-nitropyrrole. Other suitable heterocyclic bases are described by Merigan et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808. Preferably, the heterocyclic base is attached to C-1 of the sugar moiety of nucleoside analog phosphoramidite (1) via a nitrogen of the base. Throughout the present disclosure the heterocyclic base is respresented as "B".</p><p>During synthesis these heterocyclic groups are preferably protected to prevent any reactive group, e.g., an exocyclic amino group, to prevent undesired side reactions. The term "protected" means that reactive moieties such as exocyclic amino groups, 2'-hydroxyl groups, oxygen or sulfur bonded to phosphorus atoms, and the like, have protective groups which are generally removed after synthesis of the oligonucleotide analog is completed. Preferably, these protective groups are labile to a base and/or a nucleophile. This term also includes oligonucleotide and nucleoside analogs which have groups that do not require such protection, e.g., heterocyclic bases such as thymine or abasic nucleosides.</p><p>Preferable protecting groups for the heterocyclic bases include base labile groups. The exocyclic amino groups of the heterocyclic groups are preferably protected with acyl groups that are removed by base treatment after synthesis of the sulfurized oligonucleotide analog. Preferably, these protecting groups are C.sub.2 -C.sub.10 acyl groups. N-benzoyl and N-isobutyryl protecting groups are particularly preferred. Adenine is preferably protected as an N.sup.2 -isobutyryl derivative. Guanine is preferably protected as an N.sup.6 -isobutyryl derivative.

The standard synthesis protocol was followed, except that in place of the oxidation step a sulfurization step was substituted, and this step preceded the capping step. In other words, synthesis consisted of repeated cycles of detritylation, coupling, sulfurization, and capping.

The trityl yield is both a measure of coupling efficiency and a measure of the extent of sulfurization, since non-sulfurized trivalent phosphorus linkages in the oligonucleotide are labile to cleavage during detritylation. The 19-mer was cleaved from the support and deprotected with concentrated ammonium hydroxide under standard conditions and isolated using techniques well-known in the art.</p><heading>Example 8</heading><heading>Large-Scale Synthesis of a 20-mer Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotide Analog</heading><p>A 20-base phosphorothioate oligonucleotide analog of sequence 5'-TCCCGCCTGTGACATGCATT-3' was synthesized by the phosphormidite method on an OligoPilot automated DNA synthesizer (available from Pharmacia, Sweden).
