No. 5,852,137 Jan. 29, 1997.</p><?description-type Brief Summary?><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>This invention relates to polyurethane sealant compositions which are capable of being used without the need for a primer.</p><p>Polyurethane sealant compositions typically comprise at least one urethane prepolymer. Sealants useful for bonding to non-porous substrates, such as glass are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,374,237 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,533, both incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 4,374,237 describes a polyurethane sealant containing urethane prepolymers which have been further reacted with secondary amine compounds containing two silane groups. U.S. Pat. No. 4,687,533 describes a polyurethane sealant containing urethane prepolymers which contain silane groups which have been prepared by reacting a polyisocyanate having at least three isocyanate groups with less than an equivalent amount of an alkoxysilane having a terminal group containing active hydrogen atoms reactive with isocyanate groups to form an isocyanatosilane having at least two unreacted isocyanate groups. In a second step, the isocyanatosilane is mixed with additional polyisocyanate and the mixture is reacted with a polyol to form a polyurethane prepolymer having terminal isocyanato groups and pendant alkoxysilane groups.</p><p>However, when such sealants are used to bond glass substrates to painted substrates, such as for window installation in vehicle manufacturing, the lap shear strength of the bonded substrate may be less than desirable for safety or structural purposes. Consequently, a separate paint primer comprising a solution of one or more silanes is typically applied to a painted substrate prior to the application of the sealant in most vehicle assembly operations for bonding the windshield and the rear window. The use of a primer in assembly operations is undesirable in that it introduces an extra step, additional cost, the risk of marring the paint surface if dripped on an undesired location and exposes the assembly line operators to additional chemicals. It would be desirable to provide a polyurethane sealant which, when bonded to a painted substrate and cured, provides a bonded substrate with a higher lap shear strength, particularly when used in the absence of a paint primer.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In one aspect, this invention is a polyurethane sealant composition comprising (1) a urethane prepolymer having an isocyanate functionality of at least about 2.0 and a weight average molecular weight of at least about 2,000; and (2) a catalytic amount of (a) a substantially active hydrogen free glycol acid salt of a tertiary amine and an organo metallic compound, (b) a mixture of a substantially active hydrogen free glycol acid salt of a tertiary amine and an organo metallic compound and a second organometallic compound, or (c) a mixture of a dialkyl tin dicarboxylate with dimorpholinodialkyl ether or a di ((dialkylmorpholino)alkyl) ether.</p><p>In another embodiment, the polyurethane sealant composition further comprises (A) a silane, or (B) an adduct of an isocyanate reactive silane and a polyisocyanate, (C) the reaction product of (1) (a) an isocyanate reactive silane or (b) an adduct of an isocyanate reactive silane and a polyisocyanate with (2) (a) a polyisocyanate and an active hydrogen containing compound or (b) a polyurethane prepolymer which has free isocyanate moieties; which reaction product has an average of at least one silane group and at least one isocyanate group per molecule.</p><p>In another embodiment the invention is a method for bonding glass to a substrate which comprises contacting a sealant according to the invention with glass and another substrate with the sealant disposed between the glass and substrate and thereafter allowing the sealant to cure so as to bind the glass to the substrate.</p><p>The sealant composition of the invention is useful in bonding glass substrates to plastic, metal, fiberglass and composite substrates which may or may not be painted. It has been discovered to give unexpectedly high lap shear strength when no primer compositions have previously been applied to a painted plastic, metal, fiberglass or composite substrate.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Suitable urethane prepolymers for use in preparing the composition of the invention include any compound having an average isocyanate functionality of at least about 2.0 and a molecular weight of at least about 2,000. Preferably, the average isocyanate functionality of the prepolymer is at least about 2.2, and is more preferably at least about 2.4. Preferably the isocyanate functionality is no greater than about 4.0, more preferably, no greater than about 3.5 and most preferably, no greater than abpout 3 Preferably, the weight average molecular weight of the prepolymer is at least about 2,500, and is more preferably at least about 3,000; and is preferably no greater than about 40,000, even more preferably, no greater than about 20,000, more preferably, no greater than about 15,000, and is most preferably, no greater than about 10,000. The prepolymer may be prepared by any suitable method, such as by reacting an isocyanate-reactive compound containing at least two isocyanate-reactive groups with an excess over stoichiometry of a polyisocyanate under reaction conditions sufficient to form the corresponding prepolymer.</p><p>Suitable polyisocyanates for use in preparing the prepolymer include any aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic polyisocyanate, or mixture thereof. Preferably the polyisocyanates used have an average isocyanate functionality of at least about 2.0 and an equivalent weight of at least about 80. Preferably, the isocyanate functionality of the polyisocyanate is at least about 2.0, more preferably at least about 2.2, and is most preferably at least about 2.4; and is preferably no greater than about 4.0, more preferably no greater than about 3.5, and is most preferably no greater than about 3 Higher functionalities may also be used, but may cause excessive cross-linking, and result in an adhesive which is too viscous to handle and apply easily, and can cause the cured adhesive to be too brittle.

The reaction is suitably carried out in heat or in an inert liquid diluent or carrier. While any of the conventional inert organic solvents such as the benzene, toluene, xylene and other hydrocarbons or halohydrocarbons can be employed, it is preferable to use a compound having plasticizing properties, since the use of a plasticizer avoids the need for isolating the active reaction products from the reaction mixtures.</p><p>The reactions to prepare the prepolymer and the adduct may be carried out in the presence of urethane catalysts.

By the addition of such materials, physical properties such as viscosity, flow rate, sag, and the like can be modified.

Alternatively, the plasticizers can be added during blending of all the components. Once the sealant composition is formulated, it is packaged in a suitable container such that it is protected from atmospheric moisture. Contact with atmospheric moisture could result in premature crosslinking of the polyurethane prepolymer-containing isocyanate groups.</p><p>The sealant composition of the invention is used to bond porous and nonporous substrates together. The sealant composition is applied to a substrate and the adhesive on the first substrate is thereafter contacted with a second substrate. Thereafter the adhesive is exposed to curing conditions.

In preferred embodiments, the surfaces to which the adhesive is applied are cleaned prior to application, see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,525,511, 3,707,521 and 3,779,794. Generally the sealants of the invention are applied at ambient temperature in the presence of atmospheric moisture. Exposure to atmospheric moisture is sufficient to result in curing of the sealant. Curing may be further accelerated by applying heat to the curing sealant by means of convection heat, or microwave heating. Preferably the sealant of the invention is formulated to provide a working time of 6 minutes or greater more preferably 10 minutes or greater. Preferably the working time is 15 minutes or less and more preferably 12 minutes or less.</p><p>Molecular weights as described herein are determined according to the following procedure: determined using the Waters Model 590 Gel Permeation Chromatograph.

A column of styrogel is used for the size exclusion and it can determine molecular weights from 250 to 50,000. The molecular weight of the prepolymer is then determined by measuring the elution volume through this column using tetrahydrofuran as the eluting solvent. The molecular weight is then calculated from a calibration curve of molecular weight vs. elution volume obtained from a polystyrene polyethylene glycol column. The quoted molecular weights are weight average molecular weights unless otherwise specified.</p><p>In reference to polyurethane prepolymers, average isocyanate functionality is determined according to the following formula, ##EQU1## wherein moles excess polyisocyanate monomer are calculated according to the following formula,</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->moles of isocyanate-(2</pre></p><p>and the moles of isocyanate, diol and triol are based on the amount of each in the starting formulation.</p><p>The theoretical average molecular weight of the prepolymer is calculated as equal to the average isocyanate functionality times the isocyanate equivalent weight of the prepolymer.</p><p>Functionality of the raw material is generally disclosed by the raw material supplier. It can be determined empirically by means of titrating the polyol or isocyanate to determine the average number functional group per molecule.

For the sealant of the invention, adhesion of a sealant develops sooner to the treated substrate than to the untreated one.</p><p>Lap Shear Test:</p><p>A sealant approximately 6.3 mm wide by 8 mm high is applied along the width of the glass and approximately 6 mm to 12 mm from the primed end. The paint substrate is immediately placed on the sealant and the sample is allowed to cure at the condition of the 23 relative humidity for 5 days. The sample was then pulled at a rate of 1 inch/minute (2.5 cm/min)with an Instron Tester.</p><p>Environmental Tests:</p><p>Short term environmental tests include four weeks in the condition of 24 C, 50 percent RH, four weeks in a 90 32 according to SAE J 1960 and SAE J 1885.</p><p>Quick Adhesion Test:</p><p>A 4 sealant tube on to a primed glass plate. A paint substrate is immediately placed on the top of the sealant bead. This assembly is allowed to cure at the 23 specific length of time and then the two substrates were separated by pulling in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the sealant bead at 10 inches per minute (25.4 cm per minute). The curing rate is recorded in pounds per square inch (kilopascals) at the elapsed time after assembly.</p><p>The stability of the sealant on storage is evaluated by determining the flow rates of a sealant before and after aging at 130 (54 in seconds required to extrude 20 grams of the sealant through an orifice 0.157 inch (0.4 cm) in diameter under a pressure of 80 pounds per square inch (551 kPa). Percent growth in press flow after aging will indicate the stability of the sealant on storage.</p><p>The sealant in the Example 5 had a very good accelerated storage stability as shown in press flows of 19 and 20 seconds respectively before and after aging at 130 test showed that the sealant adhered in one day to the IPA wiped acid resistant paint and in 2 days to the untreated one. In lap shear testing, the sealant developed an average lap shear strength of 544 psi (3748 kPa) on both the treated and untreated paint substrates after 5 day cure at the condition of 23 168 psi (1157 kpa)of tear strength and 1085 psi (7476 kPa) of tensile strength and 270 percent elongation at break. The cure rate by the Quick adhesion test, for this sealant were: 4 psi (28 kPa) at 1.5 hour, 24 psi (165 kPa) at 3 hours and 84 psi (579 kPa) at 6 hours.</p><heading>EXAMPLES 6</heading><p>This sealant has the same composition as the sealant in the Example 5 except that a combination of 6 grams of the modified catalyst in the Example 4 and 5 grams of dimorpholinodiethyl ether (DMDEE) was used instead of 14 grams of the modified catalyst alone. The cured sealant has similar adhesion and physical properties as the sealant in Example 5. The cure rates by the Quick adhesion test at the condition of 23 and 50 percent RH, for this sealant were: 23 psi (158 kPa) at 1.5 hour, 63 psi (434 kPa) at 3 hours and 100 psi (689 kPa) at 6 hours. When exposed to the SAE J 1960 condition, the cured lap shear samples prepared from this material using glass primer on the glass side and no paint primer on the IPA wiped paint substrate, exhibited an average lap shear strength of 525 psi (3617 kPa), 100 percent cohesive failure within the sealant after 2,000 hours of exposure.</p><heading>EXAMPLES 7</heading><p>Additional moisture curable sealants were also prepared in the same fashion as described in Example 5. Their compositions and adhesion properties by Quick Knife Adhesion to acid resistant paint are tabulated below.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 1______________________________________Ingredient  (% by weight) Ex-7 Ex-8 Ex-9 Ex-10 Ex-11 Ex-12______________________________________Prepolymer  1021   1089   --   1089  1089  1021  in Example 1  Prepolymer -- -- 1115 -- -- --  in Example 3  TMSPA 15 5 -- 17 15 15  Silane Adduct 55 -- -- -- -- 55  in Example 2  Desmodur -- 13 45 68 -- 64  N-3300  PAPI 2020 -- 35 -- -- -- --  Carbon Black 500 450 450 375 450 500  Calcium  Carbonate -- -- -- 274 -- --  Catalyst in 18 35 6 7 6 6  Example 4  Bismuth -- -- -- -- -- --  Octoate  Stannous -- -- -- -- -- --  Octoate  DMDEE 5 -- 5 6 5 5  1-Methyl-2- -- -- -- -- -- --  pyrrolidinone  Alkyl Phthalate 10 -- -- -- -- --  Plasticizer  Total 1624 1637 1621 1836 1565 1666  Days required to have  adhesion to substrate  with wipe 1 5 1 1 6 2  without wipe 2 5 2 1 &amp;gt;10 4______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 2__________________________________________________________________________Ingredient  (% by weight) Ex-13 Ex-14 Ex-15 Ex-16 Ex-17 Ex-18 Ex-19 Ex-20__________________________________________________________________________Prepolymer     1089         1089             1089                 1089                     1089                         1089 1089 938  in Example 1  TMSPA 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 --  Silane Adduct -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 165  in Example 2  Desmodur 71 71 71 71 71 65 65 --  N-3300  Catalyst in 6 6 6 -- 6 -- -- --  Example 4  Bismuth -- -- -- -- -- 8 -- --  Octoate  Stannous -- -- -- -- -- -- 2 --  Octoate  DMDEE 3 5 5 5 5 -- -- 5  1,1,Dimethyl Tin -- -- -- 0.2 0.2 -- -- --  Dilaurate  Alkylphthalate -- -- -- 1.8 1.8 -- -- 35  Plasticizer  1,1,Dibutyl Tin 2 -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Diacetate  1,1,Dimethyl Tin -- -- 2 -- -- -- -- --  Mercaptide  1-Methyl-2- -- -- -- -- -- 20 20 --  pyrrolidinone  Dimethyl tin -- 2 -- -- -- -- -- --  dimaleate  Carbon Black 493 493 493 493 493 450 450 500  Total 1679 1681 1681 1675 1681 1647 1641 1643  Days required to have  adhesion to substrate  with wipe 1 1 1 1 1 no no no  without wipe 2 2 2 1 1 adhesion adhesion adhesion__________________________________________________________________________</pre></p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What is claimed is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
