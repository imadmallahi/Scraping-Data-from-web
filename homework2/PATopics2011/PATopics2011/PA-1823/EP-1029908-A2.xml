for an oil based drilling fluid and specifically a synthetic
hydrocarbon continuous phase which is non-polluting and minimally
toxic. The invention provides excellent drilling fluid properties
under a wide variety of drilling conditions. The synthetic
hydrocarbons are selected from the group consisting of branched
chain oligomers synthesized from one or more olefins containing a
C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>14</sub> chain length and wherein the oligomers have an average
molecular weight of from 120 to 1000. In the drilling fluid
compositions, suitable emulsifiers, wetting agents, viscosifiers,
weight materials and fluid loss additives are utilized in
conjunction with water and/or a brine phase for the desired
rheological properties.

the drilling of subterranean oil and gas wells as well as other
drilling fluid applications and drilling procedures. The
invention is particularly concerned with non-polluting, minimally
toxic drilling fluids which are based on synthetic hydrocarbons,
having molecular weights of from 120 to 1000, derived from
olefinic monomers and displaying functional characteristics,
e.g., viscosity characteristics, acceptable in drilling fluid
applications. The olefinic monomers are from the groups
consisting of a carbon chain from C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>14</sub> having at least one
polymerizible double bond. The oligomeric or polymeric synthetic
hydrocarbons thus obtained from olefins exhibit minimal toxicity
toward aquatic life and possess valuable rheological properties
when used in drilling fluids.</p><p num="0002">In rotary drilling there are a variety of functions and
characteristics that are expected of a drilling fluid ("drilling
mud" or simply "mud"). The drilling fluid is expected to carry
cuttings from beneath the bit, transport them up the annulus, and
permit their separation at the surface while at the same time the
rotary bit is cooled and cleaned. A drilling mud is also
intended to reduce friction between the drill string and the
sides of the hole while maintaining the stability of uncased
sections of the borehole. Likewise the drilling fluid is
formulated to prevent unwanted influxes of formation fluids from
permeable rocks penetrated and likewise to form a thin, low
permeability filter cake which seals pores and other openings and
formations penetrated by the bit. Finally, the drilling fluid is 
used to collect and interpret information available from drill
cuttings, cores and electrical logs.</p><p num="0003">Drilling fluids are typically classified according to their
base material. In water based muds, solid particles are
suspended in water or brine. Oil can be emulsified in the water.
Nonetheless, the water is the continuous phase. Oil based muds
are exactly the opposite. Solid particles are suspended in oil
and water or brine is emulsified in the oil and therefore the oil
is the continuous phase. The final class of drilling fluids are
pneumatic fluids in which drill cuttings are removed by a high
velocity stream of air or natural gas.</p><p num="0004">On both offshore and inland drilling barges and rigs, drill
cuttings are conveyed up the hole by a drilling fluid. Water
based drilling fluids may be suitable for drilling in certain
types of formations; however, for proper drilling in other
formations, it is desirable to use an oil base drilling fluid.
With an oil base drilling fluid, the cuttings, besides ordinarily
containing moisture, are necessarily coated with an adherent film
or layer of oily drilling fluid which may penetrate into the
interior of each cutting. This is true despite the use of
various vibrating screens, mechanical separation devices and
various chemical and washing techniques. Because of pollution to
the environment, whether on water or on land, the cuttings cannot
be properly discarded until the pollutants have been removed.</p><p num="0005">One method to accomplish the pollutant removal has been
placing the screened cuttings in a standpipe or other vessel
filled with sea water and periodically skimming off the layer of
displaced oil as it rises to the surface in the vessel. Another
method attempted is burning, i.e., oxidatively incinerating, the
oil from the cuttings. Still another method is physically
transporting the oily cuttings to a remote site for subsequent 
disposal. In each instance the method of disposal of the
cuttings has proved ineffective and inefficient.</p><p num="0006">The problems associated with the environmental compatibility
of drill cuttings, and the chemicals contained therein, has long
been recognized as a problem in the oil and gas exploration
industry. Typically the approaches for solving the environmental
compatibility problems have involved the physical treatment of
the drill cuttings, see for example U.S. Patent 4,208,285 wherein
an apparatus is provided for removing volatile materials from
drill cuttings by vaporizing the materials on the cuttings in a
non-oxidative atmosphere and U.S. Patent 4,387,514 which provides
a method and apparatus for drying oil well drill cuttings to
eliminate pollution causing organic materials from the cuttings.</p><p num="0007">It is apparent to anyone selecting or using a drilling fluid
for oil and gas exploration that an essential component of a
selected fluid is that it be properly balanced to achieve the
necessary characteristics for the specific end application. As
stated hereinabove, the typical compositions include oil based
muds, water based muds and pneumatic fluids. For purposes of
this application, only oil and water based mud systems will be
relevant. The vast majority of oil and gas exploration is done
with water based muds. The primary reason for this preference is
price and environmental compatibility. Oil based muds, while
being substantially more expensive than water based drilling
fluids, are likewise environmentally incompatible. As a result,
the use of oil based muds has been historically limited to those
situations where they are necessary.</p><p num="0008">This long felt need in the oil and gas exploration industry
for an environmentally acceptable drilling fluid which either is
an oil based drilling fluid or performs as an oil based drilling
fluid has now been achieved by applicants' invention. By use of
applicants' invention and the use of synthetic hydrocarbon<u style="single">s</u> the 
functional characteristics of an oil based drilling system are
achieved while the environmental compatibility of conventional
water based systems is attained. Such a result has until
recently been thought theoretically and practically impossible.</p><p num="0009">Various advantages of using oil based drilling mud in the
rotary drilling of boreholes in the earth have been known for
some time. In summary, it can be said that under certain
conditions, one or more of the following advantages make oil
based muds more desirable than water based muds. Lubricity
characteristics are excellent. Drilling fluid weighing less than
about 8 pounds per gallon can be prepared with an oil based mud,
and have proved advantageous in certain special drilling and
coring situations. The penetration of the formation by water is
avoided. Cores can be recovered in an in situ condition, and in
the presence of hydrous clays and bentonites, no swelling or
sloughing is experienced to reduce porosities or cause pipe
sticking difficulties. There are fewer problems with hydrophilic
shale formations drilled. Evaporite sections such as salt zones
can be drilled with minimal leaching of the salt. Furthermore,
oil based muds can be formulated to withstand temperatures up to
500 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p num="0010">The principal difficulties encountered in the use of oil
based drilling fluids are probably those of handling, fire
hazard, environmental unacceptability and the intrinsic cost per
barrel, since oil is much more expensive than water. Some
materials which heretofore have been added to oils in order to
produce satisfactory drilling muds have been of an intense black
color, e.g., carbon black and asphalt of various kinds, and
oilfield workers have a strong resistance to handling such
materials. Not just any material can be added to an oil for the
purpose of making a drilling mud, because the material to be
added must not only increase the viscosity, though not to too
great an extent, and decrease the fluid loss, but must also be 
dispersable in the oil, and above all must not be of such a
nature as to clog the formations drilled through.</p><p num="0011">In addition, oil based muds offer potential advantages;
better lubricating qualities, higher boiling points, and lower
freeze points. Because of the cost of preparing an oil mud is
always more than that of the same density water muds, the
economic justification for selecting an oil mud must come from
its superior performance under the particular conditions of use.</p><p num="0012">There is, however, strong sentiment that although the
initial differential cost of oil based muds versus aqueous based
muds favors aqueous based, as the well is drilled deeper and as
drilling operations last longer, the oil based muds actually
become more economical due to the fact that the constituents do
not have to be replenished as often and the fact that the oil
based muds are reusable for substantially longer periods of time.</p><p num="0013">As can be seen from the above, the development of a drilling
fluid that exhibits desirable characteristics of both a water
based and oil based drilling fluid has long been an unachieved
goal of the oil and gas exploration industry. With the practice
of applicants' invention this goal has been realized.</p><heading><u style="single"><b>Prior Art</b></u></heading><p num="0014">In the drilling of wells to recover hydrocarbons and gas
from subterranean deposits, it is common practice to use a rotary
drilling procedure. The drill bit cuts into the earth, causing
the cuttings to accumulate as drilling continues. The drilling
fluid is used to carry these cuttings to the surface where they
are separated and removed. The drilling fluid is recirculated
through the drill pipe at the drill bit to carry out new
cuttings. Thus, the bottom of the hole is kept clean and free of
cuttings at all times. </p><p num="0015">Although aqueous-based drilling fluids which utilize water,
brine or sea water as the primary liquid phase are dominant
throughout much of the drilling industry, various oil based
drilling fluids have been developed and are used in the field.
These oil based drilling fluids utilize hydrocarbons such as
diesel and mineral oils as the continuous phase. Normally, five
to seventy percent of the aqueous phase is emulsified in the
hydrocarbon phase utilizing suitable emulsifiers and wetting
agents in these fluids. Oil based drilling fluids are also
commonly known as oil muds. The use of oil muds is quite common
in high temperature wells and wells with troubled shale zones.</p><p num="0016">The oil muds exhibit desirable rheological properties over a
wide range of temperatures in which they are utilized. Also, oil
muds typically have excellent lubricity properties in comparison
to water based muds, which reduces sticking of the drillpipe due
to a reduction in frictional drag. Since few if any oil wells
are truly vertical there is always frictional contact between the
drill string and borehole. Frictional contact requiring excess
torque output from motors is undesirable. The lubricating
characteristics ("lubricity") of the drilling mud provides the
only known means for reducing the friction. Oil muds in general
have better lubricity than water based muds. Additionally, the
oil based muds are beneficial to shale stabilization, corrosion
inhibition, and fluid loss control.</p><p num="0017">Although oil based muds have performance characteristics
distinct from water based muds, some of which are considered
advantageous, there are various disadvantages such as cost, fire
hazard, difficulty of mixing the mud, and environmental
incompatibility effects. Among the disadvantages characteristic
of oil muds, the single overriding detrimental effect is the
environmental pollution effect associated with both onshore and
offshore drilling operations. The cleanup of accidental
discharge of oil muds in offshore environments is expensive and 
necessary due to toxicity of oil muds to aquatic life.
Currently, in the U.S., cuttings drilled using oil based muds are
required to be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable
fashion, most of which are more expensive and more inconvenient
than disposal methods for water based drilling fluids.</p><p num="0018">Such oil based drilling fluids are described, for instance,
in U.S. Patents 2,222,949, 2,316,967, 2,316,968 and 2,698,833.
These patents describe the use of non-aqueous drilling fluids
using diesel oil as the carrier or continuous phase. Several
other publications describe the use of mineral oils for low
toxicity oil muds. However, mineral oils that were once
considered to be toxicologically and environmentally superior to
diesel oil, are now also considered to be relatively toxic under
increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Several
attempts to develop modified non-polluting fluids have been made
(U.S. Patents 4,631,136; 4,830,765). These are not true
hydrocarbon fluids and require an aqueous continuous phase which
does not provide desirable functional characteristics, for
instance, shale stability derived with oil based muds.</p><p num="0019">Strict regulations are imposed by governmental regulatory
agencies especially in light of what are generally viewed as
environmental disasters involving oil spills. These regulations
have not only made the use of oil based drilling fluid more
costly but in some places difficult or impossible to use in
compliance with regulatory guidelines. Environmental concerns
have prompted the development of a new environmentally acceptable
drilling fluid. This drilling fluid is designed to be
essentially non-polluting, non-toxic and safe to aquatic life.
Pollution is usually defined as a sheen, film or discoloration of
surface water formed by drilling fluids. The U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency ("EPA") has specified a Mysid shrimp bioassay
as the means for assessing marine aquatic toxicity of drilling
fluids. A detailed account of the procedure for measuring 
toxicity of drilling fluids is described in Duke, T.W., Parrish,
P.R.; "Acute Toxicity of Eight Laboratory Prepared Generic
Drilling Fluids to Mysids (Mysidopsis Bahia)" 1984 EPA-600/3-84-067.
Such report is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p num="0020">For purposes of understanding the term "minimal toxicity"
within the context of this application it refers to an LC<sub>50</sub> of
greater than 30,000. Although 30,000 has been the number used
for purposes of evaluation it should not be considered a
limitation on the scope of this invention. Other LC<sub>50</sub> values may
be viable in various environmental settings. An LC<sub>50</sub> value of
greater than 30,000 has been equated to an "environmentally
compatible" product.</p><p num="0021">It has been known for some time that synthetic water-dispersable
polymers could be used as drilling fluid components.
In general, acrylic polymers and alkylene oxide polymers have
been described as being useful in drilling muds. See Darley and
Gray, "Composition and Properties of Drilling and Completion
Fluids," Gulf Publishing Co., Fifth Edition, pgs. 576-580.
However, no prior art disclosure mentions or appreciates the
essential molecular weight and chain length requirements of
applicants' invention. The prior art materials do not possess
the essential toxicity and environmental compatibility of
applicants' invention.</p><p num="0022">U.S. Patent No. 4,876,017 issued October 24, 1989 discloses
a synthetic hydrocarbon compound, in particular polyalphaolefin,
to be used in a water based drilling fluid as a downhole
lubricant. According to the disclosure, the resulting material
is non-toxic to marine life and does not produce a sheen on a
water surface when dumped into a body of water. The compound
also serves as a spotting fluid for the removal of lodged tools
downhole. U.S. Patent 4,876,017 does not disclose or appreciate 
that an oil based invert emulsion capable of suspending weight
materials and stable under downhole temperature and pressure
conditions can be made from synthetic hydrocarbons as described
in applicants' invention.</p><heading><u style="single"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></u></heading><p num="0023">The present invention relates to an essentially non-polluting,
substantially non-toxic drilling fluid with continuous
phase composed of synthetic hydrocarbons. The synthetic
hydrocarbons that are believed to be useful in the practice of
this invention are branched chain oligomers synthesized from one
or more olefins (unsaturated hydrocarbons) containing a C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>14</sub>
chain length and wherein the oligomers have an average molecular
weight of from 120 to 1000. In the preferred embodiments of this
invention the synthetic hydrocarbons are branched chain oligomers
synthesized from one or more olefins containing a C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>12</sub> chain
length and wherein the oligomers have an average molecular weight
of from 160 to 800. In the most preferred embodiments of this
invention the synthetic hydrocarbons are branched chain oligomers
synthesized from one or more oligomers containing a C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>10</sub>
chain length and wherein the oligomers have an average molecular
weight of 200 to 600. In each instance the synthetic hydrocarbon
mixture must have performance and viscosity characteristics that
permit functional utility as a drilling fluid or as a component
of an oil based drilling fluid. In its broadest form the
synthetic hydrocarbon mixture should have a viscosity of from 1.0
to 6.0 centistokes, preferable a viscosity of from 1.5 to 4.0
centistokes and most preferably from 1.5 to 3.5 centistokes. The
synthetic hydrocarbons of the present invention may be
hydrogenated (saturated), partially hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated.</p><p num="0024">Oils such as diesel or mineral oils produced directly or
indirectly from petroleum crude oil have traditionally been used 
as the base oils for oil based drilling fluids. These oils
contain a large variety of hydrocarbon compounds including
aromatics and straight chain paraffins. The absence of these and
the uniformity of the carbon numbers distinguish the synthetic
hydrocarbon oils of this invention from petroleum derived oils.</p><p num="0025">The synthetic hydrocarbon oils of this invention are
manufactured by oligomerizing alpha-olefins or other olefins.
The resulting oils are mixtures of branched hydrocarbon molecules
with carbon numbers that are even multiples of the base olefin.
For instance, a synthetic hydrocarbon oil made from C<sub>8</sub> olefins
contains only molecules that are C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>16</sub>, C<sub>24</sub>, C<sub>32</sub>, etc. These
oils can be hydrogenated to achieve complete saturation, or
partially hydrogenated, or left unhydrogenated. Preferably they
contain no aromatics. Since these oils are synthetic materials,
their molecular size and structure, and hence their performance
characteristics, can be controlled in a predictable and
understandable manner. It is also possible to use mixtures of
these oils and also oil synthesized from combinations of olefins.</p><p num="0026">Prior to the present invention, it was not obvious that (1)
the synthetic hydrocarbon oils would make stable invert emulsions
and that these invert emulsions could be treated to suspend
solids; (2) the suspensions would remain stable under the
temperature and pressure conditions encountered during drilling
subterranean oil and gas wells; and (3) the resulting muds would
have favorable toxicity characteristics.</p><p num="0027">The subject synthetic hydrocarbons are pure and minimally
toxic to aquatic plant and animal life. The primary embodiment
of this invention includes drilling fluids in which the synthetic
hydrocarbon oil comprises the continuous phase of an oil based
drilling fluid. </p><p num="0028">The drilling fluid compositions of this invention are
improved compositions for use offshore and onshore due to their
minimal toxicity. These compositions are stable drilling fluids
which are effective replacements for conventional oil muds.
Mysid shrimp are used in bioassay tests of laboratory prepared
drilling fluids containing the synthetic hydrocarbons and have
shown excellent survivability.</p><p num="0029">The improved drilling fluid of this invention exhibits the
functional characteristics of an oil based drilling fluid and the
environmental compatibility of most water based drilling fluids.
Specifically, the improved drilling fluid of this invention is
characterized by improved toxicity and pollution characteristics
in comparison to conventional oil based drilling fluids and
specifically improved lubricity and wellbore stability in
comparison to water based drilling fluids.</p><p num="0030">In alternate embodiments of this invention, the improved
drilling fluid can include wetting agents, viscosifiers and other
materials common to the development and formulation of drilling
fluids. As mentioned hereinabove, it is essential that the
drilling fluid that is selected and formulated for use in any
particular well application be balanced to the conditions of the
well. Therefore, although the base ingredient remains the same,
i.e., synthetic hydrocarbon, other components can be added.</p><heading><u style="single"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></u></heading><p num="0031">The drawings are supplied to illustrate the functional

AMOCO Chemical Company, product numbers #9009 and 9011; and
Chevron Chemical Company's product identified as Polymer-560;
polybutenes Indopol L-14 and H-15 offered by AMOCO Chemical
Company, as well as mixtures comprising dimeric, trimeric and
tetrameric oligomers of 1-decene from Emery, Mobil, Ethyl and
Chevron Corporations are suitable for the present invention.
These synthetic hydrocarbon oils can also be blended to achieve
the desired chemical characteristics, which are determined
according to the end use of the product.</p><p num="0035">As identified hereinbefore the synthetic hydrocarbons that
are believed to be useful in the practice of this invention are
characterized by chain length and molecular weight parameters.
Useful synthetic hydrocarbon oils consist of branched chain
oligomers synthesized from one or more olefins containing a C<sub>2</sub> to
C<sub>14</sub> chain length and wherein the oligomers have an average
molecular weight of from 120 to 1000. In the preferred
embodiments of this invention the synthetic hydrocarbons are
branched chain oligomers synthesized from one or more olefins
containing a C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>12</sub> chain length and wherein the oligomers
have an average molecular weight of from 160 to 800. In the most 
preferred embodiments of this invention the synthetic
hydrocarbons are branched chain oligomers synthesized from one or
more oligomers containing a C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>10</sub> chain length and wherein
the oligomers have an average molecular weight of 200 to 600.</p><p num="0036">In each instance the synthetic hydrocarbon mixture must have
performance and viscosity characteristics that permit functional
utility as a drilling fluid. In its broadest form the synthetic
hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon mixture should have a viscosity of
from 1.0 to 6.0 centistokes, preferable a viscosity of from 1.5
to 4.0 centistokes and most preferably from 1.5 to 3.5
centistokes. The synthetic hydrocarbons of the present invention
may be hydrogenated (saturated), partially hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated.
For safety at the wellsite the flashpoint of the
oil should exceed 150°F and preferably exceed 200°F.</p><p num="0037">The interfacial tension between oil and water is very high,
so if the liquids are mixed together they mechanically separate
immediately when the agitation ceases, to minimize the
interfacial area. Lowering the interfacial tension with a
surfactant enables one liquid to form a stable dispersion of fine
droplets in the other. The lower the interfacial tension, the
smaller the droplets and the more stable the emulsion. In most
emulsions, oil is the dispersed phase and water is the continuous
phase. However, in "invert emulsions" in which water is the
dispersed phase, a suitable emulsion can be formed upon the use
of a suitable emulsifier.</p><p num="0038">Whether an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion is formed
depends on the relative solubility of the emulsifier in the two
phases. Thus, a preferentially water soluble surfactant, such as
sodium oleate, will form an oil-in-water emulsion because it
lowers the surface tension on the water side of the oil-water
interface, and the interface curves toward the side with the 
greater surface tension, thereby forming an oil droplet enclosed
by water. On the other hand, calcium and magnesium oleates are
soluble in oil, but not in water, and thus form water-in-oil
emulsions.</p><p num="0039">An invert water-in-oil emulsion has oil as the continuous
phase. Likewise, the synthetic hydrocarbon of this invention may
comprise up to 100% by volume of the total composition. Water,
usually in the form of brine, is normally added in these
compositions. Water may be added to the drilling fluid up to a
volume of 70%,<!--footnotes removed--><!--footnotes removed--> In more preferred embodiments water is added from
5% to 65% by volume and in the most preferred embodiment water is
added from 10% to 60% by volume. These brines contain salts such
as NaCl and/or CaCl<sub>2</sub> in varying amounts ranging up to 40% by
weight.</p><p num="0040">The compositions of one embodiment of this invention require
emulsifiers to incorporate the brine or water phase into the
synthetic hydrocarbon continuous phase. Various emulsifiers are
available for this application. The emulsifiers are chemical
compounds which have both oleophilic and hydrophilic parts. The
emulsifiers that have demonstrated utility in the emulsions of
this invention are fatty acids, soaps of fatty acids, and fatty
acid derivatives including amido-amines, polyamides, polyamines,
esters (such as sorbitan monoleate polyethoxylate, sorbitan
dioleate polyethoxylate) imidazolines alcohols and combination
derivatives of the above. Blends of these materials as well as
other emulsifiers can be used for this application. Versacoat®
and Versacoat® N.S. are emulsifiers manufactured and distributed
by M-I Drilling Fluids Company.</p><p num="0041">The oil based drilling fluid compositions of this invention
may contain an additional chemical known as a wetting agent.
Various wetting agents are available and can be included in the 
compositions. The wetting agents included, but not limited to
the present invention, are fatty acids, crude tall oil, oxidized
crude tall oil, organic phosphate esters, modified imidazolines
and amido-amines, alkyl aromatic sulfates and sulfonates and the
like and combinations or derivatives of the above. Versawet® and
Versawet® NS are wetting agents manufactured and distributed by
M-I Drilling Fluids Company.</p><p num="0042">Organophilic clays, normally amine treated clays, are also
used as viscosifiers in the oil based drilling fluid composition
of the present invention. Other viscosifiers, such as oil
soluble polymers, polyamide resins, polycarboxylic acids and
soaps can also be used. The amount of viscosifier used in the
composition can vary depending upon the end use of the
composition. However, normally about 0.1% to 10% by weight range
are sufficient for most applications. VG-69 is an organoclay
material distributed by M-I Drilling Fluids Company.</p><p num="0043">The drilling fluid composition of this invention may
optionally contain a weight material. The quantity depends upon
the desired density of the final composition. The preferred
weight materials include, but are not limited to, barite, iron
oxide, calcium carbonate and the like. The weight material is
typically added to result in a drilling fluid density of up to 24
pounds per gallon, preferably up to 21 pounds per gallon and most
preferably up to 19.5 pounds per gallon.</p><p num="0044">Finally, fluid loss control agents such as modified
lignites, polymers, asphaltic compounds and the like can be added
to the drilling fluid system of this invention.</p><p num="0045">The following examples are submitted for the purpose of
illustrating the toxicity and performance characteristics of the

more than 65% of saturation. The pH of the SPP was measured and
further adjusted with 10% HCl. The definitive bioassay was
conducted using the SPP. The definitive bioassay was initiated
