The present invention relates to pyrimidine compounds that act as 5- HT receptor ligands, in particular 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor ligands, and their uses in the prevention or treatment of diseases linked to the activation of 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptors in animals.</p><p num="p0003">BACKGROUND Receptors for serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) are an important class of G protein-coupled receptors. Serotonin is thought to play a role in processes related to learning and memory, sleep, thermoregulation, mood, motor activity, pain, sexual and aggressive behaviors, appetite, neurodegenerative regulation, and biological rhythms. As expected, serotonin is linked to pathophysiological conditions such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, autism, migraine, emesis, alcoholism and neurodegenerative disorders. The serotonin receptors are currently classified into seven subfamilies</p><p num="p0004">(5-HTτ through 5-HT<sub>7</sub>). See, Hoyer, D., et al., "VII International Union of Pharmacology classification of receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine", Pharmacol. Rev., 56, 157-203 (1994). The subfamilies have been further divided into subtypes. For example, the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor is currently divided into three subtypes: 5-HT<sub>2a</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>b and 5-HT<sub>2c</sub>. The three subtypes of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors are linked to phospholipase C with the generation of two second messengers, diacylglycerol (which activates protein kinase C) and inositol trisphosphate (which releases intracellular stores of Ca<sup>2+</sup>). The 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptors have a very high density in the choroid plexus, an epithelial tissue that is the primary site of cerebrospinal fluid production. See, Sanders-Bush, E. and S.E. Mayer, "5-Hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin) Receptor agonists and

Antagonists", Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Chapter 11 , 9<sup>th</sup> Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY (1996).</p><p num="p0005">Julius, et al., isolated and characterized the 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor and later reported that transgenic mice lacking the 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor exhibit seizures and an eating disorder resulting in increased consumption of food (see, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,985,352 and 5,698,766, respectively). Consequently, compounds selective for the 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor may provide useful therapies for the treatment of seizure and eating disorders without the side effects typically associated with nonselectivity of the ligand. Several compounds have been proposed as 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor agonists or antagonists for use in the treatment of obesity and other related diseases associated with decreased neurotransmission of serotonin in mammals. See, e.g., EP 863136 (azetidine and pyrrolidine derivatives); EP 657426 (tricyclic pyrrole derivatives); EP 655440 (substituted 1 -aminoethyl indoles); EP 572863 (pyrazinoindole derivatives); WO98/030548 (aminoalkylindazole compounds); WO 98/56768 (tricyclic pyrrole and pyrazole derivatives); WO 99/43647 (azetidine and pyrrolidine derivatives); WO 99/58490 (aryl- hydronaphthalenalkana ine derivatives); WO 00/12475 (indoline derivatives); WO 00/12482 (indazole derivatives); WO 00/12502 (pyrroloquinoline derivatives); WO 00/12510 (pyrroloindole, pyridoindole and azepinoindole derivatives); WO 00/28993 (naphthylacetylpiperazine derivatives); WO 00/44737 (aminoalkylbenzofuran derivatives); and WO 00/76984 (2,3- disubstituted pyrazines).</p><p num="p0006">The non-selectivity of ligands for the various 5-HT receptors remains a challenge. It is suspected that the non-selectivity of some ligands contributes to various adverse side effects such as hallucinations and cardiovascular complications. Therefore, there remains a need for selective 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor ligands.

<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
π-propyl, /-propyl, n-butyl, /-butyl, s-butyl, f-butyl, and other constitutional isomers containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms (including stereoisomers). The alkane radical may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents. For example, a "halo-substituted alkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted with one or more halogen atoms (e.g., fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, perfluoroethyl, chloromethyl, bromomethyl, and the like). Similarly, the alkyl portion of an alkoxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino, or alkylthio group has the same meaning as alkyl defined above and the halo-substituted alkyl portion of a halo-substituted alkoxy, alkyl amino, dialkylamino or alkylthio group has the same meaning as halo- substituted alkyl defined above.</p><p num="p0061">The term "partially or fully saturated cycloalkyl" refers to nonaromatic rings that are either partially or fully hydrogenated.

Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a significant clinical problem, which can affect both males and females. The causes of SD may be both organic as well as psychological. Organic aspects of SD are typically caused by underlying vascular diseases, such as those associated with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, by prescription medication and/or by psychiatric disease such as depression. Physiological factors include fear, performance anxiety and interpersonal conflict. SD impairs sexual performance, diminishes self- esteem and disrupts personal relationships thereby inducing personal distress. In the clinic, SD disorders have been divided into female sexual dysfunction (FSD) disorders and male sexual dysfunction (MSD) disorders (Melman et al 1999). FSD is best defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression. Male sexual dysfunction (MSD) is generally associated with erectile dysfunction, also known as male erectile dysfunction (MED) (Benet et al 1994 - Male Erectile dysfunction assessment and treatment options. Comp. Ther. 20: 669-673.).</p><p num="p0117">The compounds of the invention are particularly beneficial for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of sexual dysfunction in the male (e.g. male 
<!-- EPO <DP n="36"/>-->
erectile dysfunction - MED) and in the female - female sexual dysfunction (FSD), e.g. female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD).</p><p num="p0118">It is known that some individuals can suffer from male erectile dysfunction (MED). MED is defined as: "the inability to achieve and/or maintain a penile erection for satisfactory sexual performance" (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Impotence, 1993)"</p><p num="p0119">It has been estimated that the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) of all degrees (minimal, moderate and complete impotence) is 52% in men 40 to 70 years old, with higher rates in those older than 70 (Melman,A. &amp; Gingell, J.C. (1999). The epidemiology and pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction. J. Urology 161 : 5-11). The condition has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient and their partner, often resulting in increased anxiety and tension which leads to depression and low self esteem. Whereas two decades ago, MED was primarily considered to be a psychological disorder (Benet, A.E. et al (1994), Male erectile dysfunction assessment and treatment options. Comp. Ther. 20: 669-673), it is now known that for the majority of patients there is an underlying organic cause. As a result, much progress has been made in identifying the mechanism of normal penile erection and the pathophysiology of MED. Penile erection is a haemodynamic event which is dependent upon the balance of contraction and relaxation of the corpus cavemosal smooth muscle and vasculature of the penis (Lerner, S.E. et a/ (1993). A review of erectile dysfunction: new insights and more questions. J. Urology 149: 1246-1255). Corpus cavernosal smooth muscle is also referred to herein as corporal smooth muscle or in the plural sense corpus cavernosa. Relaxation of the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle leads to an increased blood flow into the trabecular spaces of the corpus cavernosa, causing them to expand against the surrounding tunica and compress the draining veins. This produces a vast elevation in blood pressure which results in an erection (Naylor, A.M. (1998). Endogenous neurotransmitters mediating penile erection. Br. J. Urology 81 : 424-431). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="37"/>-->
 The changes that occur during the erectile process are complex and require a high degree of coordinated control involving the peripheral and central nervous systems, and the endocrine system (Naylor, 1998). Corporal smooth muscle contraction is modulated by sympathetic noradrenergic innervation via activation of postsynaptic α-i adrenoceptors. MED may be associated with an increase in the endogenous smooth muscle tone of the corpus cavemosum. However, the process of corporal smooth muscle relaxation is mediated partly by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) neurotransmission. There are a number of other NANC neurotransmitters found in the penis, other than NO, such as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The main relaxing factor responsible for mediating this relaxation is nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Taub, H.C. et a/ (1993). Relationship between contraction and relaxation in human and rabbit corpus cavemosum. Urology 42: 698-704). It is thought that reducing corporal smooth muscle tone may aid NO to induce relaxation of the corpus cavemosum. During sexual arousal in the male, NO is released from neurones and the endothelium and binds to and activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) located in the smooth muscle cells and endothelium, leading to an elevation in intracellular cyclic guanosine 3',5'- monophosphate (cGMP) levels. This rise in cGMP leads to a relaxation of the corpus cavemosum due to a reduction in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]ι), via unknown mechanisms thought to involve protein kinase G activation (possibly due to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps and Ca<sup>2+</sup>- activated K<sup>+</sup> channels).</p><p num="p0120">The categories of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) are best defined by contrasting them to the phases of normal female sexual response: desire, arousal and orgasm (see S R Leiblum, (1998), Definition and Classification of Female Sexual Disorders, Int. J. Impotence Res., 10, S104-S106). Desire or libido is the drive for sexual expression. Its manifestations often include sexual thoughts either when in the company of an interested partner or when 
<!-- EPO <DP n="38"/>-->
exposed to other erotic stimuli. Arousal includes the vascular response to sexual stimulation, an important component of which is genital engorgement and increased vaginal lubrication, elongation of the vagina and increased genital sensation/sensitivity and a subjective excitement response. Orgasm is the release of sexual tension that has culminated during arousal. Hence, FSD occurs when a woman has an absent, inadequate or unsatisfactory response in any one or more of these phases, usually desire, arousal or orgasm.</p><p num="p0121">The American Psychiatric Association classifies female sexual dysfunction (FSD) into four classes: FSAD, hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female orgasmic disorder (FOD), and sexual pain disorders (e.g. dyspareunia and vaginismus) [see the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)]. DSM-IV defines the four classes as follows:</p><p num="p0122">HSDD - Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgment of deficiency or absence is made by the clinician, taking into account factors that affect functioning, such as age and the context of the persons life. FSAD - Persistent or recurrent inability to attain, or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement.</p><p num="p0123">FOD - Persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase. Women exhibit wide variability in the type or intensity of stimulation that triggers orgasm. The diagnosis of FOD should be based on the clinician's judgment that the woman's orgasmic capacity is less than would be reasonable for her age, sexual experience, and the adequacy of the sexual stimulation she receives.</p><p num="p0124">Sexual Pain Disorders such as Dyspareunia and Vaginismus. Dysparenuia - Recurrent or persistent genital pain associated with sexual intercourse. Vaginismus - Recurrent or persistent involuntary spasm of the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="39"/>-->
musculature of the outer third of the vagina that interferes with sexual intercourse.</p><p num="p0125">HSDD is present if a woman has no or little desire to be sexual, and has no or few sexual thoughts or fantasies. This type of FSD can be caused by low testosterone levels, due either to natural menopause or to surgical menopause. Other causes in both pre-menopausal woman (i.e. woman who are pre-menopausal and who have not have hysterectomies) as well as post-menopausal women include illness, medications, fatigue, depression and/or anxiety. Factors having a potential (conscious or sub-conscious) psychological impact such as relationship difficulties or religious factors may be related to the presence of/development of HSDD in females. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV of the American Psychiatric Association defines Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) as being: "... a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement. The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. ...".</p><p num="p0126">The arousal response consists of vasocongestion in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia. The disturbance causes marked distress and/or interpersonal difficulty. FSAD is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting pre-, peri- and post-menopausal (± hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) women. It is associated with concomitant disorders such as depression, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and urogenital (UG) disorders. The primary consequences of FSAD are lack of engorgement/swelling, lack of lubrication and lack of pleasurable genital sensation. The secondary consequences of FSAD are reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving an orgasm. It has recently been hypothesized that there is a vascular basis for at least a proportion of patients with symptoms of FSAD (Goldstein er a/., Int. J. Impot. Res.. 10, S84-S90,1998) with animal data supporting this view (Park et al., Int. J. Impot. Res.. 9, 27-37, 1997). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="40"/>-->
 Drug candidates for treating FSAD, which are under investigation for efficacy, are primarily erectile dysfunction therapies that promote circulation to male genitalia. They consist of two types of formulation, oral or sublingual medications (Apomorphine, Phentolamine, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, e.g. Sildenafil), and prostaglandin (PGEi) that are injected or administered trans ureth rally in men and topically to the genitalia in women.</p><p num="p0127">The compounds of the present invention are advantageous by providing a means for restoring a normal sexual arousal response - namely increased genital blood flow leading to vaginal, clitoral and labial engorgement. This will result in increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance and increased genital sensitivity. Hence, the present invention provides a means to restore, or potentiate, the normal sexual arousal response. By female genitalia herein we mean: "The genital organs consist of an internal and external group. The internal organs are situated within the pelvis and consist of ovaries, the uterine tubes, uterus and the vagina. The external organs are superficial to the urogenital diaphragm and below the pelvic arch. They comprise the mons pubis, the labia majora and minora pudendi, the clitoris, the vestibule, the bulb of the vestibule, and the greater vestibular glands" (Gray's Anatomy, CD. Clemente, 13<sup>th</sup> American Edition). R.J. Levin teaches us that because "... male and female genitalia develop embryologically from the common tissue anlagen, [that] male and female genital structures are argued to be homologues of one another. Thus the clitoris is the penile homologue and the labia homologues of the scrotal sac. ..." (Levin, R.J. (1991), Exp. Clin. Endocrinol.. 98, 61-69).</p><p num="p0128">In summary, FSAD is characterized by inadequate genital response to sexual stimulation. The genitalia do not undergo the engorgement that characterizes normal sexual arousal. The vaginal walls are poorly lubricated, so that intercourse is painful. Orgasms may be impeded. Arousal disorder can be caused by reduced oestrogen at menopause or 
<!-- EPO <DP n="41"/>-->
after childbirth and during lactation, as well as by illnesses, with vascular components such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Other causes result from treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or antihypertensive agents. FOD is the persistent or recurrent difficulty, delay in or absence of attaining orgasm following sufficient sexual stimulation and arousal, which causes personal distress.</p><p num="p0129">Sexual pain disorders (includes dyspareunia and vaginismus) are characterized by pain resulting from penetration and sexual activity and may be caused by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.</p> <p num="p0130">According to a further aspect, the present invention additionally provides a method for the treatment and/or prevention of male sexual dysfunction (MSD), in particular male erectile dysfunction (MED) via treatment with a compound of the present invention as detailed hereinbefore.</p><p num="p0131">According to a yet further aspect, the present invention additionally provides a method for the treatment and/or prevention of male sexual dysfunction via treatment with a combination of a compound of the present invention as defined hereinbefore and one or more compounds which inhibit the activity of PDE, in particular compounds which inhibit the activity of cGMP PDE5, and/or one or more compounds which inhibit the activity of NEP.</p><p num="p0132">Men who display an insufficient response or lack of response to treatment with Viagra™ may benefit either from therapy based on treatment with compounds of the present invention alone or via combination therapy based on compound(s) of the present invention and a cGMP PDE5i, such as for example sildenafil.

The incision was about 5cm in length just above the pubis. The fat and muscle was bluntly dissected away to reveal the hypogastric nerve which runs down the body cavity. It was essential to keep close to the side curve of the pubis wall in order to avoid damaging the femoral vein and artery which lie above the pubis. The sciatic and pelvic nerves lie deeper and were located after further dissection on the dorsal side of the rabbit. Once the sciatic nerve is identified, the pelvic nerve was easily located. The term pelvic nerve is loosely applied; anatomy books on the subject fail to identify the nerves in sufficient detail. However, stimulation of the nerve causes an increase in intracavernosal pressure and cavernosal blood flow, and innervation of the pelvic region. The pelvic nerve was freed away from surrounding tissue and a Harvard bipolar stimulating electrode was placed around the nerve. The nerve was slightly lifted to give some tension, then the electrode was secured in position. Approximately 1 ml of light paraffin oil was placed around the nerve and electrode. This acts as a protective lubricant to the nerve and prevents blood contamination of the electrode. The electrode was connected to a Grass S88 Stimulator. The pelvic nerve was stimulated using the following parameters:- 5V, pulse width 0.5ms, duration of stimulus 20 seconds with a frequency of 16Hz. Reproducible responses were obtained when the nerve was stimulated every 15-20 minutes. Several stimulations using the above parameters were performed to establish a mean control response.

changes such as vaginal, labial and clitoral engorgement result from increases in genital blood flow. Engorgement leads to increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance (relaxation of vaginal smooth muscle) and increases in vaginal and clitoral sensitivity. Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting up to 40% of pre-, peri- and postmenopausal (±HRT) women. The primary consequence of FSAD is reduced genital engorgement or swelling which manifests itself as a lack of vaginal lubrication and a lack of pleasurable genital sensation. Secondary consequences include reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving orgasm. The most common cause of FSAD is decreased genital blood flow resulting in reduced vaginal, labial and clitoral engorgement (Berman, J., Goldstein, I., Werbin, T. et al. (1999a).

This arterial catheter was linked to a Gould system to record blood pressure. Samples for blood gas analysis were also taken via the arterial catheter. Systolic and diastolic pressures were measured, and the mean arterial pressure calculated using the formula (diastolic x2 + systolic) ÷3. Heart rate was measured via the pulse oxymeter and Po-ne-mah data acquisition software system (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc). A ventral midline incision was made into the abdominal cavity. The incision was about 5cm in length just above the pubis. The fat and muscle was bluntly dissected away to reveal the hypogastric nerve which runs down the body cavity. It was essential to keep close to the side curve of the pubis wall in order to avoid damaging the femoral vein and artery, which lie above the pubis. The sciatic and pelvic nerves lie deeper and were located after further dissection on the dorsal side of the rabbit. Once the sciatic nerve is identified, the pelvic nerve was easily located. The term pelvic nerve is loosely applied; anatomy books on the subject fail to identify the nerves in sufficient detail. However, stimulation of the nerve causes an increase in vaginal and clitoral blood flow, and innervation of the pelvic region. The pelvic nerve was freed away from surrounding tissue and a Harvard bipolar 
<!-- EPO <DP n="86"/>-->
stimulating electrode was placed around the nerve. The nerve was slightly lifted to give some tension, then the electrode was secured in position. Approximately 1ml of light paraffin oil was placed around the nerve and electrode. This acts as a protective lubricant to the nerve and prevents blood contamination of the electrode. The electrode was connected to a Grass S88 Stimulator. The pelvic nerve was stimulated using the following parameters:- 5V, pulse width 0.5ms, duration of stimulus 10 seconds and a frequency range of 2 to 16Hz. Reproducible responses were obtained when the nerve was stimulated every 15-20 minutes. A frequency response curve was determined at the start of each experiment in order to determine the optimum frequency to use as a sub-maximal response, normally 4Hz. A ventral midline incision was made, at the caudal end of the pubis, to expose the pubic area. Connective tissue was removed to expose the tunica of the clitoris, ensuring that the wall was free from small blood vessels. The external vaginal wall was also exposed by removing any connective tissue. One laser Doppler flow probe was inserted 3cm into the vagina, so that half the probe shaft was still visible. A second probe was positioned so that it lay just above the external clitoral wall. The position of these probes was then adjusted until a signal was obtained. A second probe was placed just above the surface of a blood vessel on the external vaginal wall. Both probes were clamped in position.</p><p num="p0320">Test Compounds: 8,9-dichloro-2,3,4,4a-tetrahydro-1 H-pyrazino[1 ,2-a]quinoxalin-5(6H)- one, which corresponds to Compound 75 of Chaki and Nakazato - Expert Opin.

 Data recordal Vaginal and clitoral blood flow was recorded either as numbers directly from the Flowmeter using Po-ne-mah data acquisition software (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc), or indirectly from Gould chart recorder trace. Calibration was set at the beginning of the experiment (0-125ml/min/100g tissue).AII data are reported as mean + standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Significant changes were identified using Student's t-tests.</p><p num="p0322">Results The serotonin 5HT2C receptor agonist (8,9-dichloro-2,3,4,4a- tetrahydro-1 H-pyrazino[1 ,2-a]quinoxalin-5(6H)-one; 5mg/kg s.c.) acts as a potent enhancer of pelvic-nerve stimulated (PNS) increases in vaginal and clitoral blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit (see Table 8 below). The potentiation was significant 30mins after s.c. dosing and remained elevated for circa 1 hr. The 5HT2c agonist had no effect on basal genital blood flow in the absence of PNS (see Table 8 below). This reinforces our view that a 5HT2c receptor agonist will enhance the arousal response by potentiating the mechanism(s) that control sexual arousal/genital blood flow, thereby treating FSAD, and will not induce arousal in the absence of sexual stimulation. Since these agents also enhance clitoral blood flow it is likely that they will be effective in the treatment of orgasmic disorders.</p><p num="p0323">Table 8 below illustrates that 8,9-dichloro-2,3,4,4a-tetrahydro-1 H- pyrazino[1 ,2-a]quinoxalin-5(6H)-one (5mg/kg s.c.) potentiates pelvic nerve stimulated increases in genital blood flow circa 35% after subcutaneous administration in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal.
