"A Microfluidic Device and Manufacture Thereof" filed on June 4, 2002 and accorded
serial number 10/163,215, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading><p num="0002">The present invention is generally related to glass compositions and, more
particularly, is related to borosilicate glass compositions and uses thereof.</p><heading><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0003">"Pyrex™ like" glass (borosilicate glass) is a well-known glass that has a low
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) 33 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C and high chemical durability (<i>i.e.</i>,
resistance to acidic and alkaline reagents). As a result, Pyrex glass has become an
important component in many types of laboratory equipment that require chemical
durability.</p><p num="0004">However, powdered Pyrex™ glass (frit) is not as important because it undergoes
devitrification (<i>i.e.</i>, formation of cristobalite, tridymite, and/or quartz crystals that lead
to a decrease in glass properties) during sintering at between about 700-800°C. Crystal
formation with high CTE lowers the mechanical strength of the sintered glass product.
Lower mechanical strength is also due to the volume change associated with the phase
transformation from an amorphous state to the crystal state. Thus, when powdered 
Pyrex™ glass is used to make frit layers on a substrate having a low CTE,
devitrification increases global CTE of the frit layer and thereby causes cracks to form.</p><p num="0005">One potential solution to overcome devitrification in powdered Pyrex™ glass is
to add an inhibitor oxide such as alumina to the powdered Pyrex™ glass. The addition
of the alumina tends to inhibit the formation of high expansion crystals. The addition
of alumina, however, causes the sintering ability of the frit glass to decrease. In
addition, the fluidity of the frit glass is decreased during sintering when alumina has
been added.</p><p num="0006">Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to form a glass frit
that addresses the aforementioned deficiencies and/or inadequacies.</p><heading><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0007">A representative borosilicate glass includes a borosilicate glass composition.
The borosilicate glass composition includes silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in a range from
about 60% to 74% by total composition weight; boric oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from
about 9% to 25% by total composition weight; aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from
about 7% to 17% by total composition weight; and at least one alkali oxide in a range
from about 2% to 7% by total composition weight. In addition, the borosilicate glass
has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is in a range between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C
and 55 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C. Furthermore, the borosilicate glass composition resists
devitrification upon sintering without the addition of an inhibitor oxide.</p><p num="0008">A representative method of making a borosilicate glass includes forming a
homogeneous mixture by mixing a plurality of components. The components of the
homogeneous mixture include silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in a range from about 60% to 74%
by total composition weight, boric oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from about 9% to 25% by
total composition weight, aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from about 7% to 17% by
total composition weight, and at least one alkali oxide in a range from about 2% to 7%
by total composition weight. Next the method includes melting the homogeneous
mixture; and sintering the homogeneous mixture forming a borosilicate glass. The
borosilicate glass has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is in a range
between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C and 55 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C. In addition, the homogeneous mixture
resists devitrification upon sintering without the addition of an inhibitor oxide. </p><p num="0009">A representative microfluidic device includes a first assembly and a second
assembly. The first assembly includes a microstructure that is disposed on a first
substrate. The second assembly includes a second substrate and a precursor material.
The second assembly and the first assembly are positioned such that the precursor
material and the microstructure are adjacent one another. The second assembly is
positioned on the microstructure after the first assembly is presintered and adhered
thereto by heat treatment to form a one-piece microstructure defining at least one recess
between the first and second assemblies. The precursor material includes silicon
dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in a range from about 60% to 74% by total composition weight; boric
oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from about 9% to 25% by total composition weight; aluminum
oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from about 7% to 17% by total composition weight; and at
least one alkali oxide in a range from about 2% to 7% by total composition weight. In
addition, the precursor material has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is in a
range between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C and 55 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C. Further, the precursor material
resists devitrification upon sintering without the addition of an inhibitor oxide.</p><p num="0010">A representative method of fabricating a microfluidic device includes providing
a first assembly and a second assembly. The first assembly includes a microstructure
that is disposed on a first substrate. The second assembly includes a second substrate
and a precursor material. The precursor material includes a borosilicate glass
composition that has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is in a range
between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C and 55 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C. In addition, the borosilicate glass
composition resists devitrification upon sintering without the addition of an inhibitor
oxide. The precursor material includes silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in a range from about
60% to 74% by total composition weight; boric oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from about 9%
to 25% by total composition weight; aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in a range from about 7%
to 17% by total composition weight; and at least one alkali oxide in a range from about
2% to 7% by total composition weight. In addition, the precursor material has a
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is in a range between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C
and 55 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C. Further, the precursor material resists devitrification upon sintering
without the addition of an inhibitor oxide. The method also includes disposing the first
assembly on the second assembly such that the precursor material and the
microstructure are adjacent one another and heating the first assembly and the second 
assembly to form a one-piece microstructure defining at least one recess between the
first and second assemblies.</p><p num="0011">Other compositions, systems, methods, devices, features, and advantages of the
present invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon
examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all
such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this
description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the
accompanying claims.</p><heading><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p num="0012">Many aspects of the invention can be better understood with reference to the
following drawings. The components in the drawings are not necessarily to scale,
emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the present
invention. Moreover, in the drawings, like reference numerals designate corresponding
parts throughout the several views.</p><p num="0013">FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view that illustrates an exemplary microfluidic device
that includes the borosilicate glass composition of the present invention.</p><p num="0014">FIGS. 2A' through 2E illustrate cross-sectional views of an exemplary
fabrication process of the microfluidic device illustrated in FIG. 1.</p><heading><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b></heading><p num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention provide for borosilicate glass
compositions, methods of preparation thereof, and structures incorporating borosilicate
glass formed from the borosilicate glass compositions. Embodiments of the present
invention overcome at least some of the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies
described above by providing borosilicate glass compositions that self-inhibit the
formation of detrimental crystals. As discussed above, formation of one or more of
these crystals may likely cause an increase in the coefficient of thermal expansion
(CTE). Consequently, the glass product loses mechanical strength due, at least in part,
to the volume change associated with crystal formation. </p><p num="0016">In addition, the borosilicate glass compositions may be formulated to resist
thermal shock, be chemically resistant to acidic and alkaline chemical reagents, and
have low softening points, while not devitrifying and causing crystals.</p><p num="0017">In particular, a glass formed from an embodiment of the borosilicate glass
composition preferably has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is in a range
between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C and 55 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C. In addition, the borosilicate glass
composition preferably resists devitrification upon sintering without the addition of an
inhibitor oxide (<i>i.e.</i>, alumina powder), as discussed above, which decreases sintering
ability and fluidity of the borosilicate glass composition during sintering.</p><p num="0018">Embodiments of the borosilicate glass composition include, among others,
silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), boric oxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and at least one
alkali oxide. The alkali oxide may preferably include lithium oxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O), potassium
oxide (K<sub>2</sub>O), and sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>O). Not intending to be bound by theory, it
appears that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> plays a role in inhibiting the formation of cristobalite and tridymite
crystals during the sintering of the borosilicate glass composition. In addition, it
appears that B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> increases the meltability of the borosilicate glass composition and
acts as an efficient flux without significantly increasing the CTE of the borosilicate
glass, while the alkali oxide increases the CTE of the borosilicate glass.</p><p num="0019">It is also possible to add conventional finishing agents such as As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
fluorides, bromides, or chlorides, with the provision that their total content does not
exceed approximately 1%. If desired, bleaching agents may be added. It is also possible
to color the glass by adding conventional coloring elements.</p><p num="0020">In particular, one embodiment of the borosilicate glass composition includes
SiO<sub>2</sub> in a range between about 60% and 74% by total composition weight, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in a
range between about 9% and 25% by total composition weight, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in a range
between about 7% and 17% by total composition weight, and the at least one alkali
oxide in a range between about 2% and 7% by total composition weight.</p><p num="0021">In addition, the borosilicate glass composition may include one or more
alkaline-earth oxides. The alkaline-earth oxides include barium oxide (BaO), strontium
oxide (SrO), calcium oxide (CaO), and magnesium (MgO). Furthermore, the
borosilicate glass composition may include one or more rare-earth oxides such as, but
not limited to, lanthanum oxide (La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), yttirium oxide 
(Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>). The sum of the weight percentages of the alkaline-earth
oxides and/or the rare-earth oxides is in a range between about 0.1% and 7% by
total composition weight. Again, not intending to be bound by theory, it appears the
alkaline-earth oxide increases the CTE of a borosilicate glass formed from the
borosilicate glass composition.</p><p num="0022">Furthermore, the borosilicate glass composition may also include zirconium
oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) in the range between about 0.1% and 5% by total composition weight.
Not intending to be bound by theory, addition of the ZrO<sub>2</sub> to the borosilicate glass
composition appears to enhance resistance to alkaline reagents.</p><p num="0023">In another embodiment the borosilicate glass composition preferably includes
SiO<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and ZrO<sub>2</sub>. Not intending to be bound by theory, it appears
that Na<sub>2</sub>O and/or K<sub>2</sub>O can increase the likelihood of and extent of devitrification and
are therefore not included in this embodiment. In addition, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is included to increase
melt ability, stability, and reduce glass viscosity, and Li<sub>2</sub>O increases melt ability, lowers
glass viscosity, and also increases CTE. In particular, adding Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to the borosilicate
glass composition causes substitution of Si<sup>4+</sup> with Al<sup>3+</sup> in the atomic glass network.
Consequently, Li<sup>+</sup> is strongly bonded to the glass network because of the strong
coupling between Li<sup>+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup>, which occurs from a need to maintain electroneutrality
at the local atomic level. The strong bond of Li<sup>+</sup> to the glass network enhances the
acidic resistance of the borosilicate glass composition. Addition of the ZrO<sub>2</sub> to the
borosilicate glass composition appears to enhance alkali resistance.</p><p num="0024">This embodiment of the borosilicate glass composition can be used to from a
glass that has a CTE in a range between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C and 45 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C upon
sintering. The borosilicate glass formed from the borosilicate glass composition has a
softening point in a range between about 600 and 1000°C. In addition, the borosilicate
glass has a percent weight loss of less than about 10 milligrams/dm<sup>2</sup> according to the
DIN 12116 acid resistance test (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., determining the percent weight loss after placing
the borosilicate glass in a boiling aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid 6N for 6 hours).
Furthermore, the borosilicate glass has a percent weight loss of less than about 250
milligrams/dm<sup>2</sup> according to the ISO 695 alkali resistance test (<i>i.e.</i>, determining the
percent weight loss after placing the borosilicate glass in a boiling aqueous solution of
mixed alkali for 3 hours). </p><p num="0025">In particular, the borosilicate glass composition includes SiO<sub>2</sub> in the range
between about 68% and 73% by total composition weight, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the range between
about 13% and 17% by total composition weight, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the range between about 8%
and 15% by total composition weight, Li<sub>2</sub>O in the range between about 2% and 5% by
total composition weight, and ZrO<sub>2</sub> in the range between about 1% and 3% by total
composition weight. In addition, the sum of the weight percent of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and
ZrO<sub>2</sub> in the borosilicate glass composition is less than 78% by total composition weight.</p><p num="0026">The method of forming borosilicate glass composition includes forming a
homogeneous mixture of the components of the borosilicate glass composition
described above. The homogeneous mixture is then melted at a temperature of about
1650 ± 10°C in a platinum-rhodium crucible or the like, which may take from about 5
to 10 hours. After the homogeneous mixture is melted, the melted composition is
quenched into deionized water and then milled in dry conditions using an alumina ball
mill or the like into borosilicate frit particles. Then sieved particles are disposed into a
mold (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., silicon mold) and sintered at a temperature about 20°C above the softening
point of the borosilicate glass (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., about 850°C) for about 20 to 40 minutes.</p><p num="0027">Table 1 includes three (Compositions 1-3) representative borosilicate glass
compositions, the Pyrex™ glass chemical composition, and two (Compositions A and
B) other glass compositions. In addition, glass properties (<i>e.g.</i>, bulk glass CTE,
softening point, DIN 12116 acid resistance test, and ISO 695 alkali resistance test) and
glass powder properties (<i>e.g.</i>, sintered glass CTE and crystalline phase) were measured
for each composition listed above and are included in Table 1 for comparative
purposes. As can be seen from Table 1, Compositions 1-3 have CTE's (sintered glass)
and softening points less than the Pyrex™ glass compositions. In addition,
Compositions 2 and 3 have comparable chemical resistances to that of the Pyrex™
chemical compositions. Compositions 1-3 do not form cristobalite crystalline phases,
while the Pyrex™ chemical compositions and Compositions A and B form cristabalite
crystalline phases. Thus, Compositions 1-3 have physical characteristics superior to

compositions can be used in microfluidic devices as precursor materials that may
enhance the contact between components of the microfluidic device (<i>i.e.</i>, a substrate
and a microstructure). The borosilicate glass formed from the borosilicate glass
composition has a CTE that is compatible with the CTE of the other components of the
microfluidic device upon sintering. The compatible CTEs allow fabrication and use
without mechanical stresses. In addition, the borosilicate glass composition may be
formulated so that the borosilicate glass formed from the borosilicate glass composition
is chemically resistant to chemical reagents (<i>i.e.</i>, acidic and/or alkaline chemical
reagents) that may be used during the operation of the microfluidic device.</p><p num="0029">Reference will now be made to the figures. FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a
representative microfluidic device 10 that incorporates a borosilicate glass composition 
of the present invention. The microfluidic device 10 includes a first substrate 11, a
microstructure 13, a precursor material 15, and a second substrate 17. The
microstructure 13 is disposed between the first substrate 11 and the precursor material
15. The precursor material 15 is disposed on the second substrate 17 adjacent the
microstructure 13.</p><p num="0030">The first substrate 11, the microstructure 13, and second substrate 17 can be
made of materials such as, but not limited to glasses, glass ceramics, ceramics, metals,
semiconductors, or combinations thereof. The first substrate 11, the microstructure 13,
and the second substrate 17 can be constructed of the same or of different materials.</p><p num="0031">The first substrate 11, the microstructure 13, the precursor material 15, and the
second substrate 17 can be combined to form recesses bounded by the microstructure
13 and the precursor material 15. The recesses can have various cross-sectional
dimensions such as, but not limited to, substantially square, substantially rectangular,
substantially hexagonal, semicircular, or substantially circular. For example, FIG. 1
shows the recesses to be substantially square.</p><p num="0032">In addition, the total volume of the recesses can vary depending on the particular
application. The degree of perforation (<i>i.e.</i>, the empty space between the ridges of the
microstructure 13) of the microstructure 13 determines the total volume. The preferred
embodiment of the microstructure 13 includes a microstructure that is highly perforated
so that the total volume of the recesses is large. For example, the percentage of empty
space bounded by the microstructure 13 and the precursor material 15 is typically
greater than about 50%. However, lower volume percentages are contemplated and are
within the scope of the present invention.</p><p num="0033">In particular, the first substrate 11 and the second substrate 17 have a thickness
in the range of about 200 µm to about 3 millimeters (mm), and preferable at least

300 µm and a height of up to approximately 800 µm; the widths of the resulting
recesses are in the range of about 50 µm to more than about 1000 µm.</p><p num="0034">As depicted in FIG. 1, the walls of the microstructure 13 that form the recesses
can have a constant thickness. However, the thickness of the wall may be constant,
tapered, flaring, or a combination thereof and can be tailored for a particular
application. </p><p num="0035">Embodiments of the microfluidic device 10 can include at least one porous
structure (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., first substrate 11, second substrate 17, and/or a microstructure 13). The
porous structure may be used to perform separations within the microfluidic device 10.
In addition, a porous structure can be used to affix a catalyst thereto, as discussed
below.</p><p num="0036">In general, the microfluidic device 10 may include appropriate passages (not
shown) for inlet and outlet of one or more fluids that flow within the microfluidic
device 10. The inlet/outlet can be formed through the first substrate 11, the second
substrate 17, and/or the microstructure 13.</p><p num="0037">The precursor material 15 can be made of the borosilicate glass compositions
described above. The preferred embodiment of the precursor material 15 includes SiO<sub>2</sub>,

glass that has a CTE in a range between about 30 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C and 45 x 10<sup>-7</sup>/°C
upon sintering. In addition, the borosilicate glass formed from the borosilicate glass
composition preferably has a softening point in a range between about 600 and 1000°C.
Further, the borosilicate glass preferably has a percent weight loss of less than 10
milligrams/dm<sup>2</sup> according to the DIN 12116 acid resistance test as described above.
Furthermore, the borosilicate glass preferably exhibits a percent weight loss of less than
250 milligrams/dm<sup>2</sup> according to the ISO 695 alkali resistance test as described above.</p><p num="0038">In particular, the precursor material 15 includes a borosilicate glass composition
having SiO<sub>2</sub> in the range between about 68% and 73% by total composition weight,
B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the range between about 13% and 17% by total composition weight, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in
the range between about 8% and 15% by total composition weight, Li<sub>2</sub>O in the range
between about 2% and 5% by total composition weight, and ZrO<sub>2</sub> in the range between
about 1% and 3% by total composition weight. In addition, the sum of the weight
percent of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and ZrO<sub>2</sub> in the precursor material 15 is less than about 78% by
total composition weight.</p><p num="0039">In another embodiment, the precursor material 15 includes an organic medium
such as, but not limited to, a thermoplastic medium, a thermosetting medium, or a
photopolymerizable medium. The organic medium is added to the precursor material
15 to assist in vacuum molding of the precursor material 15. Subsequently, the organic 
medium present in the precursor material 15 is substantially eliminated during pre-sintering
and sintering.</p><p num="0040">In general, the CTE of the first substrate 11, the microstructure 13, the precursor
material 15, and the second substrate 17 are compatible to prevent mechanical stresses
in the microfluidic device 10 during fabrication and use. In addition, the materials of
the first substrate 11, the microstructure 13, the precursor material 15, and the second
substrate 17 can be selected to be chemically resistant to chemical reagents (<i>i.e.</i>, acidic
and/or alkaline chemical reagents) that may be used during the operation of the
microfluidic device 10.</p><p num="0041">Within the microfluidic device 10, fluids involved in the experiment/test may
come into contact only with surfaces of the microfluidic device 10, which are under
complete control. In this regard, the surfaces of the microfluidic device 10 can be
modified to be active or passive. For example, the surface can include a catalyst or the
surface can be covered with a film (<i>e.g.</i>, polysiloxane) to make the surface neutral. In
addition, the microfluidic device 10 may include electrical conductors, electrodes, and
the like, that may be used a heaters, sensors, and the like.</p><p num="0042">For the purposes of illustration only, and without limitation, embodiments of the
