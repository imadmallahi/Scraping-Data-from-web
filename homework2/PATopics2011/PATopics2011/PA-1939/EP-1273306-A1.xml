The powdery preparation for transmucosal administration has an improved

transmucosal administration comprising a medicine of high molecular weight
and a cationic polymer, the preparation further comprising a basic amino acid
and exhibiting an improved storage stability. Particularly, the invention
relates to such a preparation for administration through the nasal mucosa.</p><heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading><p num="0002">Currently, medicines of high molecular weight are administered by an
intravenous or subcutaneous injection for treatment. Administration of
medicines of high molecular weight by injection is difficult for patients to
perform by themselves and is accompanied by pain. It is hoped, therefore, to
employ transmucosal administration as an alternative and easier method of
administration. Examples of transmucosal administration include
administration through the mucosa of digestive tracts such as the stomach,
small intestine, large intestine, and rectum, as well as the nose, eye, mouth,
lung, and vagina. Administration through the nasal mucosa, among others, is
gaining attention as a relatively easy method of administration, which allows
for quick absorption of the drug and reliable effects.</p><p num="0003">The applicant has found that the difficulty associated with absorption
of a medicine of high molecular weight, contained in a powdery preparation
for transmucosal administration and absorbed through mucosa, can be
significantly reduced by providing the medicine of high molecular weight
with a cationic polymer (and additionally a viscous polymer, if necessary) 
(International Application No.: WO 00/02574).</p><p num="0004">The applicant has since made a continuous effort to find ways of
improving the storage stability of the preparation.</p><p num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a powdery
preparation for transmucosal administration comprising a medicine of high
molecular weight and a cationic polymer in which the storage stability of the
medicine of high molecular weight is improved while maintaining the
improved transmucosal absorption of the medicine of high molecular weight.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0006">The present invention is based on the inventors' realization that, in a
powdery preparation for transmucosal administration comprising a medicine
of high molecular weight and a cationic polymer with an improved mucosal
absorption, as described in the International Application No.: WO 00/02574,
the storage stability of the medicine can be significantly and unexpectedly
improved by adding an effective amount of basic amino acid.</p><p num="0007">The present invention can be summarized as follows.</p><p num="0008">The present invention, in its various embodiments, provides a powdery
preparation for transmucosal administration comprising one or more
medicines of high molecular weight and one or more cationic polymers with
an improved storage stability, wherein the preparation further comprising at
least one type of basic amino acid or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.</p><p num="0009">In a first embodiment of the present invention, the basic amino acid or
its salt is optically active or inactive histidine, arginine, lysine, a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a derivative thereof. The basic
amino acid or its salt is preferably optically active or inactive histidine,
arginine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and is more preferably
optically active or inactive histidine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof. </p><p num="0010">As used herein, "optically active" refers to the properties of a chiral
structure. An optically active substance normally has a three-dimensional D-or
L-, or S- or R-configuration. On the other hand, "optically inactive"
refers to the properties of an achiral structure.</p><p num="0011">In a second embodiment of the present invention, the improved storage
stability is characterized by the content (according to HPLC analysis) of the
medicine of high molecular weight of not less than 93%, preferably not less
than 96%, against the value of 100% at the initial point in a storage stability
test of 50°C for two weeks.</p><p num="0012">In a third embodiment of the present invention, the cationic polymer is
selected from the group consisting of aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer,
polyvinylacetal diethylaminoacetate, and poly-L-arginine. Preferably, the
cationic polymer is either aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer or
polyvinylacetal diethylaminoacetate. More preferably, the cationic polymer
is aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer.</p><p num="0013">As used herein, "cationic polymer" refers to a polymer having such a
structure where a cationic charge is present in a fundamental unit making up a
repetitive structure, or where a cationic charge comes into existence in the
fundamental unit when the polymer is dissolved.</p><p num="0014">In a fourth embodiment of the present invention, the preparation
further comprises one or more viscous polymers. The viscous polymer refers
to a polymer which exhibits a viscosity when dissolved or swelled.
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is an example of such polymer.</p><p num="0015">In a fifth embodiment of the present invention, the medicine of high
molecular weight is physiologically active peptide or protein (including
antibody, vaccine and antigen). Specific examples include, but are not
limited to, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, insulin, erythropoietin,
growth hormone, and influenza antigen.</p><p num="0016">In a sixth embodiment of the present invention, the preparation is 
adapted for transnasal administration.</p><p num="0017">In a seventh embodiment of the present invention, the preparation
further comprises one or more excipients. The excipient refers to a
substance that is added to the formula in order to impart proper hardness and
shape during the manufacture of drugs.</p><p num="0018">This specification includes part or all of the contents as disclosed in
the specification of Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-99213, which is a
priority document of the present application.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0019">The present invention will be hereafter described in detail.</p><p num="0020">The powdery preparation for transmucosal administration according to
the present invention can be obtained by adding to a medicine of high
molecular weight an excipient, a cationic polymer and basic amino acid or its
salt, and further a viscous polymer as needed, and additionally an appropriate
additive as needed, and then freeze-drying or spray-drying the mixture.</p><p num="0021">As used herein, the medicine of high molecular weight refers to a
bioactive peptide and protein (including antibodies, vaccines, and antigens).
Examples of the medicine of high molecular weight include, but are not
limited to: calcitonin, insulin, proinsulin, vasopressin, desmopressin,
luteinizing hormone, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, somatostatin,
prolactin, glucagon, gastrin, secretin, kallikrein, urokinase, neurotensin,
enkephalin, kyotorphin, endorphin, endothelin, angiotensin, transferrin, atrial
natriuretic peptide, epidermal growth factor, growth hormone, parathyroid
hormone, interferon, interleukin, tumor necrosis factor, leukemic cell
inhibiting factor, blood stem cell growth factor, erythropoietin, granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, 
thrombopoietin, superoxide dismutase, tissue plasminogen activator,
antithrombin, blood coagulation factor, anti-IgE antibody, anti-IgA antibody,
antitumor antibody, tumor necrosis factor antibody, anti-interleukin antibody,

hepatitis vaccine, influenza vaccine (influenza antigen), pertussis vaccine,
diphtheria vaccine, tetanus vaccine, and peptide or protein such as cedar
pollen and ragweed pollen that can function as an antigen, a conjugate of a
hapten thereof, and a mixture thereof with an adjuvant. It can be readily
estimated that even with medicines with smaller molecular weight than the
above examples of the medicine of high molecular weight, the present
invention can increase their absorption through mucous membranes,
particularly nasal mucosa, and therefore the present invention is believed also
useful in applications with a medicine of low-molecular weight.</p><p num="0022">Examples of the G-CSF, which is one of the medicines of high
molecular weight that can be used in the present invention, include a protein
with a human G-CSF activity represented by amino acid sequences of SEQ ID
NOS: 1-3, or a glycoprotein in which one or more sugar chains are attached to
the protein. The G-CSF according to the present invention further includes
G-CSF derivatives with G-CSF activity in which part of the above amino acid
sequences has been modified (i.e., by substitution, deletion, insertion and/or
addition of one or more amino acid residues). These G-CSFs can be
extracted, separated and purified from naturally occurring materials, or they
can be produced by a transformant obtained by transforming a host cell by
genetic engineering, and then isolated and purified. Examples of the host
cell include <i>Escherichia coli</i> and mammalian cells (such as C127 and CHO
cells). The detailed methods of manufacturing them are known from, e.g.,
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kohyo) No. 63-500636, Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) Nos. 62-236497, 62-236488, and
63-267292, and these known methods can be employed in the present 
invention.</p><p num="0023">The content of the medicine of high molecular weight in the powdery
preparation for transmucosal administration according to the present
invention is normally in the range of from 0.01 to 90 W/W%, preferably from
0.1 to 50W/W%. As used herein, W/W% refers to the ratio (weight %) of the
additive component relative to the entire weight of the preparation.</p><p num="0024">As used herein, the cationic polymer refers to a polymer with a
structure such that a cation charge is present in a fundamental unit making up
a repetitive structure, or such that a cation charge comes into existence in the
fundamental unit when the polymer is dissolved. The cationic polymer used
in the present invention is not limited to any particular polymer as long as it
can provide the effect of facilitating the absorption of the medicine of high
molecular weight through mucous membrane. Concrete examples include
aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, polyvinylacetal diethylaminoacetate, and
poly-L-arginine. Aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymers are available from,
e.g., Rohm Pharma under the trade names Eudragit E and Eudragit RS.
Eudragit E is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate and
dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, with an average molecular weight of
150,000. Polyvinylacetal diethylaminoacetate is available from, e.g.,
Sankyo (K.K.) under the trade name AEA. This is a copolymer in which
acetal compound obtained by dehydration of polyvinyl alcohol and
acetaldehyde, and diethyl amino acetic acid are joined via part of hydroxyl
groups of the acetal compound to form ester linkage, with an average
molecular weight of 65,000. Poly-L-arginine is a copolymer of L-arginine,
and it may have an average molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 1,000,000,
preferably from 12,100 to 92,000, and more preferably 92,000.
Poly-L-arginine is available from Sigma Chemical Co. The content of the
cationic polymer in the powdery preparation for transmucosal administration
according to the present invention is normally in the range of from 0.1 to 
90W/W%, preferably from 1 to 50W/W%.</p><p num="0025">As used herein, the basic amino acid is as defined above. Concrete
examples include L- or D-, S- or R-, and DL-histidine, arginine and lysine, a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a derivative thereof. Examples
of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt include salts with inorganic acids such
as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, and salts with organic
acids such as acetic acid, butyric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid,
and malic acid. Examples of the derivative include methylhistidine,
histidine methyl ester, acetyl histidine, acetyl lysine, hydroxylysine, and
acetyllysine methyl ester. The content of the basic amino acid or its salt in
the powdery preparation for transmucosal administration according to the
present invention is normally in the range of from 0.1 to 10.0W/W%,
preferably from 0.5 to 5.0W/W%. Other ranges may be used as long as they
can ensure the improvement in the storage stability of the medicine of high
molecular weight.</p><p num="0026">As used herein, the viscous polymer refers to a polymer that exhibits
viscosity when dissolved or swelled. The viscous polymer used in the
present invention may be of any type as long as it can increase, when used in
combination with the cationic polymer, the absorption of the medicine of high
molecular weight as compared with the case where the cationic polymer is
used alone. Specific examples of such a polymer include hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxyvinyl polymer, agar powder,
and gum arabic powder. The content of the viscous polymer in the powdery
preparation for transmucosal administration according to the present
invention is normally in the range of from 0.1 to 90W/W%, preferably from I
to 50W/W%.</p><p num="0027">The excipient used in the present invention is represented by
saccharides, of which examples include xylitol, fructose, sorbitol, lactose,
inositol, sucrose, and mannitol. Other examples of the excipients include 
starches, minerals, organic acids, and amino acids. The starches include
cornstarch, wheat starch, and potato starch. The minerals include calcium
phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate,
sodium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium carbonate, sodium chloride, and
calcium sulphate. The organic acids include succinic acid, tartaric acid,
citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, and a salt
thereof. The amino acids include D- and L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, and
L-glutamic acid. The content of the excipient in the powdery preparation for
transmucosal administration according to the present invention is normally in
the range of from 1 to 90W/W%, preferably from 5 to 80W/W%.</p><p num="0028">In the present invention, an additive such as a lubricant may be used as
needed. Examples of the lubricant include magnesium stearate, stearic acid,
and talc. The content of the additive in the powdery preparation for
transmucosal administration according to the present invention is normally in
the range of from 0.01 to 90W/W%, preferably from 0.05 to 50W/W%.</p><p num="0029">The powdery preparation for transmucosal administration according to
the present invention may be prepared by mixing, e.g., a (buffer) solution
containing a medicine of high molecular weight with a (buffer) solution in
which a cationic polymer, a basic amino acid or its salt, an excipient such as
sucrose and mannitol, and, if needed, a viscous polymer, have been dissolved
in advance. The mixture is then spray dried to obtain a powder. A
necessary amount of the obtained powder can be weighed and filled in a
capsule to obtain the powdery preparation.</p><p num="0030">The powder of the preparation thus manufactured normally has a
particle size (diameter) in the range of from 0.1 to 500 µm, preferably from 5
to 100 µm.</p><p num="0031">Capsulation makes the handling of the powdery preparation for
transmucosal administration easy. Examples of the material for the capsule
include gelatin, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methylcellulose, and starch. 
To these materials, glycerin, sorbitol, carrageenan, polyethylene glycol, gum
arabic, or the like may be added, to thereby increase plasticity.</p><p num="0032">As a further additive, one or more of potassium chloride, sucrose,
coloring agent, and titanium oxide may be added.</p><p num="0033">The powdery preparation for transmucosal administration according to
the present invention can be administered to the patient's mucosa when
needed or at proper intervals of administration. Examples of the mucosa
include the mucosae of nose, eye, mouth, lung, vagina, and digestive tracts
such as the stomach, small intestine, large intestine and rectum. When the
preparation according to the present invention is administered through nose,
for example, a capsule containing the powdery preparation may be set in a
miniature spray apparatus (Pulverizer). A hole is cut in the capsule, the
nozzle of the pulverizer is inserted into one or both of the nostrils, and the
powdery preparation can be sprayed into the nasal cavity by squeezing the
rubber ball while inhaling through nose. A preparation containing a
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as an active ingredient can be
administered to a patient one to four times a day, and in the amount of the
active ingredient of 1 to 500 µg/kg/day, preferably 5 to 100 µg/kg/day. A
preparation containing insulin as an active ingredient can be administered to a
patient one to four times a day, and in the amount of the active ingredient of
0.1 to 100 U/kg/day, preferably 0.5 to 20 U/kg/day. A preparation
comprising erythropoietin as an active ingredient can be administered to a
patient one to four times a day, and in the amount of the active ingredient of
50 to 50,000 IU/kg/day, preferably 200 to 8,000 IU/kg/day. A preparation
comprising growth hormone as an active ingredient can be administered to a
patient one to four times a day, and in the amount of the active ingredient of
0.1 to 50 IU/kg/day, preferably 0.4 to 15 IU/kg/day. A preparation
comprising influenza antigen as an active ingredient can be administered to a
subject one to four times a day at intervals of 2 to 6 weeks, and in the amount 
of the active ingredient of 0.5 to 200 CCA/kg/day, preferably 2 to 40
CCA/kg/day.</p><p num="0034">As described above, the present invention is characterized in that, in a
powdery preparation for transmucosal administration comprising a medicine
of high molecular weight and a cationic polymer with an improved mucosal
absorption, the storage stability of the medicine of high molecular weight is
improved to a practical level. In this respect, the present invention is an
improvement over the invention disclosed in the applicant's International
Application WO 00/02574. Accordingly, the various specific examples
disclosed in the above international application are also applicable to the
present invention and, therefore, all of the contents disclosed therein are
incorporated in the present specification.</p><heading>Examples</heading><p num="0035">While the invention will be hereafter described by way of specific
