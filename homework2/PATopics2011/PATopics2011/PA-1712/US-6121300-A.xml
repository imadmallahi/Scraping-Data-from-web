Its earliest manifestation was in the appearance of brown pigments during the cooking of food, which was identified by Maillard in 1912, who observed that glucose or other reducing sugars react with amino acids to form adducts that undergo a series of dehydrations and rearrangements to form stable brown pigments. Further studies have suggested that stored and heat treated foods undergo nonenzymatic browning as a result of the reaction between glucose and the polypeptide chain, and that the proteins are resultantly cross-linked and correspondingly exhibit decreased bioavailability. As described in copending application Ser. No. 08/588,249, incorporated herein by reference, these reactions have a parallel in vivo, and have been found to occur with a variety of other body proteins, such as lens crystallins, collagen and nerve proteins. These reactions are accelerated in the presence of elevated glucose levels, as occur in individuals with diabetes mellitus, but still occur in vivo at normal glucose levels. Termed advanced glycosylation (or glycation) end products (AGEs), the cross-linked products involving structural and other proteins within the body leads not only to aberrant physico-chemical properties of, for example, connective tissue, but also results in the formation of new chemical structures which are recognized by specific receptors on various cell types and as a consequence of their recognition, initiate pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the complications of diabetes and aging.</p><p>Several successful therapeutic approaches have been achieved based upon intervening in the accumulation of AGEs in vivo. One approach, exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,583, incorporated herein by reference, concerns the inhibition of the formation of AGEs from its precursors, by the administration of agents such as aminoguanidine and related compounds. By reacting with an early glycosylation product that results from the original reaction between the target protein and glucose, these agents block the formation of AGEs and further formation of AGEs and cross-links in tissues is inhibited. Efficacy of this approach has been demonstrated in numerous animal models of diabetes and aging, including positive effects on macrovascular, renal, retinal, and neural pathology. These data have been reviewed by Vlassara et al., 1994, "Biology of Diseases. Pathogenic effects of advanced glycosylation: biochemical, biologic and clinical implications for diabetes and aging," Laboratory Investigation 70:138-151; Brownlee, 1995, "The pathological implications of protein glycation," Clin. Invest. Med., 18:275-281; and Brownlee, 1995, "Advanced protein glycosylation in diabetes and aging," Ann. Rev. Med. 46:223-34.</p><p>In another pharmacological approach to controlling levels of AGEs in tissues, especially in those tissues in which AGE cross-links have already accumulated to levels which are responsible for subclinical or clinical pathology, administration of agents that reverse or break AGE cross-links has proven successful. As described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,656,261 and 5,853,703 and 08/848,776, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, agents and methods are disclosed which reverse (also termed cleave or break) existing AGE cross-links in vitro and in vivo. Studies demonstrate positive effects of such agents on cardiovascular complications related to aging which are accelerated in experimental diabetes (see Wolffenbuttel et al., 1998, "Breakers of Advanced Glycation End Products Restores Large Artery Properties in Experimental Diabetes," Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95:4630-4634). In these studies, rats diabetic for 9 weeks followed by 1 to 3 weeks administration of an AGE breaker compound resulted in reversal of diabetes-induced increases in large artery stiffness. Parameters that were improved included cardiac output, peripheral resistance, systemic arterial compliance, input impedance of the aorta, and compliance of the carotid artery.</p><p>It is toward the identification of additional agents capable of reversing AGE cross-links that the present invention is directed.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In accordance with the present invention, compounds and method are disclosed for reversing AGE cross-linking. AGE cross-linking caused by other reactive sugars present in vivo or in foodstuffs, including ribose, galactose and fructose would also be reversed by the methods and compositions of the present invention.</p><p>The agents useful in the present invention are members of the class of compounds known as thiazoliums, and in particular thiazolium compounds substituted with heterocyclic groups.</p><p>The agents comprise compounds having the following structural formula: ##STR1## wherein R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and an alkyl group optionally substituted by a hydroxy group;</p><p>Y is a group of the formula --CH.sub.2 C(═O)R wherein R is a heterocyclic group other than alkylenedioxyaryl containing 4-10 ring members and 1-3 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur; said heterocyclic group optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl, oxo, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, aryl, and aralkyl; and said one or more substituents optionally substituted by one or more alkyl or alkoxy groups;</p><p>or a group of the formula --CH.sub.2 C(═O)--NHR' wherein R' is a heterocyclic group containing 4-10 ring members and 1-3 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur; said heterocyclic group optionally substituted by one or more alkoxycarbonylalkyl groups;</p><p>and X is a halide, tosylate, methanesulfonate or mesitylenesulfonate ion.</p><p>The ability to reverse already-formed advanced glycosylation products carries with it significant implications in all applications where advanced glycation and concomitant molecular crosslinking is a serious detriment. In the area of food technology, for instance, the cleavage of cross-links would confer a reversal of the increased toughness resulting from the formation of AGEs during storage. In a preferred embodiment, the application of agents capable of reversal of the Maillard process has particular benefit in vivo as AGE cross-linking adversely affects several of the significant protein masses in the body, among them collagen, elastin, lens proteins, and the kidney glomerular basement membrane. These proteins deteriorate both with age (hence the application of the term "protein aging") and more rapidly as a consequence of diabetes. Accordingly, the ability to reverse the cross-linking of these proteins and thus to reduce the amount of cross-links present between advanced glycosylation end products and other proteins in the body carries the promise for treatment of the complications of diabetes and aging for instance, and thereby improving the quality and, perhaps, duration of animal and human life.</p><p>It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide agents which reverse the advanced glycosylation end products formed as a consequence of the aforesaid advanced glycosylation reaction sequence by cleaving the α-dicarbonyl-based protein crosslinks present in the advanced glycosylation end products.</p><p>It is a still further object of the present invention to provide therapeutic methods of treating the adverse consequences of molecular or protein aging by resort to the aforesaid method and agents to achieve the reversal or cleavage of cross-links derived from advanced glycosylation reactions.</p><p>It is a still further object of the present invention to provide compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions, incorporating the agents of the present invention.</p><p>Other objects and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the ensuing description.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In accordance with the present invention, agents, compositions including pharmaceutical compositions containing said agents and associated methods are described which reverse already-formed advanced glycosylation end product-derived cross-links (AGE cross-links).

The cross-linking of proteins by formation of advanced glycosylation end products contributes to the entrapment of other proteins and results in the development in vivo of conditions such as reduced elasticity and wrinkling of the skin, certain kidney diseases, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis and the like. Similarly, foodstuffs including plant and animal material that undergoes nonenzymatic browning deteriorates and becomes spoiled or toughened and, consequently, inedible, unpalatable or non-nutritious. Thus, the compounds employed in accordance with this invention reduce the level of the advanced glycosylation end product-associated cross-links already present in the protein material.</p><p>The present methods and compositions hold the promise for reversing the aging of key proteins both in animals and plants, and concomitantly, conferring both economic and medical benefits as a result thereof. In the instance of foodstuffs, the administration of the present composition holds the promise for reversing the physico-chemical changes imparted to foodstuffs on storage, such as the increased toughness of meats that occurs during aging or storage.</p><p>The therapeutic implications of the present invention relate to the reversal of the aging process which has, as indicated earlier, been identified and exemplified in the aging of key proteins by advanced glycosylation and cross-linking. Thus, body proteins, and particularly structural body proteins, such as collagen, elastin, lens proteins nerve proteins, kidney glomerular basement membranes and other extravascular matrix components would all benefit in their longevity and operation from the practice of the present invention. The present invention thus reduces the incidence of pathologies involving the entrapment of proteins by cross-linked target proteins, such as retinopathy, cataracts, diabetic kidney disease, glomerulosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, arteriosclerosis obliterans, peripheral neuropathy, stroke, hypertension, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, periarticular rigidity, loss of elasticity and wrinkling of skin, stiffening of joints, glomerulonephritis, etc. Likewise, all of these conditions are in evidence and tend to occur at an accelerated rate in patients afflicted with diabetes mellitus as a consequence of their hyperglycemia. Thus, the present therapeutic method is relevant to treatment of these and related conditions in patients either of advanced age or those suffering from one of the mentioned pathologies.</p><p>Molecular cross-linking through advanced glycosylation product formation can decrease solubility of structural proteins such as collagen in vessel walls and can also trap serum proteins, such as lipoproteins to the collagen. Also, the presence of advanced glycosylation end products and associated cross-links may result in increased permeability of the endothelium and consequently covalent trapping of extravasated plasma proteins in subendothelial matrix, as well as a reduction in susceptibility of both plasma and matrix proteins to physiologic degradation by enzymes. For these reasons, the progressive occlusion of diabetic vessels induced by chronic hyperglycemia has been hypothesized to result from excessive formation of sugar-derived and particularly, glucose-derived cross-links. Such diabetic microvascular changes and microvascular occlusion can be effectively reversed by chemical reversal or cleavage of the advanced glycosylation product cross-link formation utilizing a composition and the methods of the present invention.</p><p>Certain of the compounds disclosed herein are novel: ##STR3## wherein R.sup.1 and R.sup.2 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and an alkyl group, optionally substituted by a hydroxy group;</p><p>Y is a group of the formula --CH.sub.2 C(═O)R wherein R is a heterocyclic group other than alkylenedioxyaryl containing 4-10 ring members and one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of sulfur and nitrogen, or 2-3 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur; said heterocyclic group optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl, oxo, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, aryl, and aralkyl groups; and said one or more substituents optionally substituted by one or more alkyl or alkoxy groups;</p><p>or a group of the formula --CH.sub.2 C(═O)--NHR' wherein R' is a heterocyclic group containing 4-10 ring members and 1-3 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur; said heterocyclic group optionally substituted by one or more alkoxycarbonylalkyl groups;</p><p>and X is a halide, tosylate, methanesulfonate or mesitylenesulfonate ion.</p><p>The heterocyclic groups referred to herein include 4-8 membered rings having at least one nitrogen or sulfur atom, or 4-8 membered rings having 2-3 heteroatoms, e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, therein; and including various degrees of unsaturation.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) bound to the surface of the washed RBCs was then determined.</p><p>Assay for RBC-IgG: The assay is performed in a Multiscreen-HA, 0.45 μm cellulose mixed esters membrane-sealed 96 well plate (Millipore MAHAS45). The membranes are first wet by filling the wells with 100 uL PBS, and the wells emptied by applying a vacuum to the Millititer vacuum manifold. Three hundred uL of Superblock (pre-warmed to 37 to each well and incubated at 37 is then removed from the wells by application of vacuum, then the wells are washed once with 300 ul of PBS-Tween (0.05%) and three times with PBS. The vacuum is then turned off.</p><p>One hundred μl of PBS is then added to each well. Each RBC sample is gently vortexed, and 50 uL pipetted into the wells, in sextuplicate. The wells labeled A1-A3 are left for a reagent blank and wells A4-A6 reserved for an antibody blank. Vacuum is then applied to remove the buffer and the RBCs are washed once with PBS. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled rabbit-anti-rat IgG is diluted 1 to 25000 in PBS, and 50 μl is added to triplicate wells of each sample. PBS alone is added to the other three wells of each sample. These will serve as sample blanks to adjust for any endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. The samples are allowed to stand at room temperature for two hours. The solution is then removed by application of vacuum and the red blood cells are washed with PBS-Tween twice, PBS twice and with TBS twice. The bottom of the plate is rinsed with distilled water and blotted dry with paper towels. To each well is then added 100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (1 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer pH 9.5), and the color is allowed to develop for two hours at 37 a 96 well microtiter plate inside the vacuum manifold. One hundred μl of PBS to each well and vacuum applied again to transfer any remaining solution into the microtiter plate. The OD at 410 nm is then read in a Dynatech Plate reader (Sample filter 1 and Ref filter 4).</p><p>For data analysis, breaking activity (percent reversal) is expressed as the percent decrease in O.D. caused by incubation of RBC with the test compound compared to RBC incubated in PBS alone.

AGE-BSA is prepared by incubation of a solution of BSA (400 mg/ml) in 0.4 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with an equal volume of 400 mM glucose solution in the same buffer at 37 weeks. The pH of the incubation mixture is monitored weekly and adjusted to pH 7.4 if necessary. After 12 weeks, the AGE-BSA solution is dialyzed against PBS for 48 hours with 4 buffer changes. Protein concentration is determined by the micro-Lowry method.</p><p>Assay protocol. A Biocoat (Collaborative Biomedical Products) plate is blocked with Superblock (300 mL /well) at 37 washed with PBS-Tween three times. AGE-BSA was diluted in PBS to a concentration required to obtain maximum cross-linking as determined in a preliminary experiment. One hundred μl of the AGE-BSA working solution is added to test wells and a similar concentration of BSA is added to blank wells. The first three wells are left empty for the reagent blank. The plate is incubated at 37 PBS-Tween three times. Test compounds are dissolved in PBS and pH adjusted to 7.0 if necessary. One hundred μl of a test compound is added to triplicate wells. To measure maximum crosslinking 100 μl of PBS is added to three to six wells. The test compounds and PBS are also added to triplicate wells incubated with BSA, to obtain the blank readings. The plate is then incubated overnight at 37 with PBS-Tween, 50 mL of Rabbit-anti-BSA antibody (1 to 4000 in PBS) is added to each well and the plate is incubated at room temperature for 60 min. After the plate is washed with PBS-Tween, 50 mL of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated -goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1 to 4000 in PBS) is added to each well except the first three wells. The plate is incubated at room temperature for 30 min. and washed with PBS-Tween.
