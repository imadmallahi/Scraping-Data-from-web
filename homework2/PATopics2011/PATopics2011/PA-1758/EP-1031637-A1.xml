cobalt, 4.7-5.7wt% chromium, 2.4-3.0wt% molybdenum, 3.0-3.8wt%
tungsten, 3.0-3.8wt% rhenium, 5.5-7.0wt% aluminium,
5.0-6.0wt% tantalum, 0.5-1.0wt% niobium, 0-0.2wt% hafnium, 0-150ppm
carbon, 0-100ppm yttrium, 0-100ppm lanthanum, 0-5ppm
sulphur and the balance nickel plus incidental impurities.
The nickel based single crystal superalloy is suitable for
use as a gas turbine engine turbine blade or turbine vane.
It is of particular use on cooled turbine blades and turbine
vanes which have ceramic thermal barrier coatings, because
the superalloy is compatible with the ceramic thermal barrier
coating to minimise spalling. The superalloy has lower
density than other second generation single crystal
superalloys but similar creep strength and oxidation
resistance.

superalloys, particularly to nickel based single crystal
superalloys, or particularly nickel based single crystal
superalloys for use as turbine blades, turbine vanes, turbine
seals and combustor components of gas turbine engines, but
they may be used in internal combustion engines etc.</p><p num="0002">Nickel based single crystal superalloys have been
developed to provide improved high temperature mechanical
properties such as creep strength. However, there are many
other important properties which need to be optimised to a
high level in order for a nickel based single crystal
superalloy to be acceptable for use in a gas turbine engine.
Other properties which need to be optimised are density,
resistance to oxidation, resistance to corrosion,
compatibility with protective coatings, heat treatment
response and castability.</p><p num="0003">There are three generations of nickel based single
crystal superalloys which differ by the amount of the key
element rhenium. The first generation of nickel based single
crystal superalloys contained no rhenium, examples of these
are disclosed in published UK patent application nos.
GB2039296A, GB2073774A, GB2105369A, GB2106138A and
GB2151659A. The first generation of nickel based single
crystal superalloys have densities of 7.9 to 8.7 gm per cm<sup>3</sup>.
The second generation of nickel based single crystal
superalloys contained about 3wt% rhenium, examples of these
are disclosed in published European patent application nos.
EP0155827A and EP0208645A. The second generation of nickel
based single crystal superalloys have densities of 8.7 to 8.9
gm per cm<sup>3</sup>. The second generation of nickel based single
crystal superalloys have a benefit in creep strength
capability of about 30°C over the first generation of nickel
based single crystal superalloys. The third generation of
nickel based single crystal superalloys contained about 6wt% 
rhenium, examples of these are disclosed in US patents
US5366695 and US5270123 and published European patent
application no. EP0848071A. The third generation of nickel
based single crystal superalloys have densities of 8.9 to 9.1
gm per cm<sup>3</sup>. The third generation of nickel based single
crystal superalloys have a benefit in creep strength
capability of about 30°C over the second generation of nickel
based single crystal superalloys.</p><p num="0004">Thus it is seen that the increase in creep strength is
to the detriment of the density and the cost of the
superalloy. An increase in density of the turbine blades and
turbine vanes makes the gas turbine engine heavier and also
results in a requirement to make the turbine rotor disc
stronger to carry the heavier turbine blades, which also
results in an increase in the weight of the turbine rotor
disc.</p><p num="0005">The turbine blades requiring the greatest creep strength
are usually those in the first stage of uncooled turbine
blades, and for these turbine blades a third generation
nickel based single crystal superalloy is used. However, for
turbine blades and turbine vanes which are cooled the
requirements are different. The creep strength requirement
is lower and hence creep properties similar to the second
generation nickel based single crystal superalloy are
sufficient. It is often the case that these cooled turbine
blades and turbine vanes are protected by a ceramic thermal
barrier coating. A major concern with a ceramic thermal
barrier coating is that the ceramic thermal barrier coating
will spall prematurely during engine service. The adherence
of a ceramic thermal barrier coating is influenced by many
factors, but a major factor is the composition of the
superalloy substrate on which the ceramic thermal barrier
coating is deposited.</p><p num="0006">The present invention seeks to provide a novel nickel
based single crystal superalloy which has creep properties
and high temperature oxidation resistance similar to a second 
generation nickel based single crystal superalloy but has
reduced density compared to a second generation nickel based
single crystal superalloy and better compatibility with a
ceramic thermal barrier coating than a second generation
nickel based single crystal superalloy.</p><p num="0007">Accordingly the present invention provides a nickel
based single crystal superalloy comprising 3-11wt% cobalt,

initially tested for
compatibility with a known thermal barrier coating system by
depositing about 8 µm of platinum onto the samples of the
superalloy substrate and heat treating at 1150°C to form a
layer comprising platinum enriched gamma phase and platinum 
enriched gamma prime phase. This layer together with a layer
of alumina which forms on the layer becomes a bond coating
for a ceramic thermal barrier coating deposited by electron
beam physical vapour deposition.</p><p num="0026">The samples of the superalloys with the bond coatings
and ceramic thermal barrier coatings were isothermally soaked
for 25 hours at specific temperatures, and the temperature at
which the ceramic thermal barrier coating spalled was noted
and the highest temperature at which the ceramic thermal
barrier coating did not spall was noted. The temperature
above which the ceramic thermal barrier coating spalls is a
measure of the compatibility between the superalloy substrate
and the ceramic thermal barrier coating. The levels of
sulphur and titanium and the highest temperature at which the
ceramic thermal barrier coating did not spall are shown in

It can be seen that low sulphur levels in the superalloy are
beneficial for compatibility with the ceramic thermal barrier
coating, see for example superalloy 2077 which has 16ppm
sulphur and this loses it's ceramic thermal barrier coating
above 1170°C. High levels of rhenium in the superalloy are
beneficial for compatibility with the ceramic thermal barrier
coating, see for example CMSX10 which has 6.2wt% rhenium
loses it's ceramic thermal barrier coating above 1250°C and
superalloy 2084 which has 3.4wt% rhenium loses it's ceramic
thermal barrier coating above 1230°C is much better than
superalloys 2080 to 2083 which have 3.0wt% rhenium and which
lose their ceramic thermal barrier coatings above 1210°C.
Low, preferably zero, levels of titanium in the superalloy
are beneficial for compatibility with the ceramic thermal
barrier coating, see for example CMSX10 which has 0.20wt%
titanium and superalloy 2079 and 2084 which have zero
titanium lose their ceramic thermal barrier coatings above
1230°C and CMSX4 which has 1.0wt% titanium and low sulphur
level loses it's ceramic thermal barrier coating above 1190°C.
Low levels of cobalt are beneficial for compatibility with
the ceramic thermal barrier coating, see for example the
alloy sequence 2084, 2085 and 2086, in which the alloys have
the same composition apart from a progressive increase in
cobalt level from 4wt% to 10wt%. The spallation temperature
decreased progressively from 1230°C to 1190°C in that
sequence.</p><p num="0027">In summary for compatibility with the ceramic thermal
barrier coating the superalloy should have as low a level of
sulphur as possible, preferably less than 5ppm, preferably
zero, but his depends on the purity of the raw materials.
The superalloy should have zero titanium. The superalloy
should have as high a rhenium level as possible, but this is
limited by the density and cost requirements. The superalloy
should have a low cobalt level, around 4wt%, unless the 
requirement for metallurgical stability is paramount, in
which case a high cobalt level, around 10wt%, is preferred.</p><p num="0028">In order to achieve lower density the level of tungsten
is reduced and the level of molybdenum is increased, the
level of tantalum is reduced and the level of niobium is
increased and the level of titanium is reduced to zero and
the level of aluminium is increased as seen in Table 1. This
produced a reduction in the density of the superalloy to 8.5
to 8.6 gm per cm<sup>3</sup> from 8.7 to 8.9 gm per cm<sup>3</sup> of existing
second generation nickel based single crystal superalloys.</p><p num="0029">The requirement for high temperature oxidation
resistance is essentially the same as the requirement for
compatibility with ceramic thermal barrier coatings, but with
a requirement for high levels of aluminium. Additionally
yttrium and/or lanthanum may be added at a up to 100 parts
per million to improve oxidation resistance.</p><p num="0030">The requirement for stability of the superalloy is
achieved by setting the cobalt level to 9-11wt%, because it
is believed that this level of cobalt in a second generation
nickel based single crystal superalloy suppresses the
formation of topologically close packed (TCP) phases.
However, if the requirement for thermal barrier compatibility
is paramount, a low cobalt level, around 4wt% is preferred.</p><p num="0031">The requirement for high temperature creep strength,
greater than 1100°C is achieved by producing a stable set of
gamma prime phase plates perpendicular to the stress
direction. This requires a negative gamma phase/gamma prime
phase mismatch at the operating temperature, and the mismatch
becomes more negative as the temperature increases. The
mismatch was set at 0-0.1% at room temperature, this is less
than the 0.17% mismatch of CMSX4. A practical superalloy
requires good creep strength across the temperature range
850°C-1050°C as well as greater than 1100°C. The creep
strength in the temperature range 850°C-1050°C is controlled
by the composition of the gamma phase, the width of the gamma
phase channels between the gamma prime phase particles, the 
gamma phase/gamma prime phase mismatch and the strength of
the gamma prime phase. The gamma phase/gamma prime phase
mismatch is already fixed and the gamma phase channel width
is controlled by the volume fraction of gamma prime phase,
aiming to be about 65%.</p><p num="0032">The requirement for corrosion resistance is not as
critical as other properties because superalloys are
generally provided with protective coatings. However to
provide some corrosion resistance chromium is provided, but
chromium has the detrimental effect of promoting the
formation of the sigma phase, however slightly lower chromium
levels may be tolerated if the rhenium level is higher.
Hence the rhenium level is increased to about 3.4wt%.</p><p num="0033">The requirement for freckling resistance is important in
the castability of the superalloy. Freckles are small chains
of equiaxed grains that form during the solidification of the
single crystal superalloy. Freckles form because of
differences in density between the solid and liquid phases in
the mushy zone, the density gradient produces currents in the
liquid phase which break off pieces of dendrite. The pieces
of dendrite promote the nucleation of separate grains.
Freckling is controlled by having sufficient heavy gamma
prime phase forming elements such as tantalum to balance the
heavy gamma phase forming elements such as tungsten and
rhenium. A simple empirical formula to avoid freckling is:-
 Ta / W+Re
 is greater than or equal to 0.8

A more complex empirical formula to avoid freckling is
defined in published International patent application No
W097/48827A:-
 Ta+(1.5xHf)+(0.5xMo)-(0.5xTi) / W+(1.2xRe)
 is greater than 0.7, pref 1.0
 
The above two formulas use wt%. The superalloys of the
present invention have a parameter of 0.95 for the latter
formula and this should give little freckling.</p><p num="0034">Oxide inclusions may promote the formation of defects in
single crystal superalloy castings. The requirement for
alloy cleanliness is achieved by adding carbon because it is
known that carbon reduces the level of deleterious oxides
inclusions in the single crystal superalloy. The carbon may
also provide some grain boundary strength. However, too much
carbon promotes script carbides which reduce the fatigue
strength of the superalloy. Therefore carbon up to 150ppm,
preferably 100ppm, may be added to clean the superalloy
without any significant effect on the fatigue strength.</p><p num="0035">Cyclic oxidation testing has been performed on a burner
rig, the cycling rate was 4 cycles per hour and 0.25 ppm of
simulated sea salt was added to the gas flow to simulate
operation in a marine environment. The measure of the amount
of attack on the superalloy is by metal loss per surface and
the data is shown in figure 1 for testing at a temperature of
1100°C for superalloys 2073, 2080-2084, 2086 and CMSX4. It
can be seen that superalloys 2080-2084 and 2086have similar
oxidation resistance to CMSX4. In fact the preferred
superalloy 2086 has the best oxidation resistance of the
series.</p><p num="0036">The creep performance can be expressed as the time to 1%
creep strain under various conditions of stress and
temperature. These times for the superalloys 2084 and 2086
are listed in Table 3, and a comparison is made with the
creep properties of CMSX4 in figure 2. The vertical axis of
this graph is the ratio of creep lives between superalloys
2084 or 2086 of the present invention and CMSX4. The general
trend is for the superalloys of the present invention to be
worse than CMSX4 at temperatures below 850°C, and equivalent
to CMSX4 at temperatures above 850°C up to 1100°C, the highest
temperature at which tests were performed. <tables><table><tgroup cols="4"><tbody><row><entry align="center" namest="1">Test Temperature (°C)</entry><entry align="center" namest="2">Stress (Mpa)</entry><entry nameend="4" align="center" namest="3">Time to 1% Strain (hrs)</entry></row><row><entry align="center"/><entry align="center"/><entry align="center">2084</entry><entry align="center">2086</entry></row><row><entry align="left">750</entry><entry align="right">720</entry><entry align="left">5</entry><entry align="center">2.3</entry></row><row><entry align="left">850</entry><entry align="right">430</entry><entry align="left">785</entry><entry align="center">480</entry></row><row><entry align="left">900</entry><entry align="right">290</entry><entry align="left">139</entry><entry align="center">142</entry></row><row><entry align="left">950</entry><entry align="right">210</entry><entry align="left">517</entry><entry align="center">829</entry></row><row><entry align="left">1000</entry><entry align="right">165</entry><entry align="left">410</entry><entry align="center">514</entry></row><row><entry align="left">1050</entry><entry align="right">165</entry><entry align="left">91</entry><entry align="center">89</entry></row><row><entry align="left">1100</entry><entry align="right">115</entry><entry align="left">152</entry><entry align="center">251</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p num="0037">The main advantage of the nickel based single crystal
