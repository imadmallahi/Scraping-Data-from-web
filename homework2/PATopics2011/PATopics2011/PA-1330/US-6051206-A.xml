Description of the Prior Art</p><p>Somatostatin is a tetradecapeptide that is endogenously produced by the hypothalamus and pancreas in humans and other mammals. The peptide has the formula: ##STR1## (Single letter abbreviations for amino acids can be bound in G. Zubay, Biochemistry (2d ed.), 1988, (MacMillan Publishing: New York), p. 33). This peptide exerts a wide variety of biological effects in vivo. It is known to act physiologically on the central nervous system, the hypothalamus, the pancreas, and the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Somatostatin inhibits the release of insulin and glucagon from the pancreas, inhibits growth hormone release from the hypothalamus, and reduces gastric secretions. Thus, somatostatin has clinical and therapeutic applications for the alleviation of a number of ailments and diseases, both in humans and other animals. Native somatostatin is of limited utility, however, due to its short half-life in vivo, where it is rapidly degraded by peptidases. For this reason, somatostatin analogues having improved in vivo stability have been developed in the prior art.</p><p>Freidinger, U.S. Pat.

These high-affinity somatostatin binding sites have been found to be abundantly expressed at the cell surface of most endocrine-active tumors arising from these tissues. Expression of high-affinity binding sites for somatostatin is a marker for these tumor cells, and specific binding with somatostatin can be exploited to locate and identify tumor cells in vivo.</p><p>Methods for radiolabeling somatostatin analogues that have been modified so as to contain a tyrosine amino acid (Tyr or Y) are known in the prior art.</p><p>Albert et al., UK Patent Application 8927255.3 disclose radioimaging using somatostatin derivatives such as octreotide labeled with .sup.123 I.</p><p>Bakker et al., 1990, J.

Nucl.

Radionuclides which emit gamma radiation can be readily detected by scintigraphy after injection into a human or an animal. A variety of radionuclides are known to be useful for radioimaging, including .sup.67 Ga, .sup.68 Ga, .sup.99m Tc (Tc-99m), .sup.111 In, .sup.123 I or .sup.125 I. The sensitivity of imaging methods using radioactively-labeled peptides is much higher than other techniques known in the art, since the specific binding of the radioactive peptide concentrates the radioactive signal over the cells of interest, for example, tumor cells. This is particularly important for endocrine-active gastrointestinal tumors, which are usually small, slow-growing and difficult to detect by conventional methods.</p><p>Labeling with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is advantageous because the, nuclear and radioactive properties of this isotope make it an ideal scintigraphic imaging agent. Tc-99m has a single photon energy of 140 keV and a radioactive half-life of about 6 hours, and is readily available from a .sup.99 Mo-.sup.99m Tc generator. Other radionuclides have effective half-lives which are much longer (or example, .sup.111 In, which has a half-life of 60-70 h) or are toxic (for example, .sup.125 I). Although Tc-99m is an ideal radiolabeling reagent, it has not been widely used for labeling peptides in the art prior to the present invention (see, for example, Lamberts, 1991, J. Nucl. Med. 32:1189-1191).</p><p>Somatostatin and radiolabeled somatostatin analogues can also be used therapeutically. For these applications, cytotoxic radioisotopes are advantageous, such as scandium47, copper-67, gallium-72, yttrium-90, tin-117m, iodine-125, iodine-131, samarium-153, gadolinium-159, dysprosium-165, holmium-166, ytterbium-175, lutetium-177, rhenium-186, rhenium-188, astatine-211 and bismuth-212. The rhenium isotopes .sup.186 Re and .sup.188 Re, as well as Sn-117m are particularly advantageous.</p><p>The use of chelating agents for radiolabeling proteins are known in the prior art, and methods for labeling peptides with Tc-99m are disclosed in co-owned U.S. Pat.

In one such embodiment is provided a scintigraphic imaging agent wherein the somatostatin analogue, cyclic peptide reagents of the invention are radiolabeled with technetium-99m. In other embodiments of the scintigraphic imaging agents of the invention the radioisotope is indium-111 or gallium-68. In still other embodiments, the scintigraphic imaging agents of the invention are cyclic peptides that are radiolabeled with iodine-123 or iodine-125.</p><p>The invention also provides radiotherapeutic agents that are the cyclic peptide reagents of the invention radiolabeled with a cytotoxic radioisotope that is selected from the group consisting of scandium-47, copper-67, gallium-72, yttrium-90, tin-117m, samarium-153, gadolinium-159, dysprosium-165, holmium-166, ytterbium-175, lutetium-177, rhenium-186, rhenium-188, and bismuth-212. In preferred embodiments, the radioisotope is tin-117m, rhenium-186 or rhenium-188. In additional preferred embodiments, the cyclic peptides of the invention are radiolabeled with iodine-125, iodine-131 or astatine-211.</p><p>The invention further provides therapeutic agents comprising the cyclic peptide reagents of the invention, optionally wherein the reagents form a complex with a non-radioactive metal, preferably rhenium. Combination embodiments, wherein such a complex is also radiolabeled, either directly or via a radiolabel-binding moiety, are also provided by the invention and are within its scope.</p><p>The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the somatostatin receptor-binding peptides of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p>The somatostatin analogues of the invention are therapeutically useful in the alleviation of diseases or other ailments in humans or other animals. The invention provides a method for alleviating somatostatin-related diseases in animals, preferably humans, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the somatostatin analogues of the invention to the animal. In preferred embodiments, the amount of the somatostatin analogue administered is from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg body weight/day.</p><p>Another aspect of the present invention provides reagents for preparing radiotherapeuic and radiodiagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including preferably scintigraphic imaging agents. Each such reagent is comprised of a peptide that is somatostatin analogue covalently linked to a radiolabel-binding moiety.</p><p>It is an advantage of the somatostatin analogues provided by the invention that the non-disulfide cyclic linkage is stable in the presence of reducing agents used to form a complex between a radioisotope and a radiolabel binding moiety of the invention comprising a thiol group. The somatostatin analogues of the invention are advantageous over somatostatin and previously-used disulfide-containing somatostatin analogues. These prior art reagents contain a disulfide bond, which disulfide bond is unstable in the presence of reducing agents useful in the production of radiolabel complexes with various radiolabel binding moieties. The biological activity of these previously-known reagents was thereby reduced, and the efficacy of scintigraphic imaging agents derived therefrom compromised, by reduction of these peptide structure-determining disulfide bonds. Such destabilization of the structure of the peptide reagents of this invention does not occur due to the lack of such unstable disulfide bonds in the somatostatin receptor binding compounds comprising the instant invention. Thus, the use of thiol-containing radiolabel chelating moieties and the use of reducing agents to form radioisotope complexes therewith does not result in loss of biological activity of the somatostatin receptor binding compounds of this invention.</p><p>It is another advantage of the somatostatin analogues provided by this invention that formation of the covalent conjugate between the peptides and thiol-containing radiolabel binding moieties of the invention does not result in "scrambing" of structurally-important disulfide bonds. Unlike peptide moieties comprising a disulfide bond, the non-disulfide cyclic linkage contained in the peptide reagents of the invention does not interfere with thiol-containing radiolabel binding moieties. Conversely, the thiol-containing radiolabel binding moieties cannot disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the peptide by "scrambling" structurally-important disulfide bonds. In contrast, for example, a thiol-containing Tc-99m binding moiety covalently linked to native somatostatin, or to a somatostatin analogue having a disulfide bond, can result in disulfide bond formation between a sidechain sulfur of a peptide amino aicd and the thiol group of the radiolabel binding moiety. Such "scrambling" of disulfide bonds can be accompanied by a loss of biological activity. The present invention is not subject to similar losses in biological activity in vivo because the non-disulfide cyclic linkages in each of the somatostatin analogues of the invention comprise stable covalent bonds.</p><p>Such loss of biological activity can also occur in vivo using native somatostatin, or to any somatostatin analogue having a disulfide bond. Thus, the peptides of the present invention are per se advantageous as somatostatin analogues over native somatostatin or somatostatin analogues comprising a disulfide bond because they are intrinsically more stable and resistant to chemical oxidation.</p><p>It is another advantage of the somatostatin analogues provided by this invention that the cyclic covalent linkage acts to protect the peptide from degradation by exopeptidases. Further, the cyclic structure confers a degree of conformational rigidity to the peptide that can act to enhance binding of the peptide to its biological target (i.e., the somatostatin receptor).</p><p>A first aspect of the reagents provided by the invention for preparing radiolabeled agents are reagents that are each comprised of a cyclic somatostatin receptor-binding peptide as described above that is covalently linked to a radiolabel-binding moiety having the formula:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->C(pgp).sup.s -(aa)-C(pgp).sup.s</pre></p><p>where (pgp).sup.s is hydrogen or a thiol protecting group and (aa) is an α- or β-amino acid not comprising a thiol group.

The use of the term "cyclo" herein is intended to indicate that the peptide is cyclized by formation of a covalent bond between the atoms of the amino terminal substituted or unsubstituted amino group and the carboxyl terminus of the peptide.</p><p>For the purposes of this invention the term "poly(N-carboxyalkyl)amine" in intended to describe a series of compounds exemplified by nitrilotriacetic acid, iminodiacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenepentaacetic acid (DTPA).</p><p>For the purposes of this invention the term "polyoxyanion" is intended to encompass sulfates, phosphates, sulfonates, phosphonates, and like compounds.</p><p>Somatostatin analogue peptides of the present invention can be chemically synthesized in vitro. Peptides of the present invention can generally advantageously be prepared on a peptide synthesizer. The peptides of this invention can be synthesized wherein the radiolabel-binding moiety is covalently linked to the peptide during chemical synthesis in vitro, using techniques well known to those with skill in the art. Such peptides covalently-linked to the radiolabel-binding moiety during synthesis are advantageous because specific sites of covalent linkage can be determined.</p><p>Radiolabel binding moieties of the invention may be introduced into the target somatostatin analogue peptides during peptide synthesis. For embodiments comprising picolinic acid (designated (Pic-); e.g., Pic-Gly-Cys(protecting group)-), the radiolabel-binding moiety can be synthesized as the last (i.e., amino-terminal) residue in the synthesis. In addition, the picolinic acid-containing radiolabel-binding moiety may be covalently linked to the ε-amino group of lysine to give, for example, αN(Fmoc)-Lys-εN{Pic-Gly-Cys (protecting group)}, which may be incorporated at any appropriate position in the peptide chain. This sequence is particularly advantageous as it affords an easy mode of incorporation into the target somatostatin analogue peptide.</p><p>Similarly, the picolylamine (Pica)-containing radiolabel-binding moiety (-Cys(protecting group)-Gly-Pica) can be prepared during peptide synthesis by including the sequence (-Cys(protecting group)-Gly-) at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide chain. Following cleavage of the peptide from the resin the carboxyl terminus of the peptide is activated and coupled to picolylamine. This synthetic route requires that reactive side-chain functionalities remain masked (protected) and do not react during the conjugation of the picolylamine.</p><p>This invention also provides small synthetic peptides that are somatostatin analogues and incorporate bisamine bisthiol (BAT) chelators that may be labeled with Tc-99m.</p><p>This invention provides for the incorporation of BAT chelators into virtually any position in the peptide, via covalently linkage to any appropriate functional group of the peptide, except that the chelating moieties of the invention are not covalently linked to functional groups comprising the amino acid side chains of the amino acids B.sup.1, B.sup.2, B.sup.3 or B.sup.4 as defined above.</p><p>In forming a complex of radioactive technetium with the reagents of this invention, the technetium complex, preferably a salt of Tc-99m pertechnetate, is reacted with the reagent in the presence of a reducing agent. Preferred reducing agents are dithionite, stannous and ferrous ions; the most preferred reducing agent is stannous chloride. Means for preparing such complexes are conveniently provided in a kit form comprising a sealed vial containing a predetermined quantity of a reagent of the invention to be labeled and a sufficient amount of reducing agent to label the reagent with Tc-99m. Alternatively, the complex may be formed by reacting a reagent of this invention with a pre-formed labile complex of technetium and another compound known as a transfer ligand. This process is known as ligand exchange and is well known to those skilled in the art. The labile complex may be formed using such transfer ligands as tartrate, citrate, gluconate or mannitol, for example. Among the Tc-99m pertechnetate salts useful with the present invention are included the alkali metal salts such as the sodium salt, or ammonium salts or lower alkyl ammonium salts.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a kit for preparing technetium-labeled peptides is provided. An appropriate amount of the peptide reagent is introduced into a vial containing a reducing agent, such as stannous chloride, in an amount sufficient to label the peptide with Tc-99m. An appropriate amount of a transfer ligand as described (such as tartrate, citrate, gluconate or mannitol, for example) can also be included. The kit may also contain conventional pharmaceutical adjunct materials such as, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts to adjust the osmotic pressure, buffers, preservatives and the like. The components of the kit may be in liquid, frozen or dry form. In a preferred embodiment, kit components are provided in lyophilized form.</p><p>Tc-99m labeled imaging reagents according to the present invention may be prepared by the addition of an appropriate amount of Tc-99m or Tc-99m complex into the vials and reaction under conditions described in Example 2 hereinbelow.</p><p>Radioactively-labeled scintigraphic imaging agents provided by the present invention are provided having a suitable amount of radioactivity. In forming Tc-99m radioactive complexes, it is generally preferred to form radioactive complexes in solutions containing radioactivity at concentrations of from about 0.01 millicurie (mCi) to 100 mCi per mL.</p><p>The imaging reagents provided by the present invention can be used for visualizing organs such as the kidney for diagnosing disorders in these organs, and tumors, in particular gastrointestinal tumors, myelomas, small cell lung carcinoma and other APUDomas, endocrine tumors such as medullary thyroid carcinomas and pituitary tumors, brain tumors such as meningiomas and astrocytomas, and tumors of the prostate, breast, colon, and ovaries can also be imaged. In accordance with this invention, the Tc-99m labeled peptide reagents are administered in a single unit injectable dose. The Tc-99m labeled peptide reagents provided by the invention may be administered intravenously in any conventional medium for intravenous injection such as an aqueous saline medium, or in blood plasma medium. Generally, the unit dose to be administered has a radioactivity of about 0.01 mCi to about 100 mCi, preferably 1 mCi to 20 mCi. The solution to be injected at unit dosage is from about 0.01 mL to about 10 mL. After intravenous administration, imaging in vivo can take place in a matter of a few minutes. However, imaging can take place, if desired, in hours or even longer, after the radiolabeled peptide is injected into a patient. In most instances, a sufficient amount of the administered dose will accumulate in the area to be imaged within about 0.1 of an hour to permit the taking of scintiphotos. Any conventional method of scintigraphic imaging for diagnostic purposes can be utilized in accordance with this invention.</p><p>The somatostatin receptor-binding cyclic peptides and non-radioactive metal complexes of the cyclic peptide reagents of the invention may be used clinically as therapeutic agents to promote regression of certain types of tumors, particularly those that express somatostatin receptors. The somatostatin analogue cyclic peptides of the invention can also be used to reduce the hormonal hypersecretion that often accompanies certain cancers, such as the APUDomas. Peptides of the invention used as therapeutic agents may be administered by any appropriate route, including intravenous, intramuscular or by mouth, and in any acceptable pharmaceutical carrier, in doses ranging from about 0.1 to about 49 mg/kg body weight/day.</p><p>This invention also provides peptides radiolabled with cytotoxic radioisotopes such as tin-117m, rhenium-186 or rhenium-188 that may be used for radiotherapy of certain tumors as described above. For this purpose, an amount of radioactive isotope from about 10 mCi to about 200 mCi may be administered via any suitable clinical route, preferably by intravenous injection.</p><p>This invention also provides somatostatin receptor-binding peptides covalently linked to a metal-binding moiety that are complexed with a magnetic, paramagnetic, supermagnetic, or superparamagnetic metal atom, ion or particle, and methods for using such complexes for magnetic-based detection of localization of such somatostatin receptor binding peptide complexes at tumor or other tissue sites in vivo. Thus, the invention provides non-radioactive methods for localizing tumor and other somatostatin receptor expressing tissues in vivo.</p><p>This invention provides methods for using the diagnostic and radiodiagnostic and therapeutic and radiotherpaeutic agents of the invention. For radiolabeled embodiments of the agents of the invention, for example, Tc-99m labeled scintigraphic imaging agents, an effective diagnostic or therapeutic amount of the diagnostic or radiodiagnostic or therapeutic or radiotherapeutic agent of the invention are administered. In radiodiagnostic embodiments, localization of the radiolabel is detected using conventional methodologies such as gamma scintigraphy. In non-radioactive diagnostic embodiments, localization of sites of accumulation of the paramagnetic metal-labeled diagnostic agents of the invention is achieved using magnetic resonance imaging methodologies. The imaging agents provided by the invention have utility for tumor imaging, particularly for imaging primary and metastatic neoplastic sites wherein said neoplastic cells express somatostatin receptors (SSTR), and in particular such primary and especially metastatic tumor cells that have been clinically recalcitrant to detection using conventional methodologies. In addition, the imaging agents of the invention are useful in detecting sites of T lymphocyte accumulation associated with occult disease or pathology, e.g., as occurs in patients suffering from tuberculosis.</p><p>The methods for making and labeling these compounds are more fully illustrated in the following Examples. These Examples illustrate certain aspects of the above-described method and advantageous results, and are shown by way of illustration and not limitation.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading><heading>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis</heading><p>Solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) was carried out on a 0.25 millimole (mmole) scale using an Applied Biosystems Model 431A Peptide Synthesizer and using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino-terminus protection, coupling with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/hydroxybenzotriazole or 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/hydroxybenzotriazole (HBTU/HOBT), and using p-hydroxymethyl henoxymethyl-polystyrene (HMP) resin or Sasrin™ resin for carboxyl-terminus acids or Rink amide resin for carboxyl-terminus amides.</p><p>Where appropriate, the following amino acid derivatives were synthesized. Homocysteine was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of L-homocysteine lactone, or by reduction of L-homocystine using metallic sodium in liquid ammonia. Threoninol residues, wherein the carboxyl group of the amino acid is reduced to a primary alcohol, can be introduced into the peptides of the invention where appropriate using the procedure of Neugebauer et al. (1990, Peptides: Proceedings of the 11th American Peptide Symposium, pp. 1020-21). Fmoc.Hcy(Trt) and Fmoc.Pen(Trt) were prepared from the appropriate amino acids by tritylation with triphenylmethanol in TFA, followed by Fmoc derivitization as described by Atherton et al. (1989, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, IRL Press: Oxford). Fmoc.homohomocysteine(Trt) was prepared by reducing N,N-bis-Boc-glutamic acid-a-methyl ester with borane-THF, followed by mesylation and reaction with trityl-mercaptide, followed by removal of the Boc groups with BF.sub.3 OEt.sub.2 in acetic acid, and then Fmoc derivitization as described above. phenyl-CH.sub.2 CHBrCOOH was prepared by treating phenylalanine (in a solution of water and TFA/saturated with NaBr) with sodium nitrite, followed by distillation to recover the pure product.</p><p>Where appropriate, 2-chloroacetyl, 2-bromoacetyl and 2-bromo-3-phenylpropionyl groups were introduced either by using the appropriate 2-halo acid as the last residue coupled during SPPS, or by treating the N-terminus free amino acid peptide bound to the resin with either 2-halo acid/diisopropylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide/NMP or 2-halo acid anhydride/diisopropylethylamine/NMP.</p><p>Where appropriate, HPLC-purified 2-haloacylated peptides were cyclized by stirring an 0.1-1.0 mg/mL solution in phosphate or bicarbonate buffer or dilute ammonium hydroxide (pH 8.0), optionally containing 0.5-1.0 mM EDTA, or acetonitrile or THF for 1-48 h followed optionally by acidification with acetic acid, lyophilization and HPLC purification.</p><p>Where appropriate, thiol-containing peptides were reacted with chloroacetyl-containing, thiol-protected Tc-99m complexing moieties at pH 10 for 0.5-4 hours at room temperature, followed by acetic acid acidification and evaporation of the solution to give the corresponding peptide-sulfide adduct. Deprotection and purification were routinely performed as described to yield the chelator-peptide conjugate.</p><p>Where appropriate, BSME adducts were prepared by reacting single thiol-containing peptides (5 to 50 mg/mL in DMF buffered to pH 7 with N-methylmorpholine or N-ethyl-morpholine, or 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7-8, optionally containing 0.5 mM EDTA or DMF or THF or acetonitrile) with 0.5 molar equivalents of BMME (bis-maleimidomethylether) pre-dissolved in acetonitrile at room temperature for approximately 1-18 hours.

(1991, Life Sciences 42:1593-1601).</p><p>CA20948 rat pancreatic tumor cells, thawed from frozen harvested tumor brei, were implanted intramuscularly in a suspension of 0.05 to 0.1 mL/animal, into the right hind thigh of 6 week old Lewis rats. The tumors were allowed to grow to approximately 0.5 to 2 g, harvested, and tumor brei was used to implant a second, naive set of Lewis rats. Passaging in this fashion was repeated to generate successive generations of tumor-bearing animals. The tumor-bearing animals used for the in vivo studies were usually from the third to fifth passage and carried 0.2 to 2 g tumors.</p><p>For studies of the specificity of radiotracer localization in the tumors, selected animals were given an subcutaneous SSTR-blocking dose (4 mg/kg) of octreotide 30 minutes prior to injection of the radiotracer. (This protocol has been shown by Bakker et al. to result in a lowering of .sup.111 In-{DTPA}octreotide tumor uptake by 40%.)</p><p>Third- to fifth-passage CA20948 tumor-bearing Lewis rats were restrained and injected intravenously via the dorsal tail vein with a dose of 0.15-0.20 mCi .sup.99m Tc-labeled peptide corresponding to 3 to 8 μg peptide in 0.2 to 0.4 mL.</p><p>At selected times, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and selected necropsy was performed. Harvested tissue samples were weighed and counted along with an aliquot of the injected dose in a gamma well-counter.</p><p>The 90-minute biodistribution results of selected radiolabeled peptides are presented in Table IV. Notably, .sup.99m Tc-P587, .sup.99m Tc-P617, .sup.99m Tc-P726, and .sup.99m Tc-P736 showed very high tumor uptake and tumor/blood ratios demonstrating their high specific uptake in target (tumor) tissue.</p><p>FIG. 1 shows an image of .sup.99m Tc-P587 in a tumor-bearing rat. The high uptake in the tumor in the lower leg (arrow) is clearly visible.</p><p>.sup.99m Tc-P587 uptake in tumors in rats was compared with and without pre-injection treatment with octreotide, a somatostatin analogue known to bind to the somatostatin receptor in vivo. In these experiments, receptor-blocking by administration of octreotide prior to administration of .sup.99m Tc-P587 reduced specific tumor uptake of the radiolabeled peptide by 76%. These results confirmed that binding of .sup.99m Tc-P587 in vivo was SSTR-specific.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE IV__________________________________________________________________________                        % ID/gNo.   Peptides                  Tumor                            T/B                               T/M__________________________________________________________________________P617   cyclo(N-methyl)FYW.sub.D KV.Hcy.(CH.sub.2 CO.GGCR.amide)                        6.7 9.4                               36  P587 cyclo(N-methyl)FYW.sub.D KV.Hcy.(CH.sub.2 CO.GGCK.amide) 3.4 6.0                               33  P829 cyclo.(N--CH.sub.3)FYW.sub.D KV.Hcy(CH.sub.2 CO.(β-Dap)KCK.ami                               de) 2.7 13 49  P832 cyclo.(N--CH.sub.3)FYW.sub.D KV.Hcy(CH.sub.2 CO.(β-Dap)KCR.ami                               de) 2.7 13 37  P625 cyclo.(N-Me)FYW.sub.D KV.Hcy(CH.sub.2 CO.(ε-K)KC.amide)                               0.97 0.85 4.6  P550 KKKK.Nal.sub.D.Cpa.YW.sub.D KTFT(ε-K)GCDDDD.amide 0.74                               0.91 7.4__________________________________________________________________________</pre></p><heading>EXAMPLE 6</heading><heading>In Vivo Imaging of Human Somatostatin Receptor (SSTR)-Expressing Tumors with Tc-99m Labeled P587</heading><p>In a clinical trial, scintigraphic imaging of human patients bearing SSTR-expressing tumors was achieved using the Tc-99m labeled P587 reagent.</p><p>A total of 10 patients, four females and six males ranging in age from 27 to 69 years, had been previously diagnosed with growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma (4 patients), melanoma (1 subject), medullary thyroid cancer (1 subject), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC; 1 patient), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1 patient) or gastric carcinoid (1 patient). Each of these patients were administered Tc-99m labeled P587 at a dose of 10-22 mCi per 0.2-0.5 mg by intravenous injection. Scintigraphic imaging was them performed as described herein on each patient for 4 hours post-injection.</p><p>Gamma camera imaging is started simultaneously with injection. Anterior images were acquired as a dynamic study (10 sec image acquisitions) over the first 10 min, and then as static images at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h post-injection.
