Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relates generally to magenta-colored phase change inks. More particularly, the present invention relates to a phase change ink composition containing the combination of (a) a phase change carrier composition; (b) at least one compatible phase change magenta colorant material; and (c) at least one organic sulfonic acid. Still further, the present invention relates to processes of using these phase change ink compositions in a printing device.</p><p>2. Description of the Relevant Art</p><p>In general, phase change inks (sometimes referred to as "hot melt inks") are in the solid phase at ambient temperature, but exist in the liquid phase at the elevated operating temperature of an ink jet printing device. At the jet operating temperature, droplets of liquid ink are ejected from the printing device and, when the ink droplets contact the surface of the printing media, they quickly solidify to form a predetermined pattern of solidified ink drops. Phase change inks have also been investigated for use in other printing technologies such as gravure printing as referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,879 and German patent publications DE 4205636AL and DE 4205713AL assigned to Siegwerk Farbenfabrik Keller, Dr. Rung and Co.</p><p>Phase change inks for color printing generally comprise a phase change ink carrier composition, which is combined with a phase change ink compatible colorant. Preferably, a colored phase change ink will be formed by combining the above-described ink carrier composition with compatible subtractive primary colorants. The subtractive primary colored phase change inks of this invention can comprise four component dyes, namely, cyan, magenta, yellow and black. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,506; 4,889,761; and 5,372,852 teach that the subtractive primary colorants employed typically may comprise dyes from the classes of Color Index (C.I.) Solvent Dyes, Disperse Dyes, modified Acid and Direct Dyes, and a limited number of Basic Dyes. The colorants can also include pigments as exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,335, assigned to Coates Electrographics LTD. U.S. Pat. No. 5,621,022 issued Apr. 15, 1997, and assigned to Tektronix, Inc., is directed to the use of a specific class of polymeric dyes in phase change ink compositions.</p><p>Phase change inks are desirable for ink jet printers since they remain in a solid phase at room temperature during shipping, long-term storage, and the like. Also, the problems associated with nozzle clogging due to ink evaporation are largely eliminated, thereby improving the reliability of ink jet printing. Furthermore, in the above-noted prior art phase change ink jet printers where the ink droplets are applied directly onto the printing medium and the droplets solidify immediately upon contact with the substrate, migration of ink along the printing medium is prevented and dot quality is improved. This is also true of the processes and ink compositions described herein.</p><p>In addition to the above-referenced U.S. patents, many other patents describe materials for use in phase change ink jet inks. Some representative examples include U. S. Pat. Nos. 3,653,932; 4,390,369; 4,484,948; 4,684,956; 4,851,045; 4,889,560; 5,006,170; and 5,151,120; as well as EP Application Nos. 0187352 and 0206286. These materials can include paraffins, microcrystalline waxes, polyethylene waxes, ester waxes, fatty acids and other waxy materials, fatty amide-containing materials, sulfonamide materials, resinous materials made from different natural sources (tall oil rosins and rosin esters are an example) and many synthetic resins, oligomers, polymers and co-polymers.</p><p>Separately, PCT Patent Application WO 94/14902, which was published on Jul. 7, 1994 and is assigned to Coates Brothers PLC, teaches a hot melt ink containing a colorant and, as a vehicle for the hot melt ink, an oligourethane having a melting point of at least 65 C. and obtained by reacting an aliphatic or aromatic diisocyanate with at least a stoichiometric amount of either: (i) a monohydric alcohol component; or (ii) a monohydric alcohol component followed by another different monohydric alcohol component; or (iii) a monohydric alcohol component, followed by a dihydric alcohol component, followed by a monohydric alcohol component.</p><p>This PCT patent application defines the monohydric alcohol component as either a monohydric aliphatic alcohol (e.g. C.sub.1 to C.sub.22 alcohols), an etherified dihydric aliphatic alcohol (e.g. propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME), dipropylene glycol methyl ether (DPGME), ethylene glycol butyl ether (EGBE), diethylene glycol butyl ether (DPGBE), tripropylene glycol butyl ether (TPGBE) and propylene glycol phenyl ether (PPL)); esterified dihydric aliphatic alcohol (e.g. the esterifying acid may be an ethylenically unsaturated acid (such as acrylic acid or methacrylic acid), thereby introducing ethylenic unsaturation into the oligourethane and rendering it suitable for eventual further additional polymerization (curing) after having been applied to a substrate by hot melt printing), or dihydric polyalkylene glycol. This PCT Application further defined the dihydric alcohol component as a dihydric aliphatic alcohol or a dihydric polyalkylene glycol (e.g. ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500), polypropylene glycol (PPG 750, 1000 and 1500), trimethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, methylpropanediol and 1,6-hexanediol).</p><p>Also, PCT Patent Application WO 94/04619, assigned to the General Electric Company, teaches the use of ionomeric materials in combination with image forming agents to form a hot melt ink jet ink. The ionomeric materials can include many different types of copolymeric or polymeric ionomers, including carboxyl-functional polyurethanes prepared from a diol or polyol and a hydroxyl acid. Many other carrier materials and colorants for the image forming agent of the invention are included in this PCT application.</p><p>Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,942, assigned to the Assignee of the present invention, teaches phase change carrier compositions that comprise the combination of a urethane resin with a urethane/urea resin that may optionally contain other ingredients such as mono-amides and polyethylene waxes. However, that U.S. patent application does not teach or explicitly suggest a phase change carrier composition that contains the combination of three critical ingredients of the carrier compositions of the present invention.</p><p>When certain magenta colorant materials are utilized in phase change inks, several technical problems may arise that may prevent the best use of these materials. First, the magenta color does not develop completely; second, the magenta dye may migrate or "diffuse", thereby degrading print quality over time; and third, the magenta color may darken upon exposure to light. Accordingly, there is a need to solve these problems. The present invention offers a solution to these problems.</p><heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>One aspect of the present invention is directed to phase change ink compositions comprising an admixture of (a) a phase change carrier composition; (b) at least one compatible phase change magenta-colored colorant material; and (c) at least one organic sulfonic acid compound.</p><p>Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method for producing a layer of a phase change colored ink on the surface of a substrate by either direct or indirect printing wherein the phase change ink composition in the solid phase comprises the above-noted admixture.</p><p>Features of the phase change inks of the present invention include more fully developed magenta color; an ink that diffuses less readily; and an ink having more light-stability, when compared to similar inks not containing an organic sulfonic acid compound. It is believed that the sulfonic acid compound or compounds bias certain magenta colorant materials into more stable physical forms which decrease their mobility in the ink matrix and fully develop the color strength of the magenta colorant.</p><p>It is an advantage of the present invention that phase change ink compositions of the present invention have improved stability, utility and quality that make them more desirable for a wider variety of applications.</p><heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>The term "phase change carrier composition" as used in the present specification refers to any combination of suitable materials, other than magenta colorant materials and organic sulfonic acid compounds described below, that may be used in phase change inks. This includes the materials described in the above-noted patents and patent applications. One preferred class of phase change carrier compositions includes isocyanate resin-based carriers described in the above-noted U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,942 and other U.S. Patent Applications assigned to the same assignee. Another preferred class of phase change carriers is the tetra-amide-based carriers described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,560 (Jaeger et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,761 (Titterington et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,852 (Titterington et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,621,022 (Jaeger et al.).</p><p>The phrase "at least one compatible phase change magenta colorant material" as used in the present specification and claims refers to one or more magenta-colored colorant materials that are useful in making phase change inks and are also compatible with the phase change carrier composition also present in the same phase change ink. These magenta colorant materials are "rhodamine-type" magenta colorants as exemplified by dyes such as Solvent Red 49, Solvent Red 127 and the like.</p><p>The term "at least one organic sulfonic acid compound" as used in the present specification and claims refers to any organic compound having one or more sulfonic acid moieties.</p><p>The phase change carrier composition, as stated above, preferably contains any of the isocyanate resin-based carriers described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,942. These include urethane resins, urea resins, and mixed urethane/urea resins made from various isocyanates, alcohols and amines.</p><p>The term "nucleophile" in the present specification and claims is used as defined on page 179 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 3rd Edition by Jerry March,  reagent that brings an electron pair to a reaction to form a new bond. The preferred nucleophiles of this invention are alcohols or amines, but it is understood that other nucleophilic functional groups that are capable of reacting with the isocyanate moiety could also be used in the invention.</p><p>The term "oligomer" in the current specification and claims is used as defined on page 7 of "Polymer Chemistry--The Basic Concepts" by Paul Hiemenz,  term coined to designate molecules for which n (representing the number of repeating monomer units) is less than 10.</p><p>The term "isocyanate-derived resin" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any monomeric, oligomeric or non-polymeric resinous material derived from the reaction of mono-, di-, or poly-isocyanates with suitable nucleophilic molecules.</p><p>The terms "isocyanate-derived wax" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any crystalline or semicrystalline waxy material derived from the reaction of a fatty isocyanate with a suitable nucleophile, or the reaction of a fatty nucleophile with a suitable isocyanate, or the reaction of a fatty nucleophile with a fatty isocyanate.</p><p>The term "urethane resin" or "urethane isocyanate-derived resin" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any resin that is a urethane which is the product of the reaction of an isocyanate and an alcohol.</p><p>The term "mixed urethane/urea resin" or "urethane/urea isocyanate-derived resin" as used in the present specification and claims is defined as any resin that is a mixed urethane/urea which is the product of the reaction of an isocyanate, an alcohol and an amine.</p><p>Any suitable reaction condition for making urethane resins or mixed urethane/urea resins by condensing alcohols and/or amines with isocyanates may be employed in the practice of the present invention. Preferably, the reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures (e.g. about 60 to about 160 such as dibutyltindilaurate, bismuth tris-neodecanoate, cobalt benzoate, lithium acetate, stannous octoate or triethylamine. The reaction conditions preferably are conducted in an inert atmosphere, such as argon or nitrogen gas or other suitable atmosphere, to prevent oxidizing or yellowing the reaction products and to prevent undesirable side reactions. The mole ratio of reactants is adjusted so that the isocyanate functionalities are completely consumed in the reaction with a slight molar excess of alcohol or amine typically remaining. Conceptually the reactants can be added together in any order and/or added to the reaction as physical mixtures. However, in the preferred embodiments of the invention, reaction conditions and the order of the addition of reactants are carefully controlled for several reasons. First, reaction conditions and reactant additions are chosen to provide a controlled exothermic reaction. Secondly, when reacting mixtures of alcohols and/or amines with diisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), the order of addition of the isocyanate and the different nucleophiles to the reaction is chosen to tailor the distribution of diurethane molecules, and/or mixed urethane/urea molecules, and/or diurea molecules in the final resin. When doing this, the different reactivities to isocyanates of alcohols versus amines are employed, as are the different reactivities of the two separate isocyanate groups on IPDI. See J. H. Saunders and K. C. Frisch's "Polyurethanes Part I, Chemistry" published by Interscience of New York, N.Y. in 1962 and Olin Chemicals' Luxate™ IM isophorone diisocyanate technical product information sheet which provide further explanation of this chemistry. This control of the reaction conditions and order of addition of the reactants is done to specifically tailor or customize the different types of molecular species in the finished resin so that the resin will:</p><p>(1) have a controlled viscosity that is designed for a specific application,</p><p>(2) have a controlled glass transition temperature and/or melting point, and</p><p>(3) have consistent properties from batch to batch.</p><p>The isocyanate-derived resins from these reactions are generally transparent solids having melting points in the range of about 20 C. to about 150 about 5000 cPs at 150 about 100 generally opaque waxy solids having sharp melting points from about 50 about 25 cPs at 140 display properties such that the higher the T.sub.g and the melting point, the higher is the viscosity. While the structural activity relationships are not fully understood, it is known that the T.sub.g of the isocyanate-derived resins is controlled by the proper choice of the mixture of nucleophiles in the reaction as illustrated in Table 3 in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,942. Varying one or more of the readily available commodity chemicals used as chemical precursors will permit custom-tailoring of the properties of the isocyanate-derived resin and wax materials.</p><p>Preferred alcohols to react with difunctional and higher isocyanates to make either the urethane resins or the urethane/urea resins of this invention include any monohydric alcohol. For instance, the monohydric alcohol could be any aliphatic alcohol [e.g., a C.sub.1 -C.sub.22 or higher linear alcohol, any branched alcohol or any cyclic aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, (n- and iso)-propanol, (n-, iso-, t-) butanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) pentanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) hexanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) octanol, (n-, iso-, t-, and the like) nonanol, (n- and branched) decanols, (n- and branched) undecanols, (n- and branched) dodecanols, (n- and branched) hexadecanols, (n- and branched) octadecanols, 3-cyclohexyl-1-propanol, 2-cyclohexyl-1-ethanol, cyclohexylmethanol, cyclohexanol, 4-methyl cyclohexanol, 4-ethylcyclohexanol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, and the like]; an aliphatic/aromatic alcohol (e.g., benzyl alcohol, octyl, nonyl, and dodecylphenol alkoxylates of octyl, nonyl, and dodecylphenol, and alkoxyphenol); aromatic alcohols such as phenol, naphthol, and the like, and their derivatives; fused ring alcohols (e.g., rosin alcohols, hydroabietyl alcohol, cholesterol, vitamin E, and the like) and other suitable alcohols (e.g., N,N-dimethyl-N-ethanolamine, stearamide-monoethanolamine, tripropyleneglycol monomethylether, hydroxybutanone, menthol, isoborneol, terpineol, 12-hydroxy stearyl stearamide, and the like).

Of the primary mono-amides, stearamide, such as KEMAMIDE S manufactured by Witco Chemical Company, can be employed herein. As for the secondary mono-amides, behenyl benenamide (KEMAMIDE EX-666) and stearyl stearamide (KEMAMIDE S-180), both manufactured by Witco Chemical Company, are extremely useful mono-amides. However, stearyl stearamide (KEMAMIDE S-180) is the mono-amide of choice in producing the phase change ink compositions of the present invention.</p><p>Also, when an isocyanate-based phase change carrier system is used, the carrier may optionally contain at least one polyethylene wax.</p><p>Preferably, the polyethylene wax has a molecular weight of about 500 to about 5,000; more preferably, of about 700 to about 2,000; and, most preferably, of about 800 to 1,200. Preferred polyethylene waxes are Polywax 850, Polywax 1000 or Polywax 2000, all available from Petrolite.</p><p>Most preferably, the phase change carrier composition comprises (a) a urethane resin that is the reaction product of the reaction of at least one alcohol and an isocyanate, wherein the alcohol is selected from the group consisting of a monohydric aliphatic alcohol, a monohydric aromatic alcohol, a monohydric aliphatic/aromatic alcohol, a monohydric fused ring alcohol, a polyol and mixtures thereof; and/or (b) a mixed urethane/urea resin that is the reaction product of at least one alcohol, an isocyanate, and at least one amine; and (c) at least one mono-amide; and, optionally (d) at least one polyethylene wax.</p><p>Preferably, the total amount of urethane resin or resins in the phase change carrier composition and the inks made therefrom will comprise about 10% to about 40%, more preferably, about 15-35% and most preferably, about 20-30%, by weight of the carrier composition.

The phase change carrier composition is generally designed for use in either a direct printing mode or use in an indirect or offset printing transfer system. In the direct printing mode, the phase change carrier composition is generally made up of one or more chemicals that provide the necessary properties to allow the phase change ink (1) to be applied in a thin film of uniform thickness on the final receiving substrate when cooled to the ambient temperature after printing directly to the substrate; (2) to be ductile while retaining sufficient flexibility so that the applied image on the substrate will not fracture upon bending; and (3) to possess a high degree of lightness, chroma, transparency and thermal stability. In an offset printing transfer or indirect printing mode, the phase change carrier composition is designed to possess not only the above mentioned properties, but certain fluidic and mechanical properties necessary for use in such a system, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,958 which is hereby incorporated by reference in pertinent part. The phase change carrier composition and the inks made therefrom which collectively comprise the current invention can contain a combination of urethane resins and urethane/urea resins, along with two other critical ingredients. These three critical ingredients can be supplemented with (one or more) optional ingredients to prepare commercial phase change carrier compositions. The urethane resins and mixed urethane/urea resin materials of the current invention are tailored to have the desirable properties mentioned above when used in the carrier composition of the inks of the present invention by varying one or more of the readily available commodity chemical precursors.</p><p>The phase change carrier compositions of the current invention producing an improved magenta may be used in combination with certain dyes that are compatible with the carrier. These dyes are generally known as Rhodamine dyes. Examples of this group that are pertinent to this invention are Solvent Red 49 and Solvent Red 127.</p><p>The third critical ingredient of the present invention is at least one organic sulfonic acid compound. Preferably, the organic sulfonic acid compound is an alkyl benzene sulfonic acid. Most preferably, the organic sulfonic acid compound is para-toluene-sulfonic acid or dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid.</p><p>The amount of organic sulfonic acid compound is preferably from about 2% to about 100% by weight of total magenta colorant material in the ink. More preferably, this amount is from about 5% to about 30%, by weight of the total magenta colorant material in the ink. The amount of magenta colorant material in the ink is from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight of the total weight of the ink. A more preferred amount of magenta colorant material in the ink is from about 0.5 to about 5% by weight of the total weight of the ink. The preferred amount of magenta colorant material in the ink is from about 1% to about 3% by weight of the total weight of the ink.</p><p>This invention is also pertinent to the types of phase change inks for use in direct and indirect transfer printing systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,560 and 5,372,852. These inks consist of a phase change ink carrier composition comprising one or more fatty amide-containing materials, usually consisting of a mono-amide wax and a tetra-amide resin, one or more tackifiers, one or more plasticizers and one or more antioxidants, in combination with compatible colorants. A preferred tetra-amide resin is a dimer acid based tetra-amide that is the reaction product of dimer acid, ethylene diamine, and stearic acid. The typical mono-amide is stearyl stearamide. A preferred tackifier resin is a glycerol ester of hydrogenated abietic (rosin) acid and a preferred antioxidant is that provided by Uniroyal Chemical Company under the tradename Naugard 445.</p><p>Many other patents, including the aforementioned representative examples, describe other materials for use in phase change ink jet inks. As described earlier, these other materials can include paraffins, microcrystalline waxes, ester waxes, amide waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty amides and other waxy materials, sulfonamide materials, resinous materials made from different natural sources (tall oil rosins and rosin esters are an example) and many synthetic resins, oligomers, polymers, co-polymers, and ionomers. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the phase change carrier composition of this invention could optionally contain any of the optional other materials.</p><p>The aforementioned U.S. Pat.
