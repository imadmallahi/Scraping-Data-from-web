soft sheet applications and more specifically to thermoplastic polyolefin
compositions for slush molding.</p><heading><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0002">Thermoplastic polyolefin compositions are actively pursued as replacement materials
for polyvinyl chloride based skin materials for the fabrication of many articles. In the
automotive field, thermoplastic polyolefin compositions have been used for the
fabrication of articles such as interior sheathing, including instrument panel skins,
door panels, air bag covers and seat covers.</p><p num="0003">Many of the articles have surface appearances and designs having complex surface
characteristics, such as contours and geometric technical grains, and may be
produced in a slush molding process. However, the balance of material properties
desired for a slush molding process is difficult to achieve with current thermoplastic
polyolefin compositions. Current thermoplastic polyolefin compositions are often
processed for prolonged time periods at extremely high temperatures to form a fused
skin in a slush molding process. The material composition of such a typical
thermoplastic polyolefin composition may degrade during processing which in turn
may alter the material properties, such as the material strength and uniform fusion of
the composition. As a result, articles produced using these thermoplastic polyolefin
compositions may have unacceptable surface appearance and mechanical properties.
To achieve suitability for slush molding without material property degradation, 
thermoplastic polyolefin compositions with a very low melt viscosity during the
molding process are desired. Herein we refer to melt viscosity at any given
temperature as that property measured at low shear rates, such as that defined by zero
shear rate viscosity. The melt viscosity of the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions
for use in slush molding should be, but are not limited to, in the range of 50 Pa.s to
250 Pa.s over the processing temperature range of 180°C to 260°C as measured at
low shear rate such as that applied by parallel plate rheometer</p><p num="0004">Thus there is a need in the art for a thermoplastic polyolefin composition having a
low melt viscosity at the molding temperature for use in slush molding. There is a
further need for a thermoplastic composition having improved material properties,
such as uniform melt fusion, during the slush molding process. There is still further
need to convert the composition into a suitable powder (avg. particle size in the range
of 75µm to 400µm) and/or micropellet form, (avg. particle size in the range of
300µm to 900µm), with a good mechanical flow during the slush molding process.
There is a further need in the art for a process for preparing such a composition for
use in manufacturing automotive and non-automotive articles with improved surface
characteristics and appearance.</p><heading><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0005">Described herein are thermoplastic polyolefin compositions and processes for
preparing the composition, and articles of manufacture prepared from the
composition. In one embodiment, a thermoplastic polyolefin composition is
disclosed comprising a blend of about 20 weight percent (hereafter "wt.%") to about
50 wt.% polypropylene; and about 20 wt.% to about 60 wt.% of a styrenic elastomer,

disclosed are based on the weight of the total composition unless otherwise noted.</p><p num="0006">In an alternative embodiment the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions further
comprise up to about 30 wt.% ethylene copolymer elastomer. In another 
embodiment of the thermoplastic polyolefin, compositions comprise up to about 5

melt flow properties by reducing the surface friction and enhancing the scratch
resistance. In another embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions
comprise up to about 10 wt. % powder flow additive, such as inorganic particulate.
Suitable powder flow additive may include hydrated silicate such as talc and
montmorillonite clay. In an additional embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin
compositions comprise about 1 wt.% to about 4 wt.% stabilizer. In a further
embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions comprise about 1 wt.% to
about 2 wt.% color pigment. The stabilizer and color pigment are present in an
amount effective to impart the desired color intensity and provide long term
durability to the composition and the molded article.</p><p num="0007">In another embodiment, a process for the preparation of a thermoplastic polyolefin
composition is provided comprising melt blending about 20 wt.% to about 50 wt.%
polypropylene; and about 20 wt.% to about 60 wt.% styrenic elastomer. The
resultant compositions may be processed into various forms, including, but not
limited to, pellets, micropellets and powder. In another embodiment, the process
comprises melt blending the forgoing compositions with up to about 30 wt.%
ethylene copolymer elastomer. In an additional embodiment, the process comprises
melt blending the foregoing compositions with up to about 5 wt.% polymer additive,
such as polymer surface modifier. In an additional embodiment, the process
comprises the foregoing compositions with up to about 10 wt.% powder flow
additive, such as inorganic particulate. Suitable powder flow additive may include
hydrated silicate such as talc and montmorillonite clay. In a further embodiment the
process comprises melt blending the foregoing compositions with about 1 wt.% to
about 4 wt.% stabilizer. Alternatively, the process comprises melt blending the
foregoing compositions with about 1wt.% to about 2 wt.% color pigment. In another
embodiment, the process further comprises processing the pellets formed from the 
foregoing compositions to form particles. The particles may be in the form of
powder, micropellet, or a combination of powder and micropellet, or other applicable
form depending on the desired application.</p><p num="0008">In another embodiment, articles of manufacture prepared with the present
compositions are provided.</p><p num="0009">These and other features and advantages will be apparent from the following brief
description of the drawings, detailed description, and appended claims and drawings.</p><heading><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p num="0010">Referring now to the drawings which are meant to be exemplary, not limiting:
<sl><li>Figure 1 is a schematic depiction of a process of compounding thermoplastic
polyolefin composition to form a powder in accordance with the present invention.</li><li>Figure 2 is a schematic depiction of a process of In-line compounding thermoplastic
polyolefin compositions to form particles such as micropellets in accordance with the

preparing the same. The present invention also relates to articles of manufacture
prepared from the compositions. In one embodiment, a thermoplastic polyolefin
composition is disclosed comprising a blend of about 20 wt.% to about 50 wt.%
polypropylene; and about 20 wt. % to about 60 wt.% styrenic elastomer. The melt
viscosity of the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions for use in slush molding
should be, but are not limited to, in the range of 50 Pa.s to 250 Pa.s over the
processing temperature range of 180°C to 260°C as measured at low shear rate such
as that applied by parallel plate rheometer. High Melt Flow Index (as measured
according to ASTM D1238) materials with Melt Flow Index (MFI) greater than
about 20 grams/10 minutes (g/10 min) measured at 230°C employing a 2.16 kilogram 
(kg) weight (&gt;20 g/10 min) are selected to obtain low melt viscosity of the
composition. Also, polymers are selected for blend compatibility and/or miscibility
(mutual solubility) to provide compositions with the desired low melt viscosity and
improved flow properties.</p><p num="0012">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients,
properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the
specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the
term "about". Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical
parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are
approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be
obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the
application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical
parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant
digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.</p><p num="0013">Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad
scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the
specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value,
however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard
deviation found in their respective testing measurements.</p><p num="0014">In an alternative embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions further
comprise up to about 30 wt.% ethylene copolymer elastomer. In another
embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions further comprise up to about
5 wt.% polymer additive, such as polymer surface modifier. In an additional
embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions further comprise up to 10
wt.% powder flow additive, such as inorganic particulate. Suitable powder flow
additive may include hydrated silicate such as talc and montmorillonite clay. In an
additional embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions further comprise
about 1 wt.% to about 4 wt.% stabilizer. In another embodiment, the thermoplastic 
polyolefin compositions further comprise about 1 wt.% to about 2 wt.% color
pigment. Optionally, light stabilizer, UV absorber and other agents may be
incorporated in an amount effective to enhance color retention with solar exposure
during product service.</p><p num="0015">The polypropylene component of the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions
comprises about 20 wt.% to about 50 wt.%, more preferably about 25 wt.% to about
35 wt.%, polypropylene. Suitable polypropylene includes, but is not limited to,
crystalline polypropylene and is intended to include in addition to the homopolymer
those polymers that also contain minor amounts, usually not greater than about 15
wt.% based on the total weight of the polypropylene, of other olefin monomers, for
example ethylene, butene, octene and the like. Suitable polypropylene polymers have
melt flow indices in the range of about 60 to about 1200 grams/10 minutes (g/10min.)
measured at 230°C employing a 2.16 kilogram (kg) weight.</p><p num="0016">The thermoplastic polyolefin compositions further comprise about 20 wt.% to about
60 wt.%, preferably about 25 wt. % to about 45 wt.% styrenic elastomer, usually in
the form of random or block copolymer with a molecular styrene content below 50
wt.% based upon the total weight of the styrenic elastomer and the reminder being
made up of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon polymer or copolymer.</p><p num="0017">The thermoplastic polyolefin compositions may comprise up to about 30 wt. %,
preferably about 15 wt.% to about 25 wt. %, ethylene copolymer elastomer, such as
ethylene-based rubber. Suitable ethylene copolymer elastomers include, but are not
limited to, ethylene-propylene, ethylene-butene, ethylene-octene, ethylene-pentene,
ethylene-hexene copolymers and the like, as well as combinations comprising at least
one of the forgoing ethylene copolymer elastomers, having glass transition
temperatures of about down to -70°C or less. Other suitable ethylene copolymer
elastomers include ethylene-propylene non-conjugated diene copolymer (EPDM).
The non-conjugated dienes contain about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms and have at
least one readily polymerized double bond. The ethylene-propylene copolymer 
elastomer contains about 60 wt.% to about 80 wt.%, usually about 65 wt.% to about
75 wt.% ethylene, based on the total weight of the EPDM. The amount of non-conjugated
diene is generally about 1 wt.% to about 7 wt.%, usually about 2 wt.% to
about 5 wt.%, based on the total weight of the EPDM. Preferably, the ethylene-propylene
copolymer elastomer is EPDM coploymer. Suitable EPDM copolymers
include, but are not limited to, ethylene-propylene-1,4 hexadiene, ethylene-propylene
dicyclopentadiene, ethylene-propylene norbornene, ethylene-propylene-methylene-2-norbomene,
and ethylene-propylene-1,4-hexadiene/norbornadiene copolymer.</p><p num="0018">The thermoplastic polyolefin compositions may further optionally comprise up to
about 5 wt.% polymer additive. Suitable polymer additives include polymer surface
modifier to improve scratch resistance, such as fatty acid amides like oleamide and
erucamide, and siloxane. The thermoplastic polyolefin compositions may be
comprised of up to about 5 wt. %, preferably about 0.3% to about 1 wt.%, of polymer
surface modifier.</p><p num="0019">In an additional embodiment, the thermoplastic polyolefin compositions further
comprise up to 10 wt.%, preferably about 3 wt.% to about 7 wt.%, powder flow
additive, such as inorganic particulate. Suitable powder flow additive includes
hydrated silicate such as talc and montmorillonite clay. The particle size range of the
silicate should be in the range of about 1 to about 40µm and preferably in the range
of about 1 to about 20µm.</p><p num="0020">The thermoplastic polyolefin compositions can also optionally comprise stabilizer,
such as heat stabilizer, light stabilizer and the like, as well as combinations
comprising at least one of he foregoing stabilizers. Heat stabilizers include
phenolics, hydroxyl amines, phosphates, ands the like, as well as combinations
comprising at least one of the foregoing heat stabilizers. Light stabilizers include low
molecular weight (having number-average molecular weights less than about 1,000
AMU) hindered amines, high molecular weight (having number-average molecular 
weights greater than about 1,000 AMU) hindered amines, and the like, as well as
combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing light stabilizers. Optionally,
various additives known in the art may be used as needed to impart various properties
to the composition, such as heat stability, stability upon exposure to ultraviolet
wavelength radiation, long term durability, and processability. The exact amount of
stabilizer is readily empirically determined by the reaction employed and the desired
characteristics of the finished article, having about 1 wt.% to about 4 wt.%,
preferably about 1 wt.% to about 3 wt.%, stabilizer.</p><p num="0021">Table 1 provides a list of components suitable for use in the thermoplastic
compositions and examples discussed herein. It will be understood that the

pigment or a combination of color pigments. Suitable color pigments are known to
those skilled in the art and the exact amount of color pigment is readily empirically
determined based on the desired color characteristic of the formulation and the
finished product, with about 1 wt.% to about 2 wt.% possible.</p><p num="0023">The thermoplastic polyolefin composition may be prepared by melt blending the
ingredients under high shear conditions, for example, using an internal mixer, such as
Banbury type mixer, or by using a twin-screw extruder with screw elements selected
to provide high shear for good distributive mixing of components. The resulting
compositions may be processed further into smaller particles, such as pellets,
micropellets, or powder, or any suitable form. The smaller particles of the
compositions are particularly useful for slush molding to achieve uniform skin
formation.</p><p num="0024">In one embodiment, as shown in Figure 1, the process depicted as reference numeral
10, comprises forming the thermoplastic polyolefin ingredients 12, into pellets 16 by
melt mixing 14 the ingredients 12. Melt mixing 14 may be accomplished by using an
extruder, such as a twin screw extruder or an internal mixer, such as a Banbury type
mixer. The pellets 16 may then undergo cryogenic pulverization 18 (pulverized at
cryogenic temperature) to produce a powder 19, with an average particle size of
about 75 to about 500 µm. Cryogenic pulverization 18 is a shearing/impact process
which makes non-uniform particles. In an alternative embodiment, not shown herein,
the process includes melt mixing the components using an extruder, such as a twin 
screw extruder, and further processing the resulting pellets 16 with an extruder, such
as a single screw extruder, to produce micropellets 29.</p><p num="0025">In another embodiment, as shown in Figure 2, the process, as depicted as reference
numeral 20, comprises forming micropellets 29, of the composition using a gear
pump 26 as a means to achieve high backpressure from the twin-extruder 24 to the
minibead die plate, which would eliminate a separate processing step. In this process
20, the ingredients 22 are melt compounded by in-line extrusion, using an extruder,
such as a twin screw extruder 24 with a gear pump 26 to increase the melt pressure.
The resulting composition is then formed into micropellets 29 of the composition, in
a micropellitizer 27. Micropellets 29 of the composition may be processed in a dryer
28, such as a centrifugal dryer.</p><p num="0026">Micropellets 29 of the composition may be larger spherical particles than cryoground
powder 19 particles, usually measuring in the range of about 350 to about 900 µm.
Slush molding can be achieved using either the cryoground powder 19, the
micropellets 29 of the composition or combinations of the two for forming articles of
manufacture therefrom.</p><p num="0027">The process of slush molding may be successful when the powder 19 and/or
micropellets 29 possess good mechanical flow within the forming tool during the
rotation cycle. This property of mechanical flow can be quantified by measuring the
time to empty a cup with an orifice at the bottom and with specific volume. The
improved flow can be achieved by the addition of suitable powder flow additive such
as inorganic particulate. Suitable powder flow additive includes hydrated silicate
such as talc and montmorillonite clay. The powder flow additive may comprise up to
about 10 wt. %, preferably about 3 wt.% to about 7 wt.%, of the total weight of the
thermoplastic polyolefin composition. The particle size range of the silicate should
be in the range of about 1 to about 40µm and preferably in the range of about to
about 20µm. These powder flow additive may be added during the melt 
compounding or as a secondary process during cryogrinding or mechanical mixing of
the powder 19 and/or micropellets 29 with the powder flow additive.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLES</b></heading><p num="0028">The following examples illustrate the present invention. It is understood that these

incompletely fused rough back surface. Mixtures of the micropellets 29 and powder
19 in the composition with ranges of about 20 wt.% to about 80 wt.% of the
micropellets 29 produced skin with improved surface quality and reduced pinholes.</p><p num="0035"><u style="single">Example 4:</u> Composition D was prepared by melt mixing 14 using a twin-screw
extruder and converted by cryogenic pulverization 18 into powder 19 using the
scheme shown in Figure 1. The composition of D, in weight percent of total
composition, comprises about 40 wt.% polypropylene, about 30 wt.% ethylene
copolymer elastomer, and about 30% styrene copolymer elastomer.</p><p num="0036">To this composition was also added about 2 wt.% of a polymer surface modifiers and
about 4 wt.% of a color concentrate consisting of stabilizers and colorants. The final
composition D had a measured melt viscosity of 743 Pa.s (7430 Poise) at 215°C. The

pinholes.</p><p num="0037">Using the Ford 5-Finger Test for Unpainted Slush Molded Samples, with a 1mm tip
and applied loads of 2 to 7N, the skin had a scratch resistance rating of 1. This rating
corresponds to no visible scratch mark.</p><p num="0038"><u style="single">Example 5:</u> Composition E was prepared by melt mixing 14 using a twin-screw
extruder and converted by cryogenic pulverization 18 into powder 19 using the
scheme shown in Figure 1. The composition of E, in weight percent of total 
composition, comprises about 30 wt.% polypropylene, about 40 wt.% ethylene
coploymer elastomer, and about 30 wt.% styrene copolymer elastomer.</p><p num="0039">To this composition was also added about 2 wt. % of polymer surface modifier and
about 4% of a color concentrate consisting of stabilizers and colorants. To the
powder 19 was added about 4 wt.% of a hydrated silicate. The resulting powder had
a measured flow of 6 seconds in a "Cup No. 5".</p><p num="0040">The final composition E had a measured melt viscosity of 650 Pa.s (6500 Poise) at
215°C. The surface quality of a slush molded skin was found to be good with
minimal surface pinholes.</p><p num="0041">Using the Ford 5-Finger Test for Unpainted Slush Molded Samples, with a 1mm tip
and applied loads of 2 to 7N, the skin had a scratch resistance rating ranging from 1-2.
