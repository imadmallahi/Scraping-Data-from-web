These polyisobutenyl sulfonates have improved viscometric properties, particularly low and high temperature viscosity and are useful detergents and high molecular weight dispersants in lubricating oil compositions.</p><heading><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading><p num="p0002">Sulfonates are a class of chemicals used in household, industrial, and institutional cleaning applications, personal care and agricultural products, metalworking fluids, industrial processes, emulsifying agents, corrosion inhibitors and as additives in lubricating oils. Some of the desirable properties of sulfonates for use in lubricating oil applications include their low cost, compatibility, water tolerance, corrosion inhibition, emulsion performance, friction properties, high temperature stability, rust performance, and light color.</p><p num="p0003">Sulfonates that are used in lubricating oil applications have been classified as either neutral sulfonates, low overbased (LOB) sulfonates, or high overbased (HOB) sulfonates. In the past, natural sulfonates, made as a by-product of white oil and process oil production, dominated the sulfonate market. However, as refineries switched to hydrotreating processes, which gave improved yields of process oils and white oils, and as the desire for higher utilization of raw materials and thus improved economics grew, synthetic sulfonates have become more readily available. Synthetic sulfonates now have a major market and have been prepared from synthetic sulphonic acids which have in turn been prepared for example by the sulphonation of C<sub>12</sub> to C<sub>60</sub>+ alkyl substituted benzene, or xylene or toluene compounds and mixtures thereof. It has been found that some synthetic sulphonic acids are difficult to neutralize, for<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> example magnesium hydroxide or lime, to produce sulfonates which have acceptable properties; the attempted neutralization results in the production of gelatinous products which for example can be solid at room temperature. Many synthetic sulfonates have been produced from sulfonated polyalkyl aromatic compounds; see for example <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4764295A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,764,295</text></patcit>. Numerous methods and compositions have been developed to improve the overall viscometric property of these sulfonates, see for example <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5939594A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,939,594</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US6054419A" status="new"><text>6,054,419</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US6204226B" status="new"><text>6,204,226</text></patcit>.</p><p num="p0004">Polyalkenyl sulfonates and processes for their preparation are known in the art. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US3954849A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 3,954,849</text></patcit> discloses a two step process for preparing a mixture of alkenyl sulfonic acids wherein the alkenyl group is a propene or butene polymers having a number average molecular weight of 250 to 500. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4105647A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,105,647</text></patcit> discloses a process for sulfonating polymers which are prepared by solution polymerization using Friedel-Crafts of Ziegler-type catalyst. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US4157432A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,157,432</text></patcit> discloses of a sulfonation process employing homopolymers and copolymers which may contain a high level of olefinic unsaturation, typically internal unsaturation in the polymer backbone. <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6410491B" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,410,491</text></patcit> discloses a method for making a polyalkenyl sulfonates wherein the polyalkenyl sulfonic acid is derived from a mixture of polyalkene comprising greater than 20 mole percent alkyl vinylidene and 1,1-dialkyl isomers and polyisobutene sulfonates derived therefrom U.S Patent Nos. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US6632781B" status="new"><text>6,632,781 </text></patcit>and <patcit id="pcit0010" dnum="US7012045B" status="new"><text>7,012,045</text></patcit> disclose particular applications which employ this polyisobutenyl sulfonate. The degree of reactivity, oil solubility, detergency effect and viscosity behavior are influenced by the polyisobutene characteristics. The high percent alkyl vinylidene polyisobutene of <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="US6410491B" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,491</text></patcit> is typically made with a BF<sub>3</sub> catalyst and commonly contains a polydispersity of about 1.65 to about 2.0. Thus, these polyisobutylenes (although containing a high proportion of reactive end groups) contain a range of molecular weights within the distribution. The large molecular weight distribution is a consequence of the polyisobutene reaction type and leads to a comparatively high molecular non-uniformity of these polyisobutene sulfonates. It has been showed herein, that this relatively large molecular weight distribution (range of low molecular weight to high molecular weight polyisobutenyl sulfonate) impacts the overall viscosity behavior and low temperature viscosity performance. Polyisobutenyl<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sulfonates having a relatively narrow distribution of molecular weight and have a high methyl-vinylidene end group may be prepared for example by cationic quasi-living polymerization of isobutene.</p><p num="p0005">The present invention is directed in part to the unexpected discovery that polyisobutene sulfonates having a high proportion of reactive end groups and having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution lead to improved viscometrics, particularly in kinematic viscosity (kv), intrinsic viscosity, and in low temperature performance such as that demonstrated in the cold cranking simulator (CCS).</p><heading><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="p0006">The present invention provides for polyisobutenyl sulfonates, methods for preparing them, and composition employing them; wherein said polyisobutenyl sulfonates have improved low temperature and high temperature viscometric properties. The polyisobutenyl sulfonates are prepared by sulfonating polyisobutene and reacting the polyisobutenyl sulfonate with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, wherein the polyisobutene is characterized by having at least 90 mole percent methyl-vinylidene, a number average molecular weight of about 350 to 5,000, and a ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub> of from about 1.01 to about 1.4. Polyisobutene having these characteristics can be prepared by cationic quasi-living polymerization with end group functionalization. More specifically, disclosed is a process for preparing a polyisobutenyl sulfonate comprising:
<ol><li>a. polymerizing isobutene in a quasi-living polymer system to form a quasi-living carbocationically terminated polymer comprising contacting an isobutene monomer with an initiator in the presence of a Lewis Acid and solvent, under suitable quasi-living polymerization reaction conditions to obtain a polymer having a number average molecular weight of about 350 to 5,000, and a ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub> of less than about 1.4;</li><li>b. contacting the polymer prepared in step a) with a suitable quenching agent whereby said quenching agent converts the quasi-living<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> carbocationically terminated polymer to a polyisobutene polymer having at least 90 mole percent methyl-vinylidene content;</li><li>c. reacting the polyisobutene polymer of step b) with a sulfonating agent in a ratio of 0.9 to 1.2 and thereafter neutralizing with a source of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.</li> </ol></p><p num="p0007">The quasi-living polymer system used to form a quasi-living carbocationically terminated polymer is formed by contacting an isobutene monomer with an initiator in the presence of a Lewis Acid and solvent, under suitable quasi-living polymerization reaction conditions to obtain a quasi-living carbocationically terminated polymer. Suitable quasi-living carbocationically terminated polymers can be formed by ionizing a polyolefin chain end, commonly halides, in the presence of a Lewis acid and a solvent under suitable quasi-living polymerization reaction conditions. This quasi-living carbocationically terminated polymer polymerization monomer is conducted with a quenching agent under suitable conditions to enable the quenching agent to interact with the reactive chain end of the polyolefin and facilitate the removal of a proton from the reactive chain end, thereby forming the methyl-vinylidene end group. Thus, selecting suitable quenching reaction system conditions (temperature, Lewis Acid, solvent) can optimize conversion to the desired vinylidene terminated polymer. Preferably, conversion is greater that 90 mole % and even up to 100 mole % when compared to a control at the same conditions in the absence of a quenching agent; and thus the polyisobutene polymer product can have a high methyl-vinylidene content. These preferred polyisobutene typically have a methyl-vinylidene content of greater than 90 mole %, preferably greater than 95 mole %, such as having at least 98 to 100 mole % with a narrow polydispersity of less than 1.4, preferably less than 1.3 to about 1.01, and more preferably about 1.1 or less. Preferred number average molecular weights of the above are from 350 to 5,000; with low molecular weights of less than 550, middle molecular weights form 550 to 1,000, and higher molecular weights such as greater than 1,000, more like greater than 2,000, being preferred within the range.</p><p num="p0008">An aspect of the present invention is directed to a polyisobutenyl sulfonic acid composition obtained by reacting: a polyisobutene characterized by having at least 90<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> mole percent methyl-vinylidene, a number average molecular weight of about 350 to 5,000, and a ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub> of less than about 1.4; with a sulfonating agent. The polyisobutenyl sulfonic acid of this invention can be neutralized and/or overbased to provide a polyisobutenyl sulfonate, which for example can be used in a lubricating oil composition and useful as a detergent.</p><p num="p0009">A further aspect of the present invention is directed to a polyisobutenyl sulfonates which are useful as ionic dispersants in preventing sludge and varnish in an internal combustion engine and preventing viscosity increase due to soot in diesel engines. In general it has been determined that low molecular weight polyisobutenyl sulfonates, less than 500 (such as from about 350 -500) molecular weight act primarily as detergents, and high molecular weight polyisobutenyl sulfonates, greater than 2,000 (such as from about 2,000 to 5,000) molecular weight act as ionic dispersants. Intermediate molecular weights may act in both ways. In this regard, the present invention is directed to the use of a polyisobutenyl sulfonate as an ionic dispersant in a lubrication oil composition and more preferably to those employing the higher molecular weights. Particularly preferred polyisobutenyl sulfonates are derived from sulfonation of polyisobutene that is characterized by having at least 90 mole percent methyl-vinylidene, a number average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 5,000, and a ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub> of from about 1.01 to about 1.4; followed by neutralization with an ashless base such as ammonium hydroxide, tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide, tetra-n-butyl ammonium hydroxide or with a alkali metal such as sodium or potassium.</p> <heading><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </heading> <p num="p0010">The polyisobutene having a reactive end group or exo-olefin end group of at least 90% and a polydispersity Mw/Mn of &lt; 1.4 can be conveniently prepared by a quasi-living polymerization reaction of isobutylene followed by quenching. Wherein the term "quasi-living polymerization" as used herein refers to living polymerizations wherein reversible chain terminations is operable, but the rates of irreversible chain termination and chain transfer approach zero and the term "quenching agent" as used herein refers to a chemical compound which is added to a polymerization reaction to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> react with the polymer chain end in the presence of an active Lewis acid. The quenching agent facilitates the removal of a proton from the reactive chain end. Quasi-living polymerization is has been referred to as living polymerization and is known in the art (although true living polymerization refers to polymerizations that proceed in the absence of measurable chain transfer and chain termination) using a variety of systems, some of which are described in <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="US5350819A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat.

The quasi-living polymerization may be conducted as a batch process, a continuous process, a semi-batch process or by any process known by persons skilled in the art. The polymerization reaction is typically carried out under inert gas and in a substantially anhydrous environment.</p><p num="p0012">The reactor is charged with the following reactants:
<ol><li>1. a diluent,</li><li>2. an initiator,</li><li>3. an electron donor or common ion salt, or its precursor,</li><li>4. one or more monomers, and</li><li>5. a Lewis acid, which typically comprises a halide of titanium or boron;

The reaction mixture is equilibrated at the desired temperature, ranging from about -130° C to about 10° C. The method of the present invention may be carried out at any desired pressure, atmospheric, sub-atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure.

Preferably, the reactor contents are stirred or agitated to achieve an even reactant distribution therein. Heterogeneous quenching agents can be effectively contacted with the quasi-living polymer using fixed bed and slurry reactors where the quenching agent is prepared as dispersion or in a fixed medium. The preferred mode of reaction is a batch process although theoretically a plug flow reactor may have process advantages. Typically, the reaction(s) are conducted in the liquid phase for ease of handling and to induce linear or chain type polymerization in contradistinction to ring or branch formation. If a feed is used which is gaseous under ambient conditions, it is preferred to control the reaction pressure and/or dissolve the feed in an inert solvent or liquid diluent, in order to maintain the feed in the liquid phase. For butane feeds, typical C<sub>4</sub> cuts comprising the feed are liquid under pressure and/or low temperatures and do not need a solvent or diluent. The temperature at which the reactions are carried out is important; depending upon the living or quasi-living system, too high a reaction temperature can diminish or eliminate the living character of the cationic polymerization.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></li><li>Compounds suitable for use in the preparation of the polyolefin polymers of the present invention are given below:</li></ul></li></ol></p><heading><u style="single">Diluents</u></heading><p num="p0013">Diluents influence the ionization equilibrium and rates of exchange of growing species through their polarity, which can be estimated from their dielectric constants.

The quenching agents of the present invention are capable of converting quasi-living carbocationically terminated<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> polyolefin tert-chloride chain ends to the exo-olefin chain ends. Without being bound by any theory, for example, it is believed that for polyisobutylene, quenching agents of the present invention selectively catalyze the elimination of a proton from the gem-dimethyl carbon of the polyisobutylene chain end as shown below.
<chemistry id="chem0001" num="0001"><img id="ib0001" orientation="unknown" wi="155" img-format="tif" img-content="chem" file="imgb0001.tif" inline="no" he="44"/></chemistry></p><p num="p0022">This result was unexpected since the agents with very similar structures are known in the prior art to quench quasi-living cationic polymerizations by an electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) mechanism as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0016" dnum="US6969744B" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 6,969,744</text></patcit>. Compounds which provide the highest EAS yields are typically substituted with electron donating groups located at strategic positions on the ring. It is believed that these substituents provide stabilization for the Friedel-Craft intermediates formed when, for example, polyisobutylene carbenium ions react with olefins in the ring.</p><p num="p0023">The quenching agents used in the present invention can be employed to convert polyisobutene polymer containing tert-halide chain ends to the exo-olefin chain ends independently of whether a mono-functional or a multi-functional is used. This rate of conversion is expected to be similar for mono-functional and di-functional initiators. Temperature dependence is observed for the preparation of the polyisobutylene polymers containing a high concentration of exo-olefin chain ends based on the total chain ends. It has been determined that raising the reaction temperature increases the yield of exo-olefin by suppressing coupling. Coupling is seen as a peak centered at 4.82 just up-field from the exo-olefin peak at 4.85 parts per million peak in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum and also in the GPC spectrum, represented by a low elution volume shoulder on the main peak.</p><p num="p0024">In one aspect, the conditions and systems for quasi-living polymerization conditions can be optimized in light of the subsequent quenching step. Without being bound by<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> any theory, it is believed that the desired elimination reaction is in competition with the production of coupled product through reaction of the carbenium ion with already-formed exo-olefin. Therefore conditions that favor elimination and disfavor coupling are preferred. Higher reaction temperature has been found to favor elimination and disfavor coupling. In quasi-living cationic polymerization of isobutylene, an equilibrium exists between active, carbenium ions and dormant, tert-chloride chain ends. When the temperature of the system is raised, this equilibrium increasingly favors the dormant chain ends, but this should decrease the rates of elimination and coupling to an equal extent. However, higher temperature also should displace the equilibrium for the complex between quenching agent and Lewis acid toward un-complexed quenching agent, which is believed to be the agent that causes elimination Raising the temperature thus provides a competitive advantage to the desired reaction. Temperature cannot be increased without limit. In fact, for certain quenching agents, the enthalpy of the quenching agent-Lewis acid complexation equilibrium is so strongly negative in the forward direction, that the quencher is only effective at higher temperatures and totally ineffective at lower temperatures. Thus, in general, the quenching process is beneficially carried out at higher temperatures; although, temperature cannot be increased without limit.</p><p num="p0025">Chain-end concentration and its relationship to quenching agent concentration and Lewis acid concentration are important variables. Higher chain-end concentrations, which become necessary when low molecular weights are targeted, preferentially favor olefin coupling since that process is second order in polymer chains. Therefore, to maintain the desired dominance of the rate of elimination, quenching agent concentration and/or temperature should be increased. Both of these changes, however, have the undesirable effect of reducing the concentration of carbenium ions and thus retarding the conversion of chain ends to exo-olefin. Increasing quenching agent concentration diminishes the concentration of Lewis acid possibly through the formation of a complex between quenching agent and Lewis acid, and this would diminish the carbenium ion concentration since the latter varies approximately with the square of the Lewis acid concentration. Therefore, recipes targeting low molecular weight should be formulated with higher quenching agent concentrations and higher Lewis acid concentrations and preferably run at higher temperatures. An expedient<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> way to reduce coupling at any target molecular weight is to dilute all reactants with additional diluent.</p><p num="p0026">It has been found that in the presence of sufficient concentrations of a basic electron donor, improved conversions to exo-olefin chain ends can be attained when the quenching agent concentration is but a fraction of the quasi-living chain end concentration. This suggests that under these conditions, the quenching agent may remove a proton from the carbenium ion and subsequently transfers the proton to the electron donor. That is, the quenching agent may act as a catalyst for elimination, and the electron donor may serve as a proton acceptor. The use of a less-than-stoichiometric concentration (relative to chain ends) of quenching agent could confer economic advantages in practicing the method the present invention. On the other hand, in the absence of a basic electron donor, for example, when the latter is replaced by a common ion salt or its precursor, it has been found that complete conversion of the chain ends to exo-olefin requires a stoichiometric or higher concentration of quenching agent. Under these conditions the quenching agent may serve as both catalyst and proton acceptor.</p><p num="p0027">Suitable quenching agents are known in the art. U.S. Patent Application Pub.

The source of -<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> SO<sub>3</sub>- can be a mixture of sulfur trioxide and air, sulfur trioxide hydrates, sulfur trioxide amine complexes, sulfur trioxide ether complexes, sulfur trioxide phosphate complexes, acetyl sulfate, a mixture of sulfur trioxide and acetic acid, sulfamic acid, alkyl sulfates or chlorosulfonic acid. The reaction may be conducted neat or in any inert anhydrous solvent. The conditions for sulfonation are not critical. Reaction temperatures can range from -30°C to 200°C and depends on the particular sulfonating agent employed. For example, acetyl sulfate requires low temperatures for reaction and elevated temperatures should be avoided to prevent decomposition of the product. Reaction time can vary from a few minutes to several hours depending on other conditions, such as reaction temperature. The extent of the reaction can be determined by titration of sulfonated polyisobutene after any free sulfuric acid has been washed out. Typical mole ratios of polyisobutene to sulfonating agent can be about 0.9 to 1.2.</p><p num="p0040">The preferred sulfonating agent is acetyl sulfate (or a mixture of sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride which forms acetyl sulfate in situ) which produces the polyisobutenyl sulfonic acid directly. Other sulfonating agents, such as a mixture of sulfur trioxide and air, may produce a sultone intermediate that needs to be hydrolyzed to the sulfonic acid. This hydrolysis step can be very slow.</p><p num="p0041">The polyisobutenes have a number average molecular weight in the range of about 350 to about 5000. Polyisobutenes having number average molecular weights of about 550, 1000 or 2300 are particularly useful. The polyisobutenes employed in the invention have a high degree of exo-olefin or methyl-vinylidene having at least 90 mole percent, preferably at least 95 and more preferably having at least 98 to 100 mole percent methyl-vinylidene. Likewise, the polyisobutenes employed have a narrow molecular weight distribution (M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>), preferably less than about 1.4, more preferably of about 1.01 to about 1.3, and most preferably 1.2 or less.</p><p num="p0042">The polyisobutenyl sulfonates of this invention are prepared by reacting the polyisobutenyl sulfonic acid (prepared as described above) with a source of an alkali or alkaline earth metal. The alkali or alkaline earth metal can be introduced into the sulfonate by any suitable means. One method comprises combining a basically<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> reacting compound of the metal, such as the hydroxide, with the polyisobutenyl sulfonic acid. This is generally carried out in the presence of a hydroxylic promoter such as water, alcohols such as 2-ethyl hexanol, methanol or ethylene glycol, and an inert solvent for the sulfonate, typically with heating. Under these conditions, the basically reacting compound will yield the metal sulfonate. The hydroxylic promoter and solvent can then be removed to yield the metal sulfonate.</p><p num="p0043">Under certain circumstances, it may be more convenient to prepare an alkali metal polyisobutenyl sulfonate and convert this material by metathesis into an alkaline earth metal sulfonate. Using this method, the sulfonic acid is combined with a basic alkali metal compound such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. The sodium or potassium sulfonate obtained can be purified by aqueous extraction. Then, the sodium or potassium sulfonate is combined with an alkaline earth metal salt to form the alkaline earth metal sulfonate. The most commonly used alkaline earth metal compound is a halide, particularly a chloride. Typically, the sodium or potassium sulfonate is combined with an aqueous chloride solution of the alkaline earth metal and stirred for a time sufficient for metathesis to occur. Thereafter, the water phase is removed and the solvent may be evaporated, if desired.</p><p num="p0044">The preferred low molecular weight polyisobutenyl sulfonates having a molecular weight of less than 1000 are derived from alkaline earth metals, especially those of calcium, barium and magnesium; with calcium and magnesium being the most preferred. For the high molecular weight polyisobutenyl sulfonate ionic dispersants, having a molecular weight of greater than 2,000 are preferably derived from alkali metals, prefereabley sodium and potassium.</p><p num="p0045">In another fashion the polyisobutenyl sulfonic acid can be neutralized with an ashless base, such as ammonium hydroxide, tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide, tetra-n-butyl ammonium hydroxide. Ashless polyisobutylene sulfonate having molecular weight of 350 to 5000 with 2,000 to 5,000 are particularly preferred.</p><p num="p0046">The polyisobutenyl sulfonates of this invention are either neutral or overbased sulfonates. Overbased materials are characterized by a metal content in excess of that<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> which would be present according to the stoichiometry of the metal cation in the sulfonate said to be overbased. Thus, a monosulfonic acid when neutralized with an alkaline earth metal compound, such as a calcium compound, will produce a normal sulfonate containing one equivalent of calcium for each equivalent of acid. In other words, the normal metal sulfonate will contain one mole of calcium for each two moles of the monosulfonic acid.</p><p num="p0047">By using well known procedures, overbased or basic complexes of the sulfonic acid can be obtained. These overbased materials contain amounts of metal in excess of that required to neutralize the sulfonic acid. Highly overbased sulfonates can be prepared by the reaction of overbased sulfonates with carbon dioxide under reaction conditions.
