The invention also relates to the preparation and use of these benzimidazole analogs in the treatment of diabetes, and other diseases where the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, control of blood glucose levels, reduction in glycogen stores, or reduction in insulin levels is beneficial.</p><heading>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION</heading><p>Diabetes mellitus (or diabetes) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world today. Diabetes patients have been divided into two classes, namely type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type II or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetics and is estimated to affect 12-14 million adults in the U. S. alone (6.6% of the population). NIDDM is characterized by both fasting hyperglycemia and exaggerated postprandial increases in plasma glucose levels. NIDDM is associated with a variety of long-term complications, including microvascular diseases such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease. Numerous studies in animal models demonstrate a causal relationship between long term complications and hyperglycemia. Recent results from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the Stockholm Prospective Study demonstrate this relationship for the first time in man by showing that insulin-dependent diabetics with tighter glycemic control are at substantially lower risk for development and progression of these complications. Tighter control is also expected to benefit NIDDM patients.</p><p>Current therapies used to treat NIDDM patients entail both controlling lifestyle risk factors and pharmaceutical intervention. First-line therapy for NIDDM is typically a tightly-controlled regimen of diet and exercise since an overwhelming number of NIDDM patients are overweight or obese (≈67%) and since weight loss can improve insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and lead to normoglycemia. Normalization of blood glucose occurs in less than 30% of these patients due to poor compliance and poor response. Patients with hyperglycemia not controlled by diet alone are subsequently treated with oral hypoglycemics or insulin. Until recently, the sulfonylureas were the only class of oral hypoglycemic agents available for NIDDM. Treatment with sulfonylureas leads to effective blood glucose lowering in only 70% of patients and only 40% after 10 years of therapy. Patients that fail to respond to diet and sulfonylureas are subsequently treated with daily insulin injections to gain adequate glycemic control.</p><p>Although the sulfonylureas represent a major therapy for NIDDM patients, four factors limit their overall success. First, as mentioned above, a large segment of the NIDDM population do not respond adequately to sulfonylurea therapy (i.e. primary failures) or become resistant (i.e. secondary failures). This is particularly true in NIDDM patients with advanced NIDDM since these patients have severely impaired insulin secretion. Second, sulfonylurea therapy is associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes. Third, chronic hyperinsulinemia has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease although this relationship is considered controversial and unproven. Last, sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, which leads to worsening of peripheral insulin sensitivity and thereby can accelerate the progression of the disease.</p><p>Recent results from the U.K. Diabetes prospective study also showed that patients undergoing maximal therapy of a sulfonylurea, metformin, or a combination of the two, were unable to maintain normal fasting glycemia over the six year period of the study. U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study 16. Diabetes, 44:1249-158 (1995). These results further illustrate the great need for alternative therapies. Three therapeutic strategies that could provide additional health benefits to NIDDM patients beyond the currently available therapies, include drugs that would: (i) prevent the onset of NIDDM; (ii) prevent diabetic complications by blocking detrimental events precipitated by chronic hyperglycemia; or (iii) normalize glucose levels or at least decrease glucose levels below the threshold reported for microvascular and macrovascular diseases.</p><p>Hyperglycemia in NIDDM is associated with two biochemical abnormalities, namely insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. The relative roles of these metabolic abnormalities in the pathogenesis of NIDDM has been the subject of numerous studies over the past several decades. Studies of offspring and siblings of NIDDM patients, mono- and dizygotic twins, and ethnic populations with high incidence of NIDDM (e.g. Pima Indians) strongly support the inheritable nature of the disease.</p><p>Despite the presence of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels remain normal in pre-diabetic patients due to a state of compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Eventually, however, insulin secretion is inadequate and fasting hyperglycemia ensues. With time insulin levels decline. Progression of the disease is characterized by increasing FBG levels and declining insulin levels.</p><p>Numerous clinical studies have attempted to define the primary defect that accounts for the progressive increase in FBG. Results from these studies indicate that excessive hepatic glucose output (HGO) is the primary reason for the elevation in FBG with a significant correlation found for HGO and FBG once FBG exceeds 140 mg/dL. Kolterman, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 68:957, (1981); DeFronzo Diabetes 37:667 (1988).</p><p>HGO comprises glucose derived from breakdown of hepatic glycogen (glycogenolysis) and glucose synthesized from 3-carbon precursors (gluconeogenesis). A number of radioisotope studies and several studies using .sup.13 C-NMR spectroscopy have shown that gluconeogenesis contributes between 50-100% of the glucose produced by the liver in the postabsorptive state and that gluconeogenesis flux is excessive (2- to 3-fold) in NIDDM patients. Magnusson, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 90:1323-1327 (1992); Rothman, et al., Science 254: 573-76 (1991); Consoli, et a I. Diabetes 38:550-557 (1989).</p><p>Gluconeogenesis from pyruvate is a highly regulated biosynthetic pathway requiring eleven enzymes (FIG. 1). Seven enzymes catalyze reversible reactions and are common to both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Four enzymes catalyze reactions unique to gluconeogenesis, namely pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase. Overall flux through the pathway is controlled by the specific activities of these enzymes, the enzymes that catalyzed the corresponding steps in the glycolytic direction, and by substrate availability. Dietary factors (glucose, fat) and hormones (insulin, glucagon, glucocorticoids, epinephrine) coordinatively regulate enzyme activities in the gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways through gene expression and post-translational mechanisms.</p><p>Of the four enzymes specific to gluconeogenesis, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (hereinafter "FBPase") is the most suitable target for a gluconeogenesis inhibitor based on efficacy and safety considerations. Studies indicate that nature uses the FBPase/PFK cycle as a major control point (metabolic switch) responsible for determining whether metabolic flux proceeds in the direction of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.

Biochem, 57:755-783 (1988). FBPase is inhibited by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in the cell. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate binds to the substrate site of the enzyme. AMP binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme.</p><p>Synthetic inhibitors of FBPase have also been reported. McNiel reported that fructose-2,6-bisphosphate analogs inhibit FBPase by binding to the substrate site. J. Med. Chem., 106:7851 (1984); U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,790 (1984). These compounds, however, were relatively weak and did not inhibit glucose production in hepatocytes presumably due to poor cell penetration.</p><p>Gruber reported that some nucleosides can lower blood glucose in the whole animal through inhibition of FBPase.

Such prodrugs of the compounds of formula 1, fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p>The term "prodrug ester" as employed herein includes, but is not limited to, the following groups and combinations of these groups:</p><p>[1] Acyloxyalkyl esters which are well described in the literature (Farquhar et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 72, 324-325 (1983)) and are represented by formula A ##STR3## wherein R, R', and R" are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and alicyclic; (see WO 90/08155; WO 90/10636).</p><p>[2] Other acyloxyalkyl esters are possible in which an alicyclic ring is formed such as shown in formula B. These esters have been shown to generate phosphorus-containing nucleotides inside cells through a postulated sequence of reactions beginning with deesterification and followed by a series of elimination reactions (e.g. Freed et al., Biochem. Pharm. 38: 3193-3198 (1989)). ##STR4## wherein R is --H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylamino, arylamino, cycloalkyl, or alicyclic.</p><p>[3] Another class of these double esters known as alkyloxycarbonyloxymethyl esters, as shown in formula A, where R is alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylamino, and arylamino; R', and R" are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and alicyclic, have been studied in the area of β-lactam antibiotics (Tatsuo Nishimura et al. J. Antibiotics, 1987, 40(1), 81-90; for a review see Ferres, H., Drugs of Today, 1983,19, 499. ). More recently Cathy, M. S., et al. (Abstract from AAPS Western Regional Meeting, April, 1997) showed that these alkyloxycarbonyloxymethyl ester prodrugs on (9-[(R)-2-phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA) are bioavailable up to 30% in dogs.</p><p>[4] Aryl esters have also been used as phosphonate prodrugs (e.g. Erion, DeLambert et al., J. Med. Chem. 37:498, 1994; Serafinowska et al., J. Med. Chem. 38:1372, 1995). Phenyl as well as mono and poly-substituted phenyl proesters have generated the parent phosphonic acid in studies conducted in animals and in man (Formula C). Another approach has been described where Y is a carboxylic ester ortho to the phosphate. Khamnei and Torrence, J. Med. Chem.; 39:4109-4115 (1996). ##STR5## wherein Y is H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, acetoxy, halogen, amino, alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, cyano, alkylamino, and alicyclic.</p><p>[5] Benzyl esters have also been reported to generate the parent phosphonic acid. In some cases, using substituents at the para-position can accelerate the hydrolysis. Benzyl analogs with 4-acyloxy or 4-alkyloxy group [Formula D, X═H, OR or O(CO)R or O(CO)OR] can generate the 4-hydroxy compound more readly through the action of enzymes, e.g. oxidases, esterases, etc. Examples of this class of prodrugs are described in Mitchell et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. l 2345 (1992); Brook, et al. WO 91/19721. ##STR6## wherein X and Y are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, acetoxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, perhaloalkyl, halo, or alkyloxycarbonyl; and</p><p>R' and R" are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, halogen, and alicyclic.</p><p>[6] Thio-containing phosphonate proesters have been described that are useful in the delivery of FBPase inhibitors to hepatocytes. These proesters contain a protected thioethyl moiety as shown in formula E. One or more of the oxygens of the phosphonate can be esterified. Since the mechanism that results in de-esterification requires the generation of a free thiolate, a variety of thiol protecting groups are possible. For example, the disulfide is reduced by a reductase-mediated process (Puech et al., Antiviral Res., 22: 155-174 (1993)). Thioesters will also generate free thiolates after esterase-mediated hydrolysis. Benzaria, et al., J. Med. Chem., 39:4958 (1996). Cyclic analogs are also possible and were shown to liberate phosphonate in isolated rat hepatocytes. The cyclic disulfide shown below has not been previously described and is novel. ##STR7## wherein Z is alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, or alkylthio.</p><p>Other examples of suitable prodrugs include proester classes exemplified by Biller and Magnin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,157,027); Serafinowska et al. (J. Med. Chem. 38,1372 (1995)); Starrett et al. (J. Med. Chem. 37, 1857 (1994)); Martin et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 76, 180 (1987); Alexander et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun, 59, 1853 (1994)); and EPO patent application 0 632 048 A1. Some of the structural classes described are optionally substituted, including fused lactones attached at the omega position and optionally substituted 2-oxo-1,3-dioxolenes attached through a methylene to the phosphorus oxygen such as: ##STR8## wherein R is --H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, or alicyclic; and wherein Y is --H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, cyano, alkoxy, acetoxy, halogen, amino, alkylamino, alicyclic, and alkoxycarbonyl.</p><p>[7] Propyl phosphonate proesters can also be used to deliver FBPase inhibitors into hepatocytes. These proesters may contain a hydroxyl and hydroxyl group derivatives at the 3-position of the propyl group as shown in formula F. The R and X groups can form a cyclic ring system as shown in formula F. One or more of the oxygens of the phosphonate can be esterified. ##STR9## wherein R is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl;</p><p>X is hydrogen, alkylcarbonyloxy, alkyloxycarbonyloxy; and</p><p>Y is alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkoxy, alkylamino, alkylthio, halogen, hydrogen, hydroxy, acetoxy, amino.</p><p>[8] The cyclic propyl phosphonate esters as in Formula G are shown to activate to phosphonic acids. The activation of prodrug can be mechanistically explained by in vivo oxidation and elimination steps. These prodrugs inhibit glucose production in isolated rat hepatocytes and are also shown to deliver FBPase inhibitors to the liver following oral administration. ##STR10## wherein V and W are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, 1-alkenyl, 1-alkynyl, and -R.sup.9 ; or</p><p>together V and Z are connected to form a cyclic group containing 3-5 atoms, optionally 1 heteroatom, substituted with hydroxy, acyloxy, alkoxycarboxy, or aryloxycarboxy attached to a carbon atom that is three atoms from an oxygen attached to the phosphorus; or</p><p>together V and W are connected to form a cyclic group containing 3 carbon atoms substituted with hydroxy, acyloxy, alkoxycarboxy, alkylthiocarboxy, hydroxymethyl, and aryloxycarboxy attached to a carbon atom that is three atoms from an oxygen attached to the phosphorus;</p><p>Z is selected from the group consisting of --CH.sub.2 OH, --CH.sub.2 OCOR.sup.3, --CH.sub.2 OC(O)SR.sup.3, --CH.sub.2 OCO.sub.2 R.sup.3, --SR.sup.3, --S(O)R.sup.3, --CH.sub.2 N.sub.3, --CH.sub.2 NR.sup.2.sub.2, --CH.sub.2 Ar, --CH(Ar)OH, --CH(CH═CR.sup.2 R.sup.2)OH, --CH(C.tbd.CR.sup.2)OH, and --R.sup.2 ;</p><p>with the provisos that:</p><p>a) V, Z, W are not all --H; and</p><p>b) when Z is --R.sup.2, then at least one of V and W is not --H or --R.sup.9 ;</p><p>R.sup.2 is selected from the group consisting of R.sup.3 and --H;</p><p>R.sup.3 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, alicyclic, and aralkyl; and</p><p>R.sup.9 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aralkyl, and alicyclic.</p><p>[9] Phosphoramidate derivatives have been explored as potential phosphonate prodrugs (e.g. McGuigan et al., Antiviral Res. 1990, 14: 345; 1991, 15: 255. Serafinowska et al., J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 1372). Most phosphoramidates are unstable under aqueous acidic conditions and are hydrolyzed to the corresponding phosphonic acids. Cyclic phosphoramidates have also been studied as phosphonate prodrugs because of their potential for greater stability compared to non cyclic phosphoramidates (e.g. Starrett et al., J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37:1857).</p><p>Other prodrugs are possible based on literature reports such as substituted ethyls for example, bis(trichloroethyl)esters as disclosed by McGuigan, et al. Bioorg Med. Chem. Lett., 3:1207-1210 (1993), and the phenyl and benzyl combined nucleotide esters reported by Meier, C. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 7:99-104 (1997).</p><p>X group nomenclature as used herein in formula 1 describes the group attached to the phosphonate and ends with the group attached to the 2-position of the benzimidazole ring.

invention typically includes some or all of the following general steps: (1) synthesis of the prodrug; (2) phosphonate deprotection; (3) substitution of the heterocycle; (4) substitution or modification of 2-substituent; (5) cyclization to generate benzimidazole ring system; (6) synthesis of the linker-PO.sub.3 R.sub.2 ; and (7) synthesis of the substituted 1,2-phenylenediamine. A detailed discussion of each step is given below. ##STR60## 1) Preparation of Phosphonate Prodrugs</p><p>Prodrug esters can be introduced at different stages of the synthesis. Most often, these prodrugs are made from the phosphonic acids of formula 6 because of their lability. Advantageously, these prodrug esters can be introduced at an earlier stage, provided they can withstand the reaction conditionms of the subsequent steps.</p><p>Compounds of formula 6, can be alkylated with electrophiles (such as alkyl halides, alkyl sulfonates, etc) under nucleophilic substitution reaction conditions to give phosphonate esters. For example, prodrugs of formula 1, where R.sup.1 is acyloxymethyl group can be synthesized through direct alkylation of the free phosphonic acid of formula 6 with the desired acyloxymethyl halide (e.g. Me.sub.3 CC(O)OCH.sub.2 I; Elhaddadi, et al Phosphorus Sulfur, 1990, 54(1-4): 143; Hoffmann, Synthesis, 1988, 62) in presence of base e.g. N. N'-dicyclohexyl-4-morpholinecarboxamidine, Hunigs base, etc. in polar aprotic solvents such as DMF (Starrett, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1994, 1857). These carboxylates include but are not limited to acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, pivalate, benzoate, and other carboxylates. Alternately, these acyloxymethylphosphonate esters can also be synthesized by treatment of the nitrophosphonic acid (A is NO.sub.2 in formula 6; Dickson, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39: 661; lyer, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1989, 30: 7141; Srivastva, et al, Bioorg. Chem., 1984, 12: 118). This methodology can be extended to many other types of prodrugs, such as compounds of formula 1 where R1 is 3-phthalidyl, 2-oxo-4,5-didehydro-1,3-dioxolanemethyl, and 2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5-yl groups, etc. (Biller and Magnin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,157,027); Serafinowska et al. (J. Med. Chem. 38: 1372 (1995)); Starrett et al. (J. Med. Chem. 37: 1857 (1994)); Martin et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 76:180 (1987); Alexander et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun, 59:1853 (1994)); and EPO 0632048A1). N,N-Dimethylformamide dialkyl acetals can also be used to alkylate phosphonic acids (Alexander, P., et al Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994, 59,1853).</p><p>Alternatively, these phosphonate prodrugs or phosphoramidates can also be synthesized, by reaction of the corresponding dichlorophosphonate and an alcohol or an amine (Alexander, et al, Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994, 59: 1853). For example, the reaction of dichlorophosphonate with phenols and benzyl alcohols in the presence of base (such as pyridine, triethylamine, etc) yields compounds of formula 1 where R.sup.1 is aryl (Khamnei, S., et al J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39: 4109; Serafinowska, H. T., et al J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38:1372; De Lombaert, S., et al J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37:498) or benzyl (Mitchell, A. G., et al J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 1992, 38:2345). The disulfide-containing prodrugs, reported by Puech et al., Antiviral Res., 1993, 22: 155, can also be prepared from dichlorophosphonate and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide under standard conditions.</p><p>Such reactive dichlorophosphonate intermediates, can be prepared from the corresponding phosphonic acids and chlorinating agents e.g. thionyl chloride i(Starrett, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1994, 1857), oxalyl chloride (Stowell, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1990, 31:3261), and phosphorus pentachloride (Quast, et al, Synthesis, 1974, 490). Alternatively, these dichlorophosphonates can also be generated from disilylphosphonate esters (Bhongle, et al, Synth. Commun., 1987, 17: 1071) and dialkylphosphonate esters (Still, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1983, 24: 4405; Patois, et al, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1993, 130: 485).</p><p>Furthermore, these prodrugs can be prepared from Mitsunobu reactions (Mitsunobu, Synthesis, 1981, 1; Campbell, J.Org. Chem., 1992, 52: 6331), and other acid coupling reagents including, but not limited to, carbodiimides (Alexander, et al, Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994, 59: 1853; Casara, et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1992, 2: 145; Ohashi, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1988, 29: 1189), and benzotriazolyloxytris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium salts (Campagne, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1993, 34: 6743). The prodrugs of formula 1 where R.sup.1 is the cyclic carbonate or lactone or phthalidyl can also be synthesized by direct alkylation of free phosphonic acid with the desired halides in the presence of base such as NaH or diisopropylethylamine (Biller and Magnin U.S. Pat. No. 5,157,027; Serafinowska et al. J. Med. Chem. 38: 1372 (1995); Starrett et al. J. Med. Chem. 37: 1857 (1994); Martin et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 76:180 (1987); Alexander et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun, 59: 1853 (1994); and EPO 0632048A1).</p><p>R.sup.1 can also be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis. For example, compounds of formula 1 where R.sup.1 is phenyl can be prepared by phosphorylation of 2-furanyl benzimidazole subjected to a strong base (e.g. LDA) and chlorodiphenyl phosphonate. Alternatively, such compounds can be prepared by alkylation of lithiated furfuraldehyde followed by ring closure to the benzimidazole. ##STR61##</p><p>It is envisioned that compounds of formula 1 can be mixed phosphonate esters (e.g. phenyl benzyl phosphonate esters, phenyl acyloxyalkyl phosphonate esters, etc). For example, the chemically combined phenyl-benzyl prodrugs are reported by Meier, et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1997, 7: 99.</p><p>The substituted cyclic propyl phosphonate esters of formula 1, can be synthesized by reaction of the corresponding dichlorophosphonate and the substituted 1,3-propane diol. The following are some methods to prepare the substituted 1,3-propane diols.</p><p>Synthesis of the 1,3-Propane Diols Used in the Preparation of Certain Prodrugs</p><p>The discussion of this step includes various synthetic methods for the preparation of the following types of propane-1,3-diols: i) 1-substituted; ii) 2-substituted; and iii) 1,2- or 1,3-annulated. Different groups on the prodrug part of the molecule ie., on the propane diol moiety can be introduced or modified either during the synthesis of the diols or after the synthesis of the prodrugs.</p><p>i) 1-Substituted 1,3-Propane Diols</p><p>Propane-1,3-diols can be synthesized by several well known methods in the literature. Aryl Grignard additions to 1-hydroxypropan-3-al gives 1-aryl-substituted propane-1,3-diols (path a). This method will enable conversion of various substituted aryl halides to 1-arylsubstituted-1,3-propane diols (Coppi, et. al., J. Org. Chem., 1988, 53, 911). Aryl halides can also be used to synthesize 1-substituted propanediols by Heck coupling of 1,3-diox-4-ene followed by reduction and hydrolysis (Sakamoto, et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1992, 33, 6845). A variety of aromatic aldehydes can be converted to 1-substituted-1,3-propane diols by vinyl Grignard addition followed by hydroboration (path b). Substituted aromatic aldehydes are also useful for lithium-t-butylacetate addition followed by ester reduction (path e) (Turner., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55 4744). In another method, commercially available cinnamyl alcohols can be converted to epoxy alcohols under catalytic asymmetric epoxidation conditions. These epoxy alcohols are reduced by Red-Al to result in enantiomerically pure propane-1,3-diols (path c). Alternatively, enantiomerically pure 1,3-diols can be obtained by chiral borane reduction of hydroxyethyl aryl ketone derivatives (Ramachandran, et. al., Tetrahedron Left., 1997, 38 761). Pyridyl, quinoline, and isoquinoline propan-3-ol derivatives can be oxygenated to 1-substituted propan-1,3-diols by N-oxide formation followed by rearrangement under acetic anhydride conditions (path d) (Yamamoto, et. al., Tetrahedron, 1981, 37,1871). ##STR62## ii) 2-Substituted 1,3-Propane Diols</p><p>Various 2-substituted propane-1,3-diols can be made from commercially available 2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propane diol. Triethyl methanetricarboxylate can be converted to the triol by complete reduction (path a) or diolmonocarboxylic acid derivatives can be obtained by partial hydrolysis and diester reduction (Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, New York, 1989). Nitrotriol is also known to give the triol by reductive elimination (path b) (Latour, et. al., Synthesis, 1987, 8, 742). The triol can be derivatized as a mono acetate or carbonate by treatment with alkanoyl chloride, or alkylchloroformate, respectively (path d) (Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley, New York, 1990). Aryl substitution effected by oxidation to the aldehyde followed by aryl Grignard additions (path c) and the aldehyde can also be converted to substituted amines by reductive amination reactions (path e). ##STR63## iii) Annulated 1,3-Propane Diols</p><p>Prodrugs of formula 1 where V--Z or V--W are fused by three carbons are made from cyclohexane diol derivatives. Commercially available cis, cis-1,3,5-cyclohexane triol can be used for prodrug formation. This cyclohexanetriol can also be modified as described in the case of 2-substituted propan-1,3-diols to give various analogues. These modifications can either be made before or after formation of prodrugs. Various 1,3-cyclohexane diols can be made by Diels-Alder methodology using pyrone as the diene (Posner, et. al., Tetrahedron Left., 1991, 32, 5295). Cyclohexyl diol derivatives are also made by nitrile oxide olefin-additions (Curran, et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1985, 107, 6023). Alternatively, cyclohexyl precursors can be made from quinic acid (Rao, et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1991, 32, 547.)</p><p>2) Phosphonate Deprotection</p><p>Compounds of formula 6, may be prepared from phosphonate esters of formula 5, using known phosphate and phosphonate ester cleavage conditions. In general, silyl halides have been used to cleave the various phosphonate esters, followed by mild hydrolysis of the resulting silyl phosphonate esters to give the desired phosphonic acids. Depending on the stability of the products, these reactions are usually accomplished in the presence of acid scavengers such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane, 2,6-lutidine, etc. Such silyl halides include, chlorotrimethylsilane (Rabinowitz, J. Org. Chem., 1963, 28: 2975), bromotrimethylsilane (McKenna, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1977, 155), iodotrimethylsilane (Blackburn, et al, J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1978, 870). Alternately, phosphonate esters can be cleaved under strong acid conditions, (e.g HBr, HCl, etc.) in polar solvents, preferably acetic acid (Moffatt, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,524,846,1970) or water. These esters can also be cleaved via dichlorophosphonates, prepared by treating the esters with with halogenating agents e.g. phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride, BBr.sub.3, etc.(Pelchowicz, et al, J. Chem. Soc., 1961, 238) followed by aqueous hydrolysis to give phosphonic acids. Aryl and benzyl phosphonate esters can be cleaved under hydrogenolysis conditions (Lejczak, et al, Synthesis, 1982, 412; Elliott, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1985, 28: 1208; Baddiley, et al, Nature, 1953, 171: 76 ) or dissolving metal reduction conditions(Shafer, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1977, 99: 5118). Electrochemical (Shono, et al, J. Org. Chem., 1979, 44: 4508) and pyrolysis (Gupta, et al, Synth. Commun., 1980, 10: 299) conditions have also been used to cleave various phosphonate esters.</p><p>3) Substitution of the Heterocycle</p><p>The benzimidazole ring system of formula 4, may require further elaboration to provide desired compounds of formula 5.</p><p>i) Substitution of the Phenyl Ring</p><p>Electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions enable incorporation of the desired substitutions encompassed by the formula 5. (March, Advanced Organic Chemistry by, Wiley-Interscience, 1992, 501-521; 641-654). For example, treatment of the compounds of formula 4, where A is NH.sub.2, L and J are hydrogens with NBS, NCS or NIS in halogenated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or chloroform gives halo-substituted compounds of formula 5 (L and/or J are halogens). Compounds of formula 5, where A is NO.sub.2, L and/or J are alkenyl, alkynyl, alkyl, or aryl groups, and Y is H or alkyl, may be prepared from compounds of formula 4, where A is NO.sub.2, R is H or alkyl, and L and/or J are halogens, preferably bromide or iodide, through Stille coupling (Stille, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986, 25: 508-524). Treatment of the compounds of formula 4, where A is NO.sub.2, and L and/or J are bromides, with a coupling reagent (e.g. tributyl(vinyl)tin, phenylboronic acid, propargyl alcohol, N,N-propargyl amine etc.) in presence of palladium catalyst [e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (Il)chloride, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0), etc.] in solvent, such as DMF, toluene, etc. provides the coupling products. The compounds thus obtained can be modified as needed. For example vinyl or propargyl alcohol derivatives can be hydrogenated to give the ethyl or propyl alcohol derivatives respectively. These alcohols can be further modified as required via alkyl halides (ref. Wagner et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 30, 557.) or alkyl sulfonates etc. to a number of substituted alkyls such as amino alkyl compounds by subjecting them to nucleophilic substitution reactions (March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, Fourth Edition, 1992, 293-500). Alternatively, these substitutions can also be done by metal exchange followed by quenching with an appropriate nucleophile (Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, 1992, 606-609). Nucleophilic addition reactions can also be useful in preparing compounds of formula 5. For example, when A is NO.sub.2, L and/or J are halogens, nucleophiles such as alkoxides, thiols, amines, etc. provide the halogen displacement products. (March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, Fourth Edition, 1992, 649-676). Another example is addition reactions, for example cyclopropanation (Vorbruggen et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 1975, 629), on the olefins(e g. styryl type) synthesized through Stille coupling.</p><p>If required, these substituted compounds can be further modified to the desired products. For example, reduction of the NO.sub.2 to NH.sub.2 may be done in many different ways, e.g. Pd/C, H.sub.2, aq. Na.sub.2 S.sub.2 O.sub.4, etc. (Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, 412-415). These primary aromatic amines can also be modified as needed. For example, N-acetyl derivatives can be prepared by treatment with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride in the presence of a base such as pyridine. The mono- or di-alkylamines can be synthesized by direct alkylation, using a base such as NaH in polar solvents such as DMF or by reductive alkylation methods (ref. Abdel-Magid et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31, 5595; also see ref. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, Fourth Edition, 1992, 898-900 for more methods).</p><p>ii) Alkylation of the Imidazole Ring</p><p>Alkylation of the heterocycle of formula 4, (where R and J are both H) is obtained through two distinct methods that are amenable to a large number of electrophiles: a) Mitsunobu alkylation, and b) base alkylation.</p><p>a) Mitsunobu Alkylation</p><p>Alkylation of the benzimidazole ring system of formula 4, is achieved by treatment of an alcohol, triphenylphosphine and dialkylazodicarboxylate with heterocycle and a non-nucleophilic base such as Hunigs base in polar solvents such as CH.sub.3 CN (Zwierzak et al, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1986, 402).</p><p>b) Base Alkylation</p><p>Alternately, the benzimidazole ring system of formula 4 can be deprotonated with a suitable base, preferably cesium carbonate in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMF, and the resulting anion is alkylated with an appropriate electrophilic component Y--L', where L' is a leaving group preferably bromide or iodide.</p><p>4) Substitution or Modification of a 2-substituent</p><p>Another key intermediate envisioned in the synthesis of compounds of formula 4 are substituted 2-methylbenzimidazoles. These compounds are readily prepared by condensing Ac.sub.2 O with the appropriate 1,2-phenylenediamine (Phillips, J. Chem. Soc., 1928, 29: 1305). These compounds are useful in the synthesis of formula 1, wherein X is CH.sub.2 ZCH.sub.2 (Z═O,S,NH). For example, compounds where Z═O are readily prepared by treatment of the 2-methylbenzimidazole with a halogenating agent such as NBS followed by reaction with the α-hydroxy phosphonate ester (also see section 6, Synthesis of the Linker-PO.sub.3 R.sub.2). Alternately, a heterosubstituted methyl phosphonates can also be prepared by displacement reactions on phosphonomethyl halides or sulfonates (Phillion et al, Tetrahedron Leff., 1986, 27: 1477.) with an appropriate nucleophile e.g. 2-hydroxylmethylbenzimidazole compound which can be prepared using a variety of methods, including oxidation of the substituted 2-methylbenzimidazoles.</p><p>Similarly, compounds of formula 1, where X is carboxypropyl or sulfonopropyl can be prepared from the reaction of 2-(2-iodoethyl) benzimidazole and corresponding phosphonomethylcarboxylate or phosphonomethylsulfonate (Carretero et al., Tetrahedron, 1987, 43, 5125) in the presence of base such as NaH in polar aprotic solvents such as DMF. The substituted 2-(2-iodoethyl) benzimidazole can be prepared from condensation of the corresponding substituted diamine and 3-halopropanaldehyde. Also see ref. Magnin, D. R. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 657 for the preparation of α-phosphosulfonic acids.</p><p>The componds of formula 4 where X is all carbon e.g. --(CH.sub.2).sub.3 -- can be prepared by Stille coupling (Stille Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986, 25: 508-524) of the dialkylphosphopropenyl tributylstanne (J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58: 6531.) and appropriate 2-bromobenzimidazole (Mistry, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1986, 27: 1051).</p><p>The componds of formula 4 where X is an amide linker e.g. --CONHCH.sub.2 -- can be synthesized using the following two steps. Treatment of the appropriate 1,2-phenylenediamine with trihalomethylacetamidate preferably trichloromethylacetamidate in polar solvent such as acetic acid followed by hydrolysis of the trihalomethyl group with strong aqueous base (e.g. KOH) gives the benzimidazole-2-carboxylic acid (Eur. J. Med. Chem., 1993, 28: 71). Condensation of the acid with an amino phosphonate e.g. diethyl(aminomethyl)phosphonate in presence of a coupling agent (e.g. pyBOP) in a polar solvent such as methylene chloride provides the amide linked phosphonate.</p><p>The componds of formula 4 where X is an amide linker e.g. --NHCOCH.sub.2 -- can be synthesized using the following two steps. Treatment of the appropriate 1,2-phenylenediamine with cyanogenbromide (Johnson, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36: 3361) in polar solvent such as MeOH gives the 2-amino benzimidazole. Condensation of the 2-aminobenzimidazole with a carboxylic acid e.g. diethyl(carboxymethyl)phosphonate using standard coupling conditions (Klausner, et al, Synthesis, 1972, 453) provides the amide linked phosphonate. The 2-aminobenzimidazoles can also be prepared from the 2-bromobenzimidazole via the 2-azidobenzimidazole using known methods (Chem. Rev. 1988, 88: 297).</p><p>5) Cyclization to Generate Benzimidazole Ring System</p><p>The benzimidazole ring systems of formula 4 is preferably assembled by condensation of substituted 1,2-phenylenediamines with an aldehyde (RCHO, where R is e.g. aliphatic, heteroaliphatic, aromatic or heteroaromatic etc.) using known methods; (a) in presence of Fe.sup.3+  salts, preferably FeCl.sub.3, in polar solvents such as DMF, EtOH etc., (b) reflux in non-polar solvents such as toluene followed by oxidation, preferably with iodine (Bistocchi et al, Collect. Czech. Chem. C, 1985, 50(9): 1959.)., (c) in cases of protected aldehydes, the first condensation can be achieved in the presence of a dilute inorganic acid, preferably 10% H.sub.2 SO.sub.4, in polar solvents such as THF, followed by oxidation with l.sub.2. Alternatively, this coupling can be achieved with an anhydride (RCOOCOR), a carboxylic acid (RCOOH), with a nitrile (RCN) by methods reported by Hein, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957, 79, 427.; and Applegate, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,310,923; or imidates (R--C(═NH)--OEt) ref. Maryanoff, et al. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38: 16. ##STR64##</p><p>Advantageously, these benzimidazole ring systusingan be constructed using solid phase synthesis (ref: Phillips et al. Tet. Lett., 1996, 37: 4887; Lee et al., Tet. Lett, 1998: 35: 201.</p><p>6) Synthesis of the Linker-PO.sub.3 R.sub.2</p><p>Coupling of aromatic or aliphatic aldehydes, ketals or acetals of aldehydes, and acid derivatives with attached phophonate esters are particularly well suited for the synthesis of compounds of formula 1.</p><p>i) Preparation of Aryl and Heteroaryl Phosphonate Esters</p><p>Aryl functionalized phosphonate linkers can be prepared by lithiation of an aromatic ring using methods well described in literature (Gschwend, Org. React. 1979, 26, 1; Durst, Comprehensive Carbanion Chemistry, Vol. 5, Elsevier, N.Y., 1984) followed by addition of phosphorylating agents (e.g. CIPO.sub.3 R.sub.2). Phosphonate esters are also introduced by Arbuzov-Michaelis reaction of primary halides (Brill, T. B., Chem Rev., 1984, 84: 577). Aryl halides undergo Ni.sup.2+  catalysed reaction with trialkylphosphites to give aryl phosphonate containing compounds (Balthazar, et al, J. Org. Chem., 1980, 45: 5425). Aromatic triflates are known to result in phosphonates with CIPO.sub.3 R.sub.2 in the presence of a palladium catalyst (Petrakis, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1987, 109: 2831; Lu, et al, Synthesis, 1987, 726). In another method, aryl phosphonate esters are prepared from aryl phosphates under anionic rearrangement conditions (Melvin, Tetrahedron Leff., 1981, 22: 3375; Casteel, et al, Synthesis, 1991, 691). Using the same method described above, arylphosphate esters, where X is aryloxy, can also be made. N-Alkoxy aryl salts with alkali metal derivatives of dialkyl phosphonate provide general synthesis for heteroaryl-2-phosphonate linkers (Redmore, J. Org. Chem., 1970, 35: 4114).</p><p>In the linker phosphonate synthesis, aldehyde, ketone, or carboxylic acid functionalities can also be introduced after the phosphonate ester is formed. A lithiation reaction can be used to incorporate the aldehyde or ketone functionalities, although other methods known to generate aromatic aldehydes or ketones can be envisioned as well (e.g. Vilsmeier-Hack reaction, Reimar-Teimann reaction etc.; Pizey, Synthetic reagents, 1974, 1: 1; Wynberg, H., et al, Org. React. 1982, 28: 1; palladium catalyzed coupling reaction of acid halides and organotin compounds). For example, for the lithiation reaction, the lithiated aromatic ring can be treated with reagents that directly generate the aldehyde (e.g. DMF, HCOOR, etc.)(Einchorn, J., et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1986, 27:1791), or the ketone (e.g. Weinreb's amide, RCOOR'). The lithiated aromatic ring can also be treated with reagents that lead to a group that is subsequently transformed into the aldehyde or ketone group using known chemistry (synthesis of aldehyde and ketone from alcohol, ester, cyano, alkene, etc.). It is also envisioned that the sequence of these reactions can be reversed, i.e. the aldehyde and ketone moieties can be incorporated first, followed by the phosphorylation reaction. The order of the reaction will depend on reaction conditions and protecting groups. Prior to the phosphorylation it is also envisioned that it may be advantageous to protect the aldehyde or ketone using well-known methods (acetal, aminal, hydrazone, ketal, etc.), and then the aldehyde or ketone is unmasked after phosphorylation. (Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W., 1991, Wiley, New York).</p><p>The above mentioned methods can also be extended to the heteroaryl linkers e.g. pyridine, furan, thiophene etc.</p><p>ii) Preparation of Aliphatic and Heteroaliphatic Phosphonate Esters</p><p>Compounds of formula 3, where M is CO.sub.2 R and X is alkyl can be synthesized using reactions well known in the art. Trialkyl phosphites attack lactones at the β-carbon atom, causing the alkyl-oxygen cleavage of the lactone ring, to yield alkyl(dialkylphosphono)esters. This reaction can be applied to many types of lactones such as β-lactones, γ-lactones etc. as reported by McConnell et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1956, 78, 4453. Alternatively, these type of compounds can be synthesized using the Arbuzov reaction (Chem. Rev. 1984, 84: 577). The linkers Ar(Z)alkyl phosphonates (Ar═aryl; Z═O,S etc.) can be prepared from the reaction of substituted aryls e.g. salicylaldehyde with an appropriate phosphonate electrophile [L(CH2).sub.n PO.sub.3 R.sub.2, L is a leaving group, preferably iodine; Walsh et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1956, 78, 4455.] in the presence of a base, preferably K.sub.2 CO.sub.3 or NaH, in a polar aprotic solvent, such as DMF or DMSO. For the preparation of α-phosphosulfonic acids see ref. Magnin, D. R. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 657; and ref. cited therein.</p><p>Compounds of formula 3, where M is CO.sub.2 R or CHO and X is carbonylalkyl can be synthesized from the acid chlorides (for example H(O)C--CH.sub.2 C(O)Cl) and P(OEt).sub.3 (Chem. Rev. 1984, 84: 577). These α-ketophosphonates can be converted to the α-hydroxyphoshonates and α,α-dihalophosphonates (ref. Smyth, et al. Tett. Lett., 1992, 33, 4137). For another method of synthesizing these α,α-dihalophosphonates see the ref. Martin et al. Tett. Lett. 1992, 33, 1839.</p><p>Compounds of formula 3, where X is a heteroalkyl linker e.g. --CH.sub.2 ZCH.sub.2 -- where Z═O,S etc. and M is aldehyde or its protected form such as dialkyl acetal (Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W., 1991, Wiley, New York) can be prepared by nucleophilic substitution reactions (March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, Fourth Edition, 1992, 293-500) to give unsymmetrical ethers. For example linkers of formula 3, where X is alkyloxymethyl can be synthesized through direct alkylation of the hydroxymethyl phosphonate ester, with the desired alkyl halide [L(CH.sub.2).sub.n CH(OMe).sub.2, L is a leaving group, preferably bromine or iodine] in the presence of a base, preferably NaH, in a polar aprotic solvent, such as DMF or DMSO. These methods can be extended to the heteroalkyl linkers e.g. --CH.sub.2 ZCH.sub.2 -- where Z═S, NH etc.</p><p>7) Synthesis of the Substituted 1,2-phenylenediamine</p><p>1,2-Phenylenediamines utilized in the preparation of compounds of formula 1, can be synthesized using methods well known in the art.</p><p>(a) Compounds of formula 2, where R is H, can be synthesized from simple aromatic: compounds. Most aromatic compounds may be nitrated given the wide variety of nitrating agents available(March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience, 1992, 522-525). Primary aromatic amines are often N-acetylated before nitration by treatment with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. Nitration of the these acetanilide derivatives using 60% HNO.sub.3 and H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 (Monge et al, J Med. Chem., 1995, 38:1786; Ridd Chem. Soc. Rev. 1991, 20: 149-1651, followed by deprotection by strong acid (e.g. H.sub.2 SO.sub.4, HCl, etc.), and hydrogenation (e.g. H.sub.2, Pd/C; Na.sub.2 S.sub.2 O.sub.4 ; etc.) of the resulting 2-nitroanilines provides the desired substituted 1,2-phenylenediamines. Similarly, substituted arylhalides (F,Cl,Br,I) can also be nitrated to provide α-halonitroaryl compounds followed by nucleophilic addition (e.g. NH.sub.3, NH.sub.2 OH, etc) and reduction to generate the diamines.</p><p>(b) Diamines of formula 2, where A is NO.sub.2 and R is H, can be produced using the method of Grivas et. al., Synthesis 1992, 1283 and Tian et al J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans 1, 1993, 257 and an appropriate o-nitroaniline. A variety of reactions can be used to substitute the o-nitroaniline. For example halogenation of the nitroaniline (e.g. Br.sub.2, Cl.sub.2 etc.) gives the corresponding 4,6-disubstituted or monosubstituted nitroaniline which can be further modified at a later stage. The nitro group can be reduced with number of reagents preferably sodium dithionite to provide the corresponding diamine. This diamine is then subjected to nitration conditions by first generating the 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole with selenium dioxide followed by nitric acid. Substituted nitro-1,2-phenylenediamines are generated by treatment of the nitro-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole with aqueous hydrogen iodide or NH.sub.3 /H.sub.2 S (Nyhammar et al, Acta, Chem. Scand. 1986, B40: 583). Other methods to simultaneously protect the diamine are also envisioned.</p><p>(c) The compounds of formula 2, where R is alkyl or aryl, can be synthesized using the method of Ohmori et al, J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39: 3971. Nucleophilic substitution of the o-halonitrobenzenes by treatment with various alkylamines followed by reduction (e.g. Na.sub.2 S.sub.2 O.sub.4) of the nitro group provides the desired compounds. Alternately, the compounds of formula 2, where R is H, can be synthesized from these o-halonitrobenzenes via o-azidonitrobenzenes followed by reduction of the nitro group to provide the desired compound.</p><p>(d) Alternately, diamines of formula 2 where R is not H are prepared by reductive alkylation of the o-nitroanilines with various aldehydes(e.g. akyl, aryl etc.) in the presence of a reducing agent preferably NaB(OAc).sub.3 followed by reduction (e.g. Na.sub.2 S.sub.2 O.sub.4 ; Pd/C, H.sub.2 etc.) of the nitro group (Magid et al Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31: 5595).</p><p>Formulations</p><p>Compounds of the invention are administered orally in a total daily dose of about 0.1 mg/kg/dose to about 100 mg/kg/dose, preferably from about 0.3 mg/kg/dose to about 30 mg/kg/dose. The most preferred dose range is from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg (approximately 1 to 20 nmoles/kg/dose). The use of time-release preparations to control the rate of release of the active ingredient may be preferred. The dose may be administered in as many divided doses as is convenient. When other methods are used (e.g. intravenous administration), compounds are administered to the affected tissue at a rate from 0.3 to 300 nmol/kg/min, preferably from 3 to 100 nmoles/kg/min. Such rates are easily maintained when these compounds are intravenously administered as discussed below.</p><p>For the purposes of this invention, the compounds may be administered by a variety of means including orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, or rectally in formulations containing pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used here includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intraarterial injections with a variety of infusion techniques. Intraarterial and intravenous injection as used herein includes administration through catheters. Oral administration is generally preferred.</p><p>Pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in any form suitable for the intended method of administration. When used for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.</p><p>Formulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.</p><p>Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.</p><p>Oil suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oral suspensions may contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.</p><p>Dispersible powders and granules of the invention suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, a mineral oil, such as liquid paraffin, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, such as soybean lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsion may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.</p><p>Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, such as glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, a flavoring or a coloring agent.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.</p><p>The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain 20 to 2000 μmol (approximately 10 to 1000 mg) of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions. It is preferred that the pharmaceutical composition be prepared which provides easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion should contain from about 0.05 to about 50 μmol (approximately 0.025 to 25 mg) of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur.</p><p>As noted above, formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.</p><p>A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder (e.g., povidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach. This is particularly advantageous with the compounds of formula 1 when such compounds are susceptible to acid hydrolysis.</p><p>Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.</p><p>Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.</p><p>Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.</p><p>Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.</p><p>Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of a fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase inhibitor compound.</p><p>It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the individual being treated; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; other drugs which have previously been administered; and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy, as is well understood by those skilled in the art.</p><p>Utility</p><p>FBPase inhibitors at the AMP site may be used to treat diabetes mellitus, lower blood glucose levels, and inhibit gluconeogenesis.</p><p>FBPase inhibitors at the AMP site may also be used to treat excess glycogen storage diseases. Excessive hepatic glycogen stores are found in patients with some glycogen storage diseases. Since the indirect pathway contributes significantly to glycogen synthesis (Shulman, G. I. Phys. Rev. 72:1019-1035 (1992)), inhibition of the indirect pathway (gluconeogenesis flux) is expected to decrease glycogen overproduction.</p><p>FBPase inhibitors at the AMP site may also be used to treat or prevent diseases associated with increased insulin levels. Increased insulin levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and atherosclerosis (Folsom, et al., Stroke, 25:66-73 (1994); Howard, G. et al., Circulation 93:1809-1817 (1996)). FBPase inhibitors are expected to decrease postprandial glucose levels by enhancing hepatic glucose uptake. This effect is postulated to occur in individuals that are non-diabetic (or pre-diabetic, i.e. without elevated HGO or fasting blood glucose levels). Increased hepatic glucose uptake will decrease insulin secretion and thereby decrease the risk of diseases or complications that arise from elevated insulin levels.</p><p>The compounds of this invention and their preparation can be understood further by the examples which illustrate some of the processes by which these compounds are prepared. These examples should not however be construed as specifically limiting the invention and variations of the invention, now known or later developed, are considered to fall within the scope of the present invention as hereinafter claimed.</p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><heading>Example 1</heading><heading>Preparation of 2-Furaldehyde-5-diethylphosphonate</heading><p>Method A</p><p>To a solution of 25 mL (147.5 mmol) 2-furaldehyde diethyl acetal in 25 ml of THF at -78 hexane solution.

After 50 minutes a bolus of .sup.14 C-sodium bicarbonate (40 μCi/100 g body weight) was administered via the same route. 20 minutes later, the animals were quickly anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbitol and a blood sample (1.5 mL) was taken by cardiac puncture. Blood (0.5 mL) was diluted into 6 mL deionized water and protein precipitated by addition of 1 mL zinc sulfate (0.3 N) and 1 mL barium hydroxide (0.3 N). The mixture was centrifuged (20 minutes, 1000 and 5 mL of the resulting supernatant was then combined with 1 g of a mixed bed ion exchange resin (1 part AG 50W-X8, 100-200 mesh, hydrogen form and 2 parts of AG 1-X8, 100-200 mesh, acetate form) to separate .sup.14 C-bicarbonate from .sup.14 C-glucose.

Blood glucose was measured in blood obtained from a tall vein nick by means of a HemoCue Inc. (Mission Viejo, Calif.) glucose analyzer. One group of 12 subsequently received compound 12.64 (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and the other 12 ("controls") an equivalent volume of saline. Food was removed from the animals. Blood glucose was measured in each animal four hours after dosing, and a second dose of drug or saline was then administered. Four hours later, a final blood glucose measurement was made.

The rats were subsequently placed in metabolic cages and urine was collected for 24 hours. The quantity of parent compound excreted into urine was determined by HPLC analysis. An ODS column eluted with a gradient from potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5 to acetonitrile was employed for these measurements. Detection was at 310-325 nm. The percentage oral bioavailability was estimated by comparison of the recovery in urine of the parent compound generated from the prodrug, to that recovered in urine 24 hours after intravenous administration of unsubstituted parent compound at 5 approximately 10 mg/kg. Parent compounds were typically dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and administered via the tail vein in animals that were briefly anesthetized with halothane.</p><p>For Compound A, 6-amino-9-neopentyl, B-(2-(5-diisobutyryloxymethylphosphono)furanyl purine, a prodrug of parent Compound B, 6-amino-9-neopentyl-8-(2-(5-phosphono)furanyl purine, 6.2% of an oral dose of approximately 20 mg/kg was recovered in urine. For the parent compound, 76.8% of an intravenous dose of approximately 10 mg/kg was recovered. The oral bioavailability of this prodrug was therefore calculated to be 6.2/76.8, or approximately 8%.
