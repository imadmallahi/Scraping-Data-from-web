What is meant by a "soybean extract" is a blend of compounds isolated from soybean. The soybean extract may contain only a portion of the soybean (e.g., an extract of the<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> soybean such as a lipid reduced soybean powder or filtered soymilk) or may contain the entire soybean (e.g., a ground powder of the soybean). The soybean extract may be in the form of a fluid (e.g., soymilk) or a solid (e.g., a soybean powder or soymilk powder).</p><p num="p0068">The soybean extract may be soybean powder. Soybean powder may be made by grinding dry soybeans. The soybean powder may be lyophilized. Soymilk and soymilk powder are also useful soybean extracts. Soymilk is a combination of solids derived from soybeans and water, the mixture of which has some or all of the insoluble constituents filtered off. Soymilk powder is evaporated soymilk, which in one embodiment, is in a lyophilized or spray-dried form. Procedures for manufacturing soymilk include, but are not limited to, the following three procedures. First, soymilk may be made by placing soybeans into water to allow them to absorb the water. The swelled beans are then ground and additional water is then added. The mixture may then be filtered to remove any insoluble residue. Second, soymilk may also be prepared from soybean powder. Soybean powder is thoroughly mixed with water (e.g., for at least one hour), which may then be followed by a filtration process to remove insoluble residues. Third, soymilk can also be reconstituted from soymilk powder by adding water. The soymilk may comprise from about 1% to about 50%, by weight (e.g., from about 5% to about 20%, by weight) of solids from the soybean.</p><p num="p0069">The known active ingredients of soybeans include, but not limiting to, isoflavones, phytoestrogens, genistein, daidzein, glycitein, saponins, and<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> phytosterols. The soybean extracts useful in this invention may be produced from all soybean species, regardless of their geographic origin, sun exposure, harvest time and the like. However, specific strains, geographic origins or growth conditions might be preferred. For example, but not limiting to, soybean strains particularly rich in its Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (STI) content or in isoflavone content, or growth conditions that result in STI or isoflavone enrichment in the bean, might be preferred.</p><p num="p0070">In one embodiment, the soybean extract is a non-denatured soybean extract. "Denaturation" is defined in the Bantam Medical Dictionary (1990 edition) as "the change in the physical and the physiological properties of a protein, that are brought about by heat, X-rays or chemicals. These changes include loss of activity (in the case of enzymes) and loss (or alteration) of antigenicity (in the case of antigens)". What is meant by "non-denatured plant extract" is a product extracted or derived from a plant in which the processing for the derivation of such plant extract (e.g., the temperature, extraction media) did not eliminate its protease inhibitory activity. One such protease is trypsin. In one embodiment, the non-denatured state of the soybean extract of this invention is measured by the presence of an intact soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) protein, or by its trypsin inhibitory activity.</p><p num="p0071">It should be noted that the soybean extracts useful in the compositions of this invention may have a distinctive odor. If necessary, the odor of the extracts may be reduced by using soybean products<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> derived from specific strains of soybeans known to produce reduced-odor, including, but not limited to, lipoxygenase-2- deficient beans and those having modified sugar profile, and the like. A process to reduce oxygen levels in the formulation may also reduce the odor. Various masking agents or fragrances may also be used to mask the odor. One way to make soymilk is to soak the soybeans in deionized or purified water for several hours, and grind them after they were fully hydrated, with the addition of small quantities of water. The grinding process allows the soybean milk to be extracted. After collection, the soybean milk may be filtered to remove any residual parts of the bean husk.</p><p num="p0072">The soymilk used in the formulations described below can be fresh soymilk as described above, or may be made from soybean powder and water. The soybean powder is milled from soybeans and may also be lyophilized, spray dried, or freeze-dried and the resulting soymilk may or may not be filtered. Such prepared soymilk may have from about 1 to about 90% by weight dry soybean powder. Another example is the use of soymilk powder, made from lyophilized, spray dried or freeze-dried soymilk, with the addition of water and finished with or without filtration or homogenization. Other methods of soybean extraction could also be used to create the active ingredients in the formulations described below. For example, the active ingredients could be extracted from ground soybeans using ethanol/water mixtures, followed by the removal of the ethanol from the extract, in such ways that the serine protease inhibitory<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> activity of the soybean will be retained, and preferably that the protein STI will remain intact. In one embodiment, the soybean extracts utilized in the present invention have a microbial content of less than about 1,000 cfu per gram (such as less than about 100 cfu per gram) of the soybean extract.</p><p num="p0073">The soybean extract may be exposed to gamma irradiation. The soybean extract may be exposed to from about 2 to about 30 kGy of gamma irradiation, such as from about 5 and about 10 kGy of gamma irradiation. Such treatment reduces the microbial content of the soybean extract, while maintaining its biological activity (e.g., serine protease inhibitory activity). The treatment of soybean extracts with gamma irradiation maintains the cosmetic elegance of the composition, such as maintained natural colors and does not induce significant malodors.</p><p num="p0074">Other anti-microbial processes that also maintain the protease inhibitory activity of the soybean extract that can be practiced alone or in combination with gamma irradiation, include, but are not limited to, exposure to x-rays, high energy electron or proton beams, ultraviolet radiation, hydrostatic pressure, and addition of chemical agents possessing antimicrobial activity, and combinations thereof.</p><heading><u style="single">Other Materials</u></heading><p num="p0075">Various other materials may also be present in the compositions useful in the subject invention.

Human keratinocytes were plated at 5.0 x10<sup>4</sup> cells/electrode well and cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmospheres of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub> for 24-48 hrs. Capacitance<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> changes (in nanofarads, nF) of keratinocytes were measured using a Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing System (ECIS) Model 1600R (Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY) using the method of Wegener and co-workers (Wegener J, Keese CR, Giaever I, Exp Cell Res. 259:158-166, 2000) at a frequency of 40,000Hz. Capacitance readings are inversely related to the contact area of a cell onto the ECIS electrode array, the greater the cell area contacting the electrode the smaller the capacitance readings (Wegener J, Keese CR, Giaever I, Exp Cell Res. 259:158-166, 2000). Conversely as a cell contracts or shrinks, the contact area of the cell onto the ECIS electrode array decreases, resulting in an increase in the capacitance readings. The change in capacitance readings for each treatment groups was integrated over 5 hrs as a function of area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis from approximately 1000 keratinocyte cells. These calculations are based on the trapezoid theorem. The AUC of the media curve was subtracted from the compound treated group. A positive AUC difference indicates keratinocyte contraction, the greater the AUC difference the greater the amount of keratinocyte contraction. The following compounds were used in the example: N,N,N',N'-Tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)ethylenediamine (THPED, available from BASF under the tradename "Quadrol" or "Neutrol") and 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol (available from BASF under the tradename "DMAE"). DMAE is a known skin-firming agent.

As the preferred disposition of the collagen fibers corresponds to the skin's cleavage line (Lange's lines), the speed of propagation of elastic disturbances on the skin will depend strongly on its orientation. Skin sites on the body where the skin is the loosest would present the strongest orientation effects, e.g. on the upper inner arm, the neck, the thighs and the abdomen based on collagen fiber orientation.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --></p><p num="p0088">In this study we chose an instrument that allows the determination of directional tension along the surface of the skin. The velocity of sound depends on the density and tension of the material through which it is propagating, for example sound travels faster in water than it does in air and faster yet in a solid. Mechanical vibrations propagate faster the higher the tension, like a guitar string the higher the tension the higher the frequency of oscillation after plucking. The probe that comes in contact with the skin of the instrument in question is composed of two transducers placed 1.5-2 mm apart and mounted on two independent supports. Then one transducer generates a motion of small amplitude (&lt;1 mm) and the second transducer determines when the disturbance generated by the first transducer arrives at its location. From this time, we can calculate the velocity of propagation and, therefore, the tension along the skin. In the limit where the motion of the transducer is less than 100 microns, the instrument would probably probe the tension in the epidermis and as the motion becomes larger the motion would include the dermis. The instrument used in this study generates a motion that probes the epidermis and the superficial dermis. The time that it takes the acoustic pulse to go from transmitter to receiver is the measured parameter called Resonance Running Time (RRT). The RRT depends on the directional orientation of the collagen bundles. Readings must be performed in different angles: 0°, 45°, 90 ° and 135°. In this study readings as function of the angle were taken in increments of 3°; covering an angular field of 100°<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> range. The anisotropy (A) of the measured parameter, RRTmax/RRTmin, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) obtained from a Gaussian fit of the RRT as a function of the measured angle are two new mechanical parameter that change with age. Its ratio A/FWHM is a new mechanical parameter that we can use to predict the subjects age since we obtained a p value of &lt; 0.001 for this ratio as a function of age. In this study we will express the skin firming as a ratio of the Anisotropy before and after product application.</p><p num="p0089">Skin viscoelastical measurements were performed as a function the direction with a Reviscometer® (Model RVM 600, Courage Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). The probe is held perpendicular to the skin surface by a hollow cylindrical holder that is attached to the surface of the skin with double stick tape (positioning top). The holder has marks along its periphery at angular intervals of 45°. In our instrument we modified the probe-holder assembly by placing a mm scale on the probe and another on the holder. Then we carried out measurements by rotating the probe within the holder so that the mm lines of the scale would align with each other, this corresponded to making measurements every 3° for a total interval of 100°.</p><p num="p0090">The skin viscoelastical measurements were taken on the upper inner arm of 30 subject. Two sites were chosen in each arm, readings were taken as described above before and 45 minutes after product application. In one of the sites was applied a placebo formulation (no THPED) and in the second site a formulation containing 2.5% of THPED (as described in Example 4), was applied.<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> After the gaussian fit, the Anisotropy ratio, before and after product application, was calculated.</p><p num="p0091">It was found that the THPED formulation decreases the skin anisotropy 3 fold, as compared to 1.5 fold for the placebo formulation. Using a Minitab® software for the statistical analysis comparing THPED formulation against placebo, we obtained a p&lt;0.001. This shows that THPED treated sites can tight and firm the skin and this effect is statistically significant.</p><p num="p0092">Compositions containing DMAE were also tested in the same methodology as described above. The upper inner arms of subjects were treated with products that contained either 0% DMAE (placebo), 0.5% DMAE, 1% DMAE, 2% DMAE, or 3% DMAE. The anisotropy was measured both before and 35 minutes after product application. The anisotropy ratio shows a dose response for DMAE indicating that the contraction of the keratinocytes, as seen in the Confocal Microscopy example (example 3), can firm and tight the skin as well deliver anti-aging benefits to the skin. Table V shows the firming effect (anisotropy ratio) for the DMAE as a function of DMAE concentration in percentage.

Noninflammatory acne is characterized by closed comedones (whiteheads) and open comedones (blackheads), consisting of compact masses of keratin, sebum, and bacteria which dilate the follicular duct. A comedone forms when a pilo-sebaceous duct is obstructed and/or when there is increased production of sebum by a sebaceous gland. Formation of the comedone can be followed by inflammation, resulting from bacterial proliferation and/or overproduction of sebum. Typically, the bacteria are anaerobic bacteria such as Propionibacteria (P. acnes). Inflammatory acne is characterized by papules (pimples), pustules, and nodulocystic lesions which may lead to scarring. Several factors are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of acne including: sebum production, hormonal stimulation, plugged pores, and skin pathogens.<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> Sebum levels are increased in subjects with acne by approximately 70% compared to sebum levels of control subjects.</p><p num="p0118">Human sebum differs in its composition from other mammals. The main lipids in human sebum are triglycerides, wax esters, and squalene (Greene, et al. JID 54, 240-247, 1970). Squalene, for instance is not found in many mammals. Triglyceride, which is a major component of human sebum, is poorly represented in other species and in many (e.g. chimpanzee) appears to be totally absent (Thody, A. J., Shuster, S., Physiolog. Rev. 69, 383-415, 1989). Squalene can be further oxidized to Squalene monohydroperoxide (Sq-OOH), which is the initial product of ultraviolet-peroxidation. This can lead to comedone formation, initiate an inflammatory response, cytotoxicity and comedogenicity (Chiba et al J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2001;15(3):150-158). Therefore decreasing squalene formation in sebum may lead to decreased comedone formation, and the appearance of acne including papules (pimples), pustules, and scarring. However, the main lipids in human sebum also can function to maintain skin hydration as shown by a correlation between sebum content and water content of the skin (Aisen E et al., Acta Derm Venereol. (1997) 77:142-143). Various approaches have been tried to reduce sebum production. For example, topical retinoids have been shown to reduce the synthesis of the main lipids in human sebum (Stewart ME et al., J Invest Dermatol. (1984) 82:74-78); however, non-selective suppression of sebum can lead to dry skin (Shalita AR, et al., Clin Ther. (2004) 26:1865-1873).<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --></p><p num="p0119">The ability of THPED to selectively affect the content of squalene present in human sebum without affecting other components of sebum was illustrated by its ability to selectively reduce the content of squalene present in human skin using the following assay.</p><p num="p0120">The Methods used are as described previously by Pappas et al. (J Invest Dermatol. 2002 Jan; 118(1):164-171). In summary, samples of facial skin (otherwise to be discarded) were obtained from female patients 45-65 years of age. The subjects were healthy females without a history of retinoid or laser treatment or chemotherapy. The specimens were obtained from facial lift surgery within 5 hours from the end of the surgery. Two mm biopsy punches were taken from tissues rich in sebaceous glands and cultured in serum free medium. The medium consisted of DMEM and F12 (3:1) (Gibco San Diego, CA) as described previously (Guy and Kealy, Dermatology. 1998;196(1):16-20) containing, L-glutamine, penicilin-streptomycin, sodium Pyruvate, a selenium-insulin-transferrin mixture, and trace elements (Gibco San Diego, CA) and 3,3,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Finally, prior to incubation of biopsies, the concentration of THPED was adjusted to 25 µM and C14-labelled acetate was added (2 µCi/ml).</p><p num="p0121">For each experimental point, 5 biopsy punches were homogenized in 2ml of CHCl<sub>2</sub>: MeOH (2:1) until a milky homogenate was obtained without the presence of visual debris. The homogenate was transferred to a glass tube containing 1ml of 0.88% potassium chloride. The homogenizer was then rinsed with 2mls of the extraction<!-- EPO <DP n="56"> --> solvent twice, and these washes were added to the combined extract. After phase separation, the aqueous phase was removed and discarded while the remaining total organic extract was evaporated under a gentle stream of argon prior to HPTLC analysis.</p><p num="p0122">The lipid components extracted from the explanted glands were analyzed by chromatographic separation on 10 X 20cm Whatman HPTLC Silica G plates that had been previously charged with chloroform, heated in a vacuum oven at 105°C for 30min and cooled to room temperature in a dessicator. After spotting the lipids that were dissolved in CHC13: MetOH (2:1), the plates were developed three times, as previously reported (3), as follows: 1) phase Hexane to the top, 2) Toluene to the top and 3) Hexane/Ether/Acetic Acid (70:30:1) 10cm from the top. Between each mobile phase, a 15min drying time at room temperature in a standard fume hood was carried out to ensure complete evaporation of the solvent. Squalene, waxes and sterol esters are separated during the first two phases while the various polar lipids are resolved during the third phase.</p><p num="p0123">Biopsy punches from human facial skin in the presence of THPED demonstrated decreased accumulation of squalene without substantially affecting other components of sebum such as Triglycerides.
