multi-plate clutch, a gear mechanism, and a mechanism controlling these
elements. The torque transmission capacity is automatically set according to
the speed of automobile and the degree of load. Modern automatic
transmissions further comprise a lockup clutch mounted to the torque
converter, so as to improve fuel economy. The use of the lockup clutch
enables engine torque to be transmitted to the automatic transmission
according to driving conditions in addition to the driving force transmitted
through a lubricating oil. However, since the torque variation produced by the
operation of the lockup clutch sometimes disturbs passengers due to shudder,
the lockup clutch is generally set to operate only under high speed driving
conditions giving less torque variation.</p><p num="0002">Under low speed driving conditions as when an automobile starts, loss of
driving force transmission is caused between the engine output revolution and
the transmission input revolution. Therefore, enough improvement of fuel
economy is not attained. Accordingly, automatic transmissions adopt a slip
control system by which the lockup mechanism can operate under the low
speed driving conditions and the transmission loss can be reduced. However,
when the clutch is subjected to control by the slip control system, abnormal
vibration of the body of automobile (i.e., shudder) takes place on the friction 
surface of the lockup clutch. At low road speeds vehicle operation is rough and
engine vibration is transmitted through the drive train. Rough operation and
engine vibration are not acceptable to drivers.</p><p num="0003">Shudder occurs when the sliding rate (V) in the lockup clutch increases and the
coefficient of friction (¬µ) decreases. Thus, it is desirable to employ a lubricating
oil (automatic transmission fluid) which shows a favorable ¬µ-V character, i.e.,
the friction coefficient increases when the sliding rate increases, and keeps the
favorable ¬µ-V character for a prolonged period of time, i.e., prolonged shudder
inhibition performance.</p><p num="0004">JASO (Japanese Automobile Standard Organization) M349:2001 describes a
standard oil T-III which shows standard shudder inhibition performance and
transmissive torque capacity. However, there is given no information with
respect to formulation of the T-III standard oil.</p><p num="0005">Prolonged shudder inhibition can be attained by incorporating a friction modifier
(generally, friction decreasing agent). However, if too much friction modifier is
incorporated into a lubricating oil, the friction coefficient of the wet clutch
extremely decreases and hence enough transmissive torque capacity cannot
be obtained.</p><p num="0006">U.S. Patent No. 4,948,523 discloses a lubricating composition, preferably
essentially free of zinc dihydrocarbyldithiophosphate compounds, and
optionally free of chlorine containing silver lubricity agents, comprising a major
proportion of an oil of lubricating viscosity and a minor amount of a silver

combination comprising a compound having the general formula R‚ÄïNH<sub>2</sub> with
oil-soluble phosphorus compounds, an ashless dispersant, and, optionally,
other amine containing friction modifiers provide lubricating fluids which exhibit

lubricating oil composition for automatic transmissions in internal combustion
engines. The lubricating oil composition employing the additive compound of
the present invention has a high transmissive torque capacity and prolonged
shudder inhibition when used as an automatic transmission fluid (ATF) in
automatic transmissions of internal combustion engines.</p><p num="0014">It is desirable that an automatic transmission fluid not only should show a high
shudder inhibiting ability when the transmission fluid is first used, but also
should keep the high shudder inhibiting ability for a prolonged period of time
without substantial decrease of the inhibiting ability and further should show a
high transmissive torque capacity.</p><p num="0015">Accordingly, the present invention relates to an additive compound employable

borated or a mixture thereof.</p><p num="0017">The present invention furthermore relates to a lubricating oil composition
comprising a major amount of base oil of lubricating viscosity and a minor
amount of the reaction product of a linear or branched, saturated or
unsaturated monovalent aliphatic acid having 8 to 22 carbon atoms, urea, and
polyalkylenepolyamine, wherein the reaction product is non-borated, borated or
a mixture thereof.</p><p num="0018">The present invention further relates to a method of reducing shudder in an
automatic transmission of an internal combustion engine by adding the
lubricating oil composition of the present invention to an automatic
transmission and operating the engine.</p><p num="0019">Among other factors, the present invention is based on the surprising discovery
that an additive compound comprising a non-borated and/or borated reaction
product, in which the reaction product is obtained by reacting a linear or
branched, saturated or unsaturated monovalent aliphatic acid having 8 to 22

The lubricating oil composition employing the additive compound is useful as a
method for reducing shudder when used as an automatic transmission fluid.

oil fraction particularly those having a kinematic viscosity at 100¬∞ Centigrade
(C) and about 4 centistokes (cSt) to about 20 cSt. Hydrocarbon synthetic oils
may include, for example, oils prepared from the polymerization of ethylene,
polyalphaolefin or PAO, or from hydrocarbon synthesis procedures using
carbon monoxide and hydrogen gases such as in a Fisher-Tropsch process. A
preferred base oil is one that comprises little, if any, heavy fraction; e.g., little, if
any, lube oil fraction of viscosity about 20 cSt or higher at about 100 C. Oils
used as the base oil will be selected or blended depending on the desired end
use and the additives in the finished oil to give the desired grade of engine oil,
e.g. a lubricating oil composition having an SAE Viscosity Grade of 0W, 0W-20,
0W-30, 0W-40, 0W-50, 0W-60, 5W, 5W-20, 5W-30, 5W-40, 5W-50, 5W-60,
10W, 10W-20. 10W-30, 10W-40, 10W-50, 15W, 15W-20, 15W-30, or
15W-40. </p><p num="0035">There are no specific conditions with respect to the base oil, provided that the
base oil is selected from the base stocks generally employed for preparing
lubricating oil compositions. The base oil may be derived from natural
lubricating oils, synthetic lubricating oils or mixtures thereof. Suitable base oil
includes base stocks obtained by isomerization of synthetic wax and slack wax,
as well as hydrocrackate base stocks produced by hydrocracking (rather than
solvent extracting) the aromatic and polar components of the crude. Suitable
base oils include those in all API categories I, II, III, IV and V as defined in API
Publication 1509, 14th Edition, Addendum I, December 1998. Saturates levels
and viscosity indices for Group I, II and III base oils are listed in Table 1. Group
IV base oils are polyalphaolefins (PAO). Group V base oils include all other
base oils not included in Group I, II, III, or IV. Group III base oils are preferred.

oils, castor oils and lard oil), petroleum oils, mineral oils, and oils derived from
coal or shale.</p> <p num="0037">Synthetic oils may include hydrocarbon oils and halo-substituted hydrocarbon
oils such as polymerized and inter-polymerized olefins, alkylbenzenes,
polyphenyls, alkylated diphenyl ethers, alkylated diphenyl sulfides, as well as
their derivatives, analogues and homologues thereof, and the like. Synthetic
lubricating oils also include alkylene oxide polymers, interpolymers, copolymers
and derivatives thereof wherein the terminal hydroxyl groups have been
modified by esterification, etherification, etc. Another suitable class of synthetic
lubricating oils comprises the esters of dicarboxylic acids with a variety of
alcohols. Esters useful as synthetic oils also include those made from C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>12</sub>
monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyol ethers. Tri-alkyl phosphate ester
oils such as those exemplified by tri-n-butyl phosphate and tri-iso-butyl
phosphate are also suitable for use as base oils.</p> <p num="0038">Silicon-based oils (such as the polyalkyl-, polyaryl-, polyalkoxy-, or polyaryloxy-siloxane
oils and silicate oils) comprise another useful class of synthetic
lubricating oils. Other synthetic lubricating oils include liquid esters of
phosphorus-containing acids, polymeric tetrahydrofurans, polyalphaolefins, and
the like.</p> <p num="0039">The base oil may be derived from unrefined, refined, rerefined oils, or mixtures
thereof. Unrefined oils are obtained directly from a natural source or synthetic
source (e.g., coal, shale, or tar sand bitumen) without further purification or
treatment. Examples of unrefined oils include a shale oil obtained directly from
a retorting operation, a petroleum oil obtained directly from distillation, or an
ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process, each of which may
then be used without further treatment. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined
oils except that refined oils have been treated in one or more purification steps
to improve one or more properties. Suitable purification techniques include 
distillation, hydrocracking, hydrotreating, dewaxing, solvent extraction, acid or
base extraction, filtration, and percolation, all of which are known to those
skilled in the art. Rerefined oils are obtained by treating used oils in processes
similar to those used to obtain the refined oils. These rerefined oils are also
known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed
by techniques for removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products.</p><p num="0040">Base oil derived from the hydroisomerization of wax may also be used, either
alone or in combination with the aforesaid natural and/or synthetic base oil.</p><p num="0041">Such wax isomerate oil is produced by the hydroisomerization of natural or
synthetic waxes or mixtures thereof over a hydroisomerization catalyst.</p><p num="0042">It is preferred to use a major amount of base oil in the lubricating oil of the
present invention. A major amount of base oil as defined herein comprises 40
wt % or more. Preferred amounts of base oil comprise 40 to 99.9 wt %,
preferably greater than 50 to 97 wt %, more preferably 60 to 97 wt % of the
lubricating oil composition. (When weight percent is used herein, it is based on
the total weight percent of the lubricating oil composition unless otherwise
specified.)</p><p num="0043">The additive composition of the present invention in the lubricating oil
composition will be in a minor amount compared to the base oil of lubricating
viscosity. Generally, it will be in an amount from 0.1 to 10 wt %, preferably from
0.3 to 5 wt % and more preferably from 0.3 to 2.0 wt % based on the total
weight of the lubricating oil composition.</p><p num="0044">The lubricating oil composition of the present invention can further contain
various lubricating oil additives available in the art. Examples of the optionally
incorporable additives include viscosity index improvers, ashless dispersants,
metal-containing detergents, anti-wear agents, friction modifiers, oxidation
inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, seal swelling agents, dyes, and pour point 
depressants. Particularly preferred additive is diphenyl hydrogen phosphite
which is known as an anti-wear agent.</p><p num="0045">A number of the above-mentioned optionally incorporable additives are well
known. Details of such additives are described below.</p><heading><u style="single">Viscosity Index Improver</u></heading><p num="0046">Examples of the viscosity index improvers include non-dispersant type viscosity
index improvers such as copolymers of various methacrylic acid esters and one
or more other monomers and their hydrogenated products and dispersant type
viscosity index improvers such as copolymers of various methacrylic acid
esters and nitrogen-containing monomers. Other non-dispersant type or
dispersant type viscosity index improvers such as copolymers of ethylene and
Œ±-olefins (e.g., propylene, 1-butene, and 1-pentene) and their hydrogenated
products, and polyacrylic acid esters are also useful in the present invention.</p><p num="0047">The lubricating oil composition of the present invention generally contains a
viscosity index improver in an amount of 1 to 20 wt. %, preferably 1 to 8 wt. %.</p><heading><u style="single">Ashless Dispersant</u></heading><p num="0048">Alkenyl- or alkyl-succinimide or its derivative is the preferred ashless
dispersant. The alkenyl- or alkyl-group can be derived from polyolefin. The
nitrogen-atom containing compound is preferably contained in the lubricating
oil composition in an amount of 0.01 to 0.3 wt. % in terms of the nitrogen
content. A representative succinimide can be prepared by the reaction between
succinic anhydride having a high molecular weight alkenyl or alkyl substituent
group with polyalkylenepolyamine containing 4 to 10 nitrogen atoms (average,
preferably 5 to 7 nitrogen atoms) in one molecule. The high molecular weight
alkenyl or alkyl substituent group is preferably derived from polyolefin having a
number average molecular weight of approx. 900 to 5,000. A particularly
preferred polyolefin is polybutene. </p><p num="0049">The process for preparing the polybutenylsuccinic anhydride by the reaction
between polybutene and maleic anhydride is generally performed by a
chlorination method utilizing chlorine. While this reaction is advantageous in
giving a high reaction yield, it has disadvantageous feature in that a large
amount (for instance, approx. 2,000 ppm) of chlorine remains in the finally
obtained succinimide product. In contrast, a thermal reaction process utilizing
no chlorine gives a final reaction product having extremely low chlorine content
(such as 40 ppm or less). It is known that an improved thermal reaction
process employing a highly reactive polybutene (containing at least approx.
50% of methylvinylidene structure) in place of the conventional polybutene
(containing mainly Œ≤-olefin structure) gives a high reaction yield. The improved
thermal reaction process is further advantageous because a reaction ratio of
the polybutene increases and the resulting dispersant contains the effective
product (succinimide) in a high concentration. Accordingly, it is preferred that
the polybutenylsuccinic anhydride is produced from the highly reactive
polybutene converted by a thermal process and the resulting
polybutenylsuccinic anhydride is converted into succinimide by the reaction
with polyalkylenepolyamine containing 4 to 10 nitrogen atoms (average per one
molecule). The resulting succinimide can be further converted to a modified
succinimide by a further reaction with boric acid, alcohol, aldehyde, ketone,
alkylphenol, cyclic carbonate, organic acids, or inorganic acids such as
phosphoric acid. From the thermal stability and oxidation stability, particularly
preferred is a boron-containing alkenyl- or alkyl-succinimide which is produced
by the reaction with boric acid or a boron-containing compound.</p><p num="0050">Other ashless additives such as alkenylbenzylamine compounds and
alkenylsuccinic acid esters can be employed independently or in combination
with the above-mentioned alkenyl- or alkyl-succinimide or its derivative.</p><heading><u style="single">Metal-Containing Detergent</u></heading><p num="0051">Generally, a metal-containing detergent, i.e., metal atom-containing detergent,
having a total base number of 10 to 500 mg¬∑KOH/g is employed in an amount

alkaline earth metal salts of petroleum sulfonic acids, alkylbenzenesulfonic
acids, and alkyloxybenzenesulfonic acids or their over-based products. The
alkaline earth metal salts preferably are Mg salts or Ca salts. The metal-containing
detergents can be employed singly or in combination. Otherwise,
phenate sulfide or salicylate can be employed singly or in combination.</p><heading><u style="single">Anti-Wear Agent and Friction Modifier</u></heading><p num="0052">It is preferred that the lubricating oil composition of the present invention
further contains diphenyl hydrogen phosphite which serves as an anti-wear
agent and a friction modifier. The static friction coefficient retention of the
lubricating oil composition of the present invention is further improved by the
incorporation of diphenyl hydrogen phosphite. The diphenyl hydrogen
phosphite is generally contained in the lubricating oil composition of the
present invention in an amount of 0.01 to 2 wt. %, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 wt. %.</p><p num="0053">Other phosphoric acid esters, phosphoric acid amine salts, phosphorous acid
esters, and phosphorous acid amine salts can be incorporated into the
lubricating oil composition of the present invention independently or in addition
to diphenyl hydrogen phosphite. Examples of these compounds include

larger than 0.100 means that the transmission torque capacity is high, and a
further larger ¬µt value means a higher transmission torque capacity.

the present invention (Examples 4 to 6) show a long shudder inhibition life
(which means a long shudder inhibition capacity retention) and a high ¬µl value
such as a value exceeding 0.130 (which means a high transmissive torque
capacity). In contrast, the comparative lubricating oil composition containing
neither the amide compound nor the imide compound (Comparative Example
A) shows a short shudder inhibition life while the ¬µt value is high. The
comparative lubricating oil compositions containing a conventional amide
compound or imide compound (Comparative Examples B and C) show a low ¬µl
value and only a slightly longer shudder inhibition life (longer than the life of the
lubricating oil composition of Comparative Example A) but shorter than the
lubricating oil compositions of the present invention (Examples 4 to 6).</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>An additive compound comprising the reaction product of a linear or
