bioleach plants which are currently in operation treating sulphide minerals typically operate within the temperature range of 40°C to 50°C and rely on sparging air to the bioleach reactors to provide the required oxygen</p><p num="p0004">Operation at this relatively low temperature and the use of air to supply oxygen limit the rate of sulphide mineral oxidation that can be achieved For example carrolite and enargite are relatively slow leaching at temperatures below 50°C and treatment at or below this temperature results in poor and sub-economic metal extraction</p><p num="p0005">The use of high temperatures between 50°C and 100°C greatly increases the rate of sulphide mineral leaching</p><p num="p0006">The solubility of oxygen is however limited at high temperatures and the rate of sulphide mineral leaching becomes limited In the case of using air for the supply of oxygen the effect of limited oxygen solubility is such that the rate of sulphide mineral leaching becomes dependent

As used herein the expression "oxygen enriched gas" is intended to include a gas, eg air, which contains in excess of 21 % oxygen by volume This is an oxygen content greater than the oxygen content of air The expression "pure oxygen" is intended to include a gas which contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume</p> <p num="p0010">Preferably the feed gas which is supplied to the slurry contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume le is substantially pure oxygen</p><p num="p0011">The method may include the step of maintaining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a desired range which may be determined by the operating conditions and the type of microorganisms used for leaching The applicant has established that a lower limit for the dissolved oxygen concentration to sustain microorganism growth and mineral oxidation, is in the range of from 0 2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 4 0 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> On the other hand if the dissolved oxygen concentration is too high then microorganism growth is inhibited The upper threshold concentration also depends on the genus and strain of microorganism used in the leaching process and typically is in the range of from 4 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0012">Thus, preferably, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry is maintained in the range of from 0 2 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p> <p num="p0013">The method may include the steps cf determining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry and, in response thereto, of controlling at least one of the following the oxygen content of the feed gas, the rate of supply of the feed gas to the slurry, and the rate of feed of slurry to a reactor</p> <p num="p0014">The dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry may be determined in any appropriate way, e g by one or more of the following by direct measurement of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, by measurement of the oxygen content in gas above the slurry, and indirectly by measurement of the oxygen content in off-gas from the slurry, taking into account the rate of oxygen supply, whether in gas enriched or pure form to the slurry, and other relevant factors

The method may include the step of controlling the carbon content of the slurry This may be achieved by one or more of the following the addition of carbon dioxide gas to the slurry, and the addition of other carbonaceous material to the slurry</p> <p num="p0015">The method may extend to the step of controlling the carbon dioxide content of the feed gas to the slurry in the range of from 0 5% to 5% by volume A suitable figure is of the order of 1 % to 1 5% by volume The level of the carbon dioxide is chosen to maintain high rates of microorganism growth and sulphide mineral oxidation</p><p num="p0016">The bioleaching process is preferably carried out at an elevated temperature As stated hereinbefore the bioleaching rate increases with an increase in operating temperature Clearly the microorganisms which are used for bioleaching are determined by the operating temperature and vice versa As the addition of oxygen enriched gas or substantially pure oxygen to the slurry has a cost factor it is desirable to operate at a temperature which increases the leaching rate by an amount which more than compensates for the increase in operating cost Thus, preferably, the bioleaching is carried out at a temperature in excess of 40°C</p><p num="p0017">The bioleaching may be carried out at a temperature of up to 100<sup>C</sup>C or more and preferably is carried out at a temperature which lies in a range of from 60°C to 85°C</p><p num="p0018">In one form of the invention the method includes the step of bioleaching the slurry at a temperature of up to 45°C using mesophile microorganisms These microorganisms may, for example, be selected from the following genus groups Aadithiobacillus ('formerly Thiobacillus), Leptospπllum, Ferromicrobium and Acidiphilium</p><p num="p0019">In order to operate at this temperature the said microorganisms may for example, be selected from the following species</p><p num="p0020">Acidithiobacillus caldus (Thiobacillus caldus), Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (Thiobacillus thiooxidans), Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans) Acidithiobacillus acidophiius (Thiobacillus

Various techniques may be used for controlling the supply of oxygen to the slurry and hence for controlling the dissolved oxygen content or concentration in the slurry at a desired value Use may for example be made of valves which are operated manually For more accurate control use may be made of an automatic control system These techniques are known in the art and are not further described herein</p><p num="p0037">As has been indicated oxygen and carbon dioxide may be added to the slurry in accordance with predetermined criteria Although the addition of these materials may be based on expected demand and measurement of other performance parameters, such as ιron(ll) concentration, it is preferred to make use of suitable measurement probes to sample the actual values of the critical parameters</p><p num="p0038">For example use may be made of a dissolved oxygen probe to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry directly To achieve this the probe is immersed in the slurry The dissolved oxygen concentration may be measured indirectly by using a probe in the reactor off-gas or by transmitting a sample of the off-gas, at regular intervals, to an oxygen gas analyser Again it is pointed out that measuring techniques of this type are known in the art and accordingly any appropriate technique can be used</p><p num="p0039">A preferred approach to the control aspect is to utilise one or more probes to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, whether directly or indirectly The probes produce one or more control signals which are used to control the operation of a suitable valve or valves, eg solenoid valves, automatically so that the supply of oxygen to an air stream which is being fed to the slurry is varied automatically in accordance with real time measurements of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry</p><p num="p0040">Although it is preferred to control the addition of oxygen to a gas stream which is fed to the slurry a reverse approach may be adopted in that the oxygen supply rate to the reactor vessel may be maintained substantially constant and the rate of supply of the sulphide mineral slurry to the reactor vessel may be varied to achieve a desired dissolved oxygen concentration</p><p num="p0041">The invention is not limited to the actual control technique employed and is intended to extend to variations of the aforegoing approaches and to any equivalent process

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p><p num="p0042">The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a portion of a plant in which the invention is carried out, and Figures 2, 3 and 4 reflect various results and parameters obtained from operating a bioreactor using the principles of the invention</p><p num="p0043">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</p><p num="p0044">General Principles</p><p num="p0045">The limitation of low oxygen solubility during bioleaching, using air, at high temperatures, which in turn limits the rate of reaction, requires enrichment of the air with oxygen le air with an oxygen content greater than 21% by volume, or the use of pure oxygen (defined as being greater than 85% oxygen by volume) The use of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen overcomes the limited rate of reaction due to oxygen supply constraints, but has two major disadvantages a) the provision of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen is expensive and requires a high utilisation (&gt;60%) of the oxygen to warrant the additional expense <sup>(3)</sup>, and b) if the oxygen level in solution becomes too high microorganism growth is prevented and sulphide mineral bioleaching stops <sup>(4)</sup></p><p num="p0046">Therefore, in order to realise the benefits of high rates of sulphide mineral leaching at high temperatures in commercial bioleaching plants, the drawbacks of requiring expensive oxygen and the risk of failure if the dissolved oxygen levels become too high must be overcome</p><p num="p0047">The bioleaching of sulphide minerals at an elevated temperature results in a high rate of sulphide mineral oxidation, but is dependent on the supply of oxygen and carbon dioxide to maintain high rates of sulphide mineral oxidation and of microorganism growth at adequate rates The absorption of oxygen and carbon 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
dioxide in the bioleaching reactor is limited, in each case, by the rate of mass transfer from the gas phase into the solution phase For oxygen the rate of oxygen absorption is defined by equation (1) as follows</p><p num="p0048">R = M (C<sup>*</sup> - C<sub>L</sub>) (1) where R = Oxygen demand as mass (kg) per unit volume (m<sup>3</sup>) per unit tιme(s) (kg/m<sup>3</sup>/s),</p><p num="p0049">M = Oxygen mass transfer coefficient in reciprocal seconds (s<sup>'</sup> ), C<sup>*</sup> = Saturated dissolved oxygen concentration as mass (kg) per unit volume (m<sup>3</sup>) (kg/m<sup>3</sup>), and C<sub>L</sub> = Dissolved oxygen concentration in solution as mass (kg) per unit volume (m<sup>3</sup>) (kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</p><p num="p0050">The factor (C<sup>*</sup> - C<sub>L</sub>) is referred to as the oxygen driving force A similar equation may be used to describe the rate of carbon dioxide supply to the solution If the sulphide mineral oxidation rate is increased the oxygen demand increases proportionately To meet a higher oxygen demand either the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (M) or the oxygen driving force (C<sup>*</sup>-C<sub>L</sub>) must be increased</p><p num="p0051">An increase in the oxygen mass transfer coefficient may be achieved by increasing the power input to the bioleach reactor mixer This improves gas dispersion in the sulphide mineral slurry With this approach, however an increase in the oxygen mass transfer coefficient of, for example, 40% requires an increase in the power input to the mixer by a factor of as much as 200%, with a commensurate increase in operating costs</p><p num="p0052">The oxygen driving force may be increased by increasing the saturated dissolved oxygen concentration C* and reducing the dissolved oxygen content or concentration C<sub>L</sub></p><p num="p0053">Microorganism population growth is limited or prevented if the dissolved oxygen concentration C<sup>*</sup> reaches too high a level A concentration level above 4 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> has been found to be detrimental to Sulfolobus-hke strains Certain Acidithiobacillus strains, however have been found to be tolerant to dissolved oxygen concentrations of up to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup><!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
The applicant has established that a lower limit for the dissolved oxygen concentration to sustain microorganism growth and mineral oxidation is in the range of from 0 2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 4 0 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> Thus, in order to provide an adequate, or optimum, supply of oxygen, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the sulphide mineral slurry must be monitored and, where appropriate the addition of oxygen to the sulphide mineral slurry must be controlled in order to maintain the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration in solution at a value of from 0 2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 4 0 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0054">On the other hand the dissolved oxygen concentration must not exceed an upper threshold value at which microorganism growth is prevented It is pointed out that the upper threshold concentration depends on the genus and strain of microorganism used in the bioleaching process A typical upper threshold value is in the range of from 4 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0055">As has been previously indicated the rate of sulphide mineral oxidation which can be achieved when operating at a relatively low temperature of the order of from 40°C to 55°C, is limited In order to increase the rate of oxidation it is desirable to make use of thermophiles and to operate at temperatures in excess of 60°C Any suitable microorganism capable of operating within this temperature range may be used The optimum operating temperature is dependent on the genus and type of microorganism used Thus moderate thermophiles of the type Sulfobacillus are suitable for operating at a temperature of up to 65°C Thermophiles of the type Sulfolobus are suitable for operating at temperatures of from 60°C to at least 85°C Sulfolobus metallicus, for example, shows optimal growth in the temperature range of from 65°C to 70°C</p><p num="p0056">The applicant has established that the operation of the bioleaching process, using a gas enriched with oxygen, or pure oxygen, as the oxidant, at elevated temperatures of from 40°C to 85°C increases the specific sulphide oxidation duty of the reactor considerably, results in an unexpected and significantly enhanced oxygen mass transfer rate, increases the oxygen utilisation, providing that the dissolved oxygen concentration is controlled above the point where microorganism growth and mineral oxidation are prevented and below the point at which microorganism growth is inhibited, and the overall power required for the oxidation of sulphide minerals is significantly reduced 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
The method of the invention represents a significant improvement compared to a bioleach operation carried out at a temperature of from 40°C to 45°C with air</p><p num="p0057">The controlled addition of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen directly into the bioreactor improves the oxygen utilisation efficiency The oxygen utilisation for a conventional commercial bioleach plant (at least 100m<sup>3</sup> in volume) operating at from 40°C to 45°C with air may be expected to achieve a maximum oxygen utilisation factor of from 40% to 50% Consequently only 40% to 50% of the total mass of oxygen supplied to the bioleach plant is used to oxidise the sulphide minerals With the method of the invention the oxygen utilisation is significantly higher, of the order of from 60% to 95% The higher oxygen utilisation is achieved by controlled oxygen addition and results from the enhanced oxygen mass transfer rate and by operating at low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the solution phase</p><p num="p0058">It will be appreciated that although high oxygen demand in bioleach reactors has come about primarily by the use of higher temperatures, rapidly leaching sulphide minerals at temperatures below 60°C, using mesophile or moderate thermophile microorganisms, will have similarly high oxygen demands The method of the invention is therefore not restricted to suit thermophiles or extreme thermophiles, but also mesophile and moderate thermophile microorganisms</p><p num="p0059">Another advantage of using air enriched with oxygen or pure oxygen is that the evaporation losses are reduced because there is less inert gas removing water vapour from the top of the reactor This is particularly important in areas where water is scarce or expensive</p><p num="p0060">In carrying out the method of the invention the temperature of the slurry in the bioleach vessel or reactor may be controlled in any suitable way known in the art In one example the bioleach reactor is insulated and heating takes place by means of energy which is released by the oxidation of sulphides The temperature of the slurry is regulated using any suitable cooling system, for example an internal cooling system
