modified polyolefin composition with excellent adherence to
nonpolar sheets, films and moldings of polypropylene,
polyethylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene-propylene-diene
copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer,etc., with
excellent solvent resistance, oil resistance and weather
resistance, with no tack, and also with excellent cohesion.</p><p num="0002">Because of low price, and many excellent properties such as
moldability, chemical resistance, water resistance and electrical
characteristics, polyolefins such as polypropylene and
polyethylene are used widely in recent years as sheets, films,
moldings, etc. Different from polar substrates such as
polyurethane resin, polyamide resin, acrylic resin and polyester
resin, however, polyolefin substrates are nonpolar and
crystalline, leading to drawbacks of difficult paintability and
adhesion.</p><p num="0003">So far, modified polyolefins obtainable by modifying
polyolefins with unsaturated carboxylic acid and/or acid
anhydride, and further acid-modified chlorinated polyolefins
obtainable by chlorinating them have been used as paint
additives, primers and adhesives, because of excellent adherence 
to said nonpolar substrates.</p><p num="0004">However, conventional acid-modified polyolefins represented
by maleic anhydride-modified polyolefins have drawbacks of poorer
adherence to non-polar substrates, more liability to cause
cohesive failure, stronger tackiness, etc. compared with
chlorination type modified polyolefins. Moreover, even chlorinated
polyolefins with excellent adherence also have drawbacks of poor
weather resistance etc. and, in addition, from recent upsurge of
environmental problems, their uses have also become to be
restricted. Based on such background, the development of novel
chlorine-free resin with adherence to nonpolar substrates equal
to or more than that of chlorinated polyolefin, and also with
excellent physical properties such as tackiness and cohesion has
been expected.</p><p num="0005">As one of the reasons why maleic anhydride-modified
polyolefin is in short of physical properties, low activity of
maleic anhydride on radical polymerization can be mentioned. In
order to use maleic anhydride-modified polyolefin for the uses of
adhesives, primers, paint additives, etc. for nonpolar
substrates, at which the invention aims, it is required to graft
a considerable quantity of maleic anhydrides onto polyolefin.
However, because of low grafting rate by usual modification
method, necessary physical properties cannot be obtained. If
employing severe conditions in attempt to raise the grafting
rate, then remarkable decrease in molecular weight results,
leading to decreased physical properties. In the uses of 
compatibilizers, moldings, adhesives, etc., such techniques for
obtaining modified polyolefin with high molecular weight and high
grafting rate that use of maleic anhydride and styrenic monomer
in combination are known, and, for example, US3708555, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. Hei 1-221475, Hei 8-3415,
48873, 208907, Hei 10-36456, 306269, etc. are exemplified,
including the literatures described in G. Moad: Prog. Polym.
Sci., 24, 81 (1999). With these techniques, styrenic monomer
equal to or more quantity than maleic anhydride is used.
Moreover, in US5021510, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
Nos. Hei 3-227341, Hei 4-46946, Hei 6-122738, Hei 9-40724, etc.,
the ratio of maleic anhydride to styrenic monomer is not
particularly described, or the techniques cover very broad range.</p><p num="0006">However, in the uses, at which the invention aims, these
conventional techniques could not be utilized from the facts that
the solvent resistance, oil resistance and weather resistance
decreased remarkably because of a large quantity of styrenic
components contained. Moreover, in the case of low content of
propylene in raw material polyolefin or in the case of high
content of styrenic component in modified polyolefin, the
adherence to nonpolar substrates decreased, which made it
impossible similarly to utilize for those uses.</p><p num="0007">The purpose of the invention lies in providing a novel
chlorine-free modified polyolefin with excellent adherence to
polyolefinic resin moldings, with excellent solvent resistance,
oil resistance and weather resistance, with no tack, and also 
with excellent cohesion.</p><p num="0008">As a result of diligent investigations for solving this
subject, the inventors have found that, by using particular
polyolefin for raw material and further using particular
quantities of maleic anhydride and styrenic monomer for graft
polymerization, thus by controlling the structure and molecular
weight of modified product, the adherence to nonpolar substrates,
solvent resistance, oil resistance, weather resistance,
elimination of tack and enhancement of cohesion, etc. can be
achieved at the same time, leading to the invention based on this
knowledge.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0009">As described, according to the invention, following (1)

point to nonpolar sheets, films or moldings of polypropylene,
polyethylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene-propylene-diene
copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, etc. Also,
they include surface-treated ones of these substrates with
plasma, corona or the like.</p><p num="0011">The polyolefins that become the raw material of modified
polyolefin to be used in the invention are polypropylene,
ethylene-propylene copolymer and ethylene-propylene-butene
copolymer.</p><p num="0012">The composition ratio of propylene in the polyolefins that
become the raw material of modified polyolefin is preferable to
be not less than 50%, more preferably not less than 60% to not
more than 98%. If under 50%, then the adherence to propylene 
and polyolefin substrates is poor.</p><p num="0013">The usable molecular weight of polyolefin can be selected
freely so as the weight average molecular weight of modified
polyolefin to become 30,000 to 150,000, but, even a polyolefin
with weight average molecular weight of over 150,000 becomes
usable by the publicly known methods for adjusting the molecular
weight to a suitable range by degrading in the presence of heat
or radical, and others.</p><p num="0014">As the styrenic monomer to be used in the invention,
styrene is used most preferably, but unsaturated aromatic
monomers such as o-,p-, α-methylstyrene and divinylbenzene can
also be used.</p><p num="0015">In the invention, it is required to graft maleic anhyride
and styrenic monomer in amounts of 0.5 to 15.0% and 0.1 to 7.5%
, respectively, to the weight of raw material polyolefin. In
addition, it is required to control the ratio of grafting weight
of maleic anhyride to grafting weight of styrenic monomer so as
to become not less than 2 to not more than 5. If the grafting
weight of maleic anhyride is under 0.5%, then the solubility
into solvent and the compatibility with other resins are poor,
and, if over 15.0%, then a large quantity of maleic anhyrides
are used, resulting in the generation of much residual monomer,
which is unpreferable. If the grafting weight of styrenic monomer
is under 0.1%, then effect of suppressing the drop of molecular
weight and effect of increasing the grafting rate of maleic
anhyride cannot be obtained, thus generating much residual maleic 
anhyride monomer. If over 7.5%, then the solvent resistance, oil
resistance and weather resistance decrease remarkably or the
adherence decreases, which is unpreferable. Similarly, with
regard to the ratio of grafting weight of maleic
anhyride to grafting weight of styrenic monomer, too, if it is
over 5, then effect of suppressing the drop of molecular weight
and effect of increasing the grafting rate of maleic anhyride
cannot be obtained, thus generating much residual maleic anhyride
monomer, and, if under 2, then the solvent resistance, oil
resistance and weather resistance decrease remarkably or the
adherence decreases, which is unpreferable.</p><p num="0016">In the invention, the grafting reaction can be performed
irrespective of the presence of radical initiator, but it is more
preferable to use the initiator, and use of organic peroxides,
for example, benzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, lauroyl
peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, etc. is
preferable. The type and the use level of radical initiator can
be selected appropriately depending on the reaction conditions,
but it is desirable to use around 0.1 to 5 wt.%. If under this
level, then the grafting reaction rate decreases, and, even if
over that, the drop of grafting reaction rate and the side
reactions like internal crosslinking and decreasing of molecular
weight can result.</p><p num="0017">The grafting reaction of maleic anhyride and styrenic
monomer onto polyolefin raw material is possible to perform by
publicly known methods, for example, the solution method wherein 
raw material polyolefin is dissolved into solvent such as
toluene, to which radical initiator, maleic anhyride and
styrenic monomer are added, and the melt method wherein,
employing Banbury mixer, kneader, extruder, etc., radical
initiator, maleic anhyride and styrenic monomer are added to
molten raw material polyolefin, and the like are mentioned. The
order, method, etc. of adding maleic anhyride, styrenic monomer
and radical initiator can be selected appropriately. Moreover, it
is also possible to remove residual monomers by providing a
pressure-reducing process at the time of completion of reaction.</p><p num="0018">The weight average molecular weight of modified polyolefin
obtained is 30,000 to 150,000, preferably 30,000 to 120,000. If
under 30,000, then the adherence to nonpolar substrates and the
cohesion are poor, and, if over 150,000, the workability and the
solubility into solvent decrease due to the increase of
viscosity.</p><p num="0019">The weight average molecular weight of modified polyolefin
can be determined by means of GPC (gel permeation chromatography)
etc. Moreover, the grafting rate of maleic anhyride and styrenic
monomer can be measured by extracting them using MEK, acetone,
MEK-methanol mixed solvent, or the like, and then by using
titration, FT-IR, NMR, etc.</p><p num="0020">The inventive modified polyolefin can be used as an
adhesive, primer, paint binder resin and ink binder resin for
nonpolar substrates. It can be used in the forms adapted to uses
such as solution,powder and sheet. Moreover, if needed, 
additives, for example, antioxidant, light stabilizer, ultraviolet
absorber, pigment, dye, inorganic filler, etc. may also be
formulated for use. Moreover, based on the fact that the
inventive modified polyolefin is excellent also in the
compatibility with other resins, other resins such as urethane
resin, epoxy resin, acrylic resin, phenol resin, alkyd resin,
silicone resin and nitrocellulose may be blended additionally
when using as a binder for paint or ink, if further needed.</p> <p num="0021">In following, the invention will be illustrated in more
detail based on examples, but the inventionis not confined
thereto.</p><heading>EXAMPLE</heading><heading>(Example-1)</heading><p num="0022">After 35g of ethylene-propylene-butene copolymer(propylene

modified polyolefin is maleic anhydride-modified product using no 
styrenic monomer, it is recognized that solution is turbidand
tack also becomes strong, because of unreacted maleic anhydride
remaining in the system, as known publicly. Conversely, in
Comparative example-2,wherein, styrenic monomer was used
approximately in equal quantity, the adherence and heat seal
strength decrease, because of increased styrene content.
Moreover, from Tables 2 and 3, it can be confirmed that the
adherence, weather resistance and oil resistance decrease
remarkably in Comparative example-2, wherein styrenic monomer
content was high. Similarly, in Table 4, decreased adherence is
seen in Comparative example-2.</p><p num="0041">As a result aforementioned, it is evident that, while the
effect of combined use of styrenic monomer at the time of maleic
anhydride modification is surely recognized as in publicly known
reports, in the case of the quantity of styrenic monomer being
high as reported conventionally, various physical properties such
as adherence, weather resistance and oil resistance end up to
decrease in the uses at which the invention aims, hence balanced
excellent physical properties can be achieved only at the limited
use level that was found according to the invention.</p><p num="0042">As described, it can be said that the inventive technique
