salts thereof, wherein B ring is bonded to A ring via -X- and A ring
is directly bonded to the glucose residue, and it is usable as a
Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, especially for a therapeutic
and/or preventive agent for diabetes such as insulin-dependent
diabetes (type 1 diabetes) and insulin-independent diabetes (type 2
diabetes), as well as diabetes related diseases such as an
insulin-resistant diseases and obesity.</p></abstract><description lang="EN" load-source="ep" status="new"><heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0001">The present invention relates to C-glycoside derivatives and
salts thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to
C-glycoside derivatives and salts thereof useful as a Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose
cotransporter inhibitor. C-glycoside derivatives and salts thereof
of the present invention are useful for treatment of various
diabetes-related diseases inclusive of insulin-dependent diabetes
(type 1 diabetes), insulin-independent diabetes (type 2 diabetes),
insulin-resistant diseases and obesity, and the prevention of these
diseases.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0002">In recent years, a medicine to inhibit glucose-reabsorption
by Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporters (SGLT) in the intestinal tract and
kidney (a Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter inhibitor) has been demanded
as an antidiabetic agent to rapidly normalize hyperglycemia and
improve the energy balance in the body. Such a Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose
cotransporter inhibitor has been expected as an excellent agent for
treating or preventing various diabetes-related diseases such as
insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1 diabetes) and insulin-independent
diabetes (type 2 diabetes), as well as insulin-resistant
diseases and obesity.</p><p num="0003">As compounds used for the Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter 
inhibitor, phloridzin described in Welch, C.A. et al. (J. Natr., 1989,
119(11) 1698) and synthetic O-glycoside derivatives described in
Hongu, M. et al. (Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1998, 46(1) 22) and
JP-A-11-21243 are known, for example. These compounds are
reported to discharge excess blood glucose into urine and reduce
blood glucose level by inhibiting glucose-reabsorption by
Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporters in the intestinal tract or in the kidney.</p><p num="0004">However, because any of these compounds is an O-glycoside
derivative comprising an O-glucoside bond formed between glucose
and an aglycon moiety, it has a problem that the inhibition effect is
reduced due to hydrolysis of O-glucoside bond by glucosidase or the
like in the small intestine when orally absorbed.</p><p num="0005">In addition, in the case of phloridin, phloretin, which is an
aglycon moiety of phloridin, is known as a strong inhibitor for a
facilitated diffusion-type glucose transporter. For example, it is
reported that the cerebral glucose concentration decreases when
phloretin is administered to the vein of a rat (e.g. Stroke, 1983, 14,
388). Phloretin is also known as an inhibitor of a vitamin C
transporter (Wang, Y. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 2000,
267, 488-494).</p><p num="0006">Therefore, an attempt has been made to use a C-glycoside
prepared by converting oxygen in the glucoside bond of the
O-glycoside to carbon as the Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter inhibitor.</p><p num="0007">For example, JP-A-2001-288178 (Patent Document 1)
describes that compounds of the following formula are effective in
inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporters and are useful as a treating
agent or preventing agent for diabetes and a hypoglycemic agent. <img file="00030001.tif" id="img-00030001" he="56" wi="87" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" orientation="unknown" inline="no"/>

2) describes that a compound of the following formula can be used
as the Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter inhibitor to treat obesity or type 2
diabetes.

further details on the symbols of the above formula).</p><p num="0009">As explained above, the C-glycoside derivatives are useful to
a certain extent for treating diabetes due to the effect of inhibiting
a Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter. However, due to the recent rise in
incidence of diabetes which is a lifestyle-related disease and could
even be called one of the most popular diseases in Japan,
compounds having a chemical structure different from that of
known compounds and showing the effect of inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose
cotransporters more rapidly and more significantly have been
increasingly desired for the clinical practice of diabetes treatment
or the like.</p><heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0010">The present inventors have found that C-glycoside

The
test compound was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose solution to a
concentration of 1 mg/10 ml. The weight of each mouse was
measured. The test compound suspension was orally administered
to the mice at a dose of 10 ml/kg. Only 0. 5% methylcellulose
solution was administered to the mice of a control group. Each
group consisted of six mice. Blood was collected from the tail vein
immediately before administering the compound and one, two, four,
and eight hours after administering the compound. The blood
glucose value was measured using a glucose CII Test Wako
(manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). The
intensity of hypoglycemic activity was determined by calculating
the area under the blood glucose value-time curve (AUC) using a
trapezoidal method from the glucose value of 0-8 hours after
administering the compound and calculating the rate (%) of the
decrease in the AUC of the drug-administered group from that of
the control group.</p><p num="0182">As a result, the compound of the present invention exhibited
a strong hypoglycemic activity. The hypoglycemic activity of
typical compounds of the present invention are shown in Table 41.

As a result of Test Examples 1 and 2, compounds of the present
invention showed a remarkable effect by inhibiting a Na<sup>+-</sup>glucose
cotransporter activity and a strong hypoglycemic activity.
Therefore, it is expected that compounds of the present invention
can serve as an antidiabetic medicine having the same or higher
effect in comparison with the conventional antidiabetic medicines.</p><p num="0183">The pharmaceutical composition containing one or more of
the compounds of the present invention and the pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof is prepared as a tablet, powder, fine

in the range of 0.1-500 mg per day for oral administration or in the
range of 0.01-100 mg per day for parenteral administration, once or
several times a day. Since the amount to be administered varies,
depending upon various conditions, it may be sufficient to
administer the compound at a smaller amount than the
above-described amount.</p><p num="0185">As a solid composition for oral administration of the

suspension include distilled water and a physiological saline
solution for injection. Examples of the diluent for the nonaqueous
solution or suspension include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,
and vegetable oils such as olive oil; alcohols such as ethyl alcohol;

These compounds are sterilized by filtering through a
bacteria-retaining filter and adding a disinfectant or irradiating,
for example. These compounds may be used by producing a
sterilized solid composition and dissolving the composition in a
sterilized water or injection solvent before using. <img file="00870001.tif" id="img-00870001" he="197" wi="164" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" orientation="unknown" inline="no"/><img
