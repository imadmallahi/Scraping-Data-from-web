<title>Respiratory tract disorders treatment using inhalation of porous particles containing hydrophobic amino acid and endogenous phspholipids.</title>
<narrative>

Find patents that claim use of porous inhalation particles that contain a hydrophobic amino acid (e.g. leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, etc.) and endogenous phospholipid(s) (e.g. phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, etc.) for treatment of respiratory tract disorders.
