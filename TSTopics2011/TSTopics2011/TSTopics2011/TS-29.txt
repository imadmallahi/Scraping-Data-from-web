A document will be considered RELEVANT if it refers to Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and their use as treatment of Alzheimer's disease

A document will be considered HIGHLY RELEVANT if, in addition to being relevant, it also contains the minimum inhibitory concentration data (MIC data) generally present in the form of tables in documents. Such values are generally expressed as IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) or Ki (inhibition constant for a drug) values.
