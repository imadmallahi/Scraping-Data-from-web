<title>DNA-based asymmetric catalysis</title>
<narrative>
The users are looking for information about DNA-based asymmetric catalysis, especially sample reactions that have been done so far. The novel concept of DNA-based asymmetric catalysis was introduced only five years ago, thus there would not be too many results, most of which are enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions.

A document will be considered RELEVANT if it describes DNA-based asymmetric catalysis reactions. Such reactions are also called DNA-based chiral catalysis.

A document will be considered HIGHLY RELEVANT if it is RELEVANT and describes reactions that are DNA-based asymmetric catalysis but ARE NOT enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions.
