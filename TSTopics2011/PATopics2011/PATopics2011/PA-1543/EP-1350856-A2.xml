reduced iron using blast-furnace sludge.</p><p num="0002">Blast-furnace dust can be classified into relatively
coarse dry dust collected by a dry system and sludge
consisting of fine particles collected by a wet system. Dry
dust has a relatively low zinc content when compared with
that of sludge, and can be recycled as the material for
sintered ore. In contrast, sludge having a high zinc
content requires zinc-removing processes before being
recycled as a blast-furnace feed material.</p><p num="0003">Recently, various methods for processing dust have been
investigated. As a result of the investigation, a rotary
hearth furnace method including the steps of agglomerating a
mixture of an iron-oxide-containing substance, such as iron
ore or dust, and a carbonaceous reductant and heating the
resulting agglomerates in a rotary hearth furnace so as to
obtain reduced iron has been put to practical application.
According to this method, dust containing iron oxides can be
reduced and can be effectively recycled as an iron source
while achieving high production efficiency and low equipment 
cost.</p><p num="0004">In a rotary hearth furnace method, green pellets
containing water are dried before they are fed to a rotary
hearth furnace. The drying is necessary to prevent the
pellets from bursting due to sudden evaporation during
heating, i.e., to prevent "bursting" inside the furnace.</p><p num="0005">According to a known technique, when pellets made from
a mixture of iron ore as the iron-oxide material and a
carbonaceous material such as coal are used, the pellets are
dried to reduce the water content thereof to 1 percent by
mass or less. With this technique, bursting of the pellets
inside the furnace can be prevented and handling strength,
i.e., shattering strength, crushing strength, or the like,
that can sufficiently withstand the feeding operation
described above can be obtained.</p><p num="0006">However, when pellets contain blast-furnace sludge, the
pellets break into chips and fines when they are fed inside
the rotary hearth furnace even though they are dried to a
water content of 1 percent by mass or less. As a result, a
significant degree of pulverization occurs, and handling of
the resulting reduced iron product becomes extremely
difficult. This results in a decrease in metallization
degree of the resulting reduced iron product, a decrease in
zinc-removal rate, and a decrease in yield. Furthermore, a
large amount of iron oxide becomes mixed in the recovered 
crude zinc oxide, thereby degrading the quality as the zinc
oxide material.</p><p num="0007">Another known method for making reduced iron includes
the steps of dehydrating a mixture containing undried blast-furnace
sludge and so on by squeezing, extruding the
resulting dehydrated mixture to form compacts, and feeding
the compacts into a rotary hearth furnace without drying the
compacts so as to perform drying, heating, and reducing of
the compacts. According to this method, the degree of
dehydration and the degree of powder filling are adjusted to
prevent the compacts from bursting inside the furnace.
However, since blast-furnace sludge expands during reduction
as described below, breaking of the compacts cannot be
effectively prevented by merely avoiding bursting resulting
from water evaporation. Moreover, since the compacts are
dried on the rotary hearth before reduction, the compacts
remain in the furnace for a long time, thereby requiring a
large hearth and a large-scale reduction plant.</p><p num="0008">The present invention aims to overcome the above-described
problems. An object of the present invention is
to provide a method for making reduced iron whereby breaking
of agglomerates containing blast-furnace sludge into pieces
and/or fines is avoided inside the furnace, reduced iron 
products of high metallization degrees can be produced at
high yield, and high-grade zinc material, i.e., crude zinc
oxide, can be recovered during the course.</p><p num="0009">An aspect of the present invention provides a method
for making reduced iron using blast-furnace sludge,
comprising a mixing step of mixing the blast-furnace sludge
with an iron-oxide-containing powder and/or a carbonaceous
powder to prepare a mixed material; an agglomerating step of
agglomerating the mixed material to form agglomerates; a
feeding step of feeding the agglomerates onto a continuously
moving hearth; and a reducing step of heating the
agglomerates to remove zinc as well as to reduce the
agglomerates.</p><p num="0010">Preferably, the mixed material has an excess carbon

agglomerates containing blast-furnace sludge inside the
furnace, the present inventors have examined the
microstructure of blast-furnace sludge and the
microstructure of blast-furnace-sludge-containing pellets
after reduction. As a result of the examination, the cause
of breaking was found to be as follows.</p><p num="0022">Blast-furnace sludge consists of fine dust in top gas
of a blast furnace collected by a wet dust collector and
thus has a high water content. Blast-furnace sludge is
dehydrated and dried in a rotary dryer, a fluidized-bed 
dryer, or the like to enhance transfer convenience. However,
since excessively dried blast-furnace sludge generates dust
during transfer, i.e., particularly during transfer by an
open-air dump truck, the water content thereof is generally
controlled to approximately 10 to 30 percent by mass.</p><p num="0023">Moreover, blast-furnace sludge contains a large amount
of, i.e., generally 20 to 40 mass percent of, carbon in
addition to iron oxides and zinc oxide. Accordingly, when
the blast-furnace sludge alone is agglomerated and reduced
by heating, a large amount of carbon remains even after
reduction of iron oxides and zinc oxide.</p><p num="0024">As described above, the blast-furnace sludge is half
dried so that some amount of water remains in the blast-furnace
sludge. Generally, a fine substance cannot be
uniformly dried. A large number of portions having a high
water content remain in the half-dried fine substance, and
these portions form pseudoparticles as they are agitated in
a dryer. Pseudoparticles consisting of fine particles are
remarkably hard and are not easily crushed by such an impact
as that imposed during agitation in a mixer during a mixing
step.</p><p num="0025">Powder that was contained in reduced iron products was
observed with a microscope. According to the observation,
metallic iron produced by reduction was whisker-shaped.
Pellet samples composed of only blast-furnace sludge were 
separately prepared and reduced by heating in a small
furnace. The reduced pellet samples were then observed with
a microscope. According to the observation, the metallic
iron whiskers similar to those described above were found.
This demonstrates that the blast-furnace sludge greatly
expanded during reduction because the blast-furnace sludge
consisting of finer particles allowed a rapid reduction and
permitted metallic iron whiskers to readily grow.</p><p num="0026">Accordingly, when pellets containing a large number of
pseudoparticles are heated in a rotary hearth furnace, the
pseudoparticles consisting of only blast-furnace sludge
significantly expand during reduction while the portions
having a less amount of blast-furnace sludge do not expand
as much as the pseudoparticles. As a result, stress
concentration occurs around the surfaces of the
pseudoparticles, thereby generating cracks, which develop
into pellet breaking and pellet pulverization.</p><p num="0027">Moreover, since agglomerates are heated with burners
inside the rotary hearth furnace, the oxidizing components
such as CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in combustion gas of the burners partly
consumes carbon in the agglomerates due to a solution-loss
reaction, thereby reoxidizing the reduced metallic iron. In
order to obtain sufficiently high zinc-removal rate and
metallization degree, carbon is added to the agglomerates at
an amount exceeding the amount of carbon theoretically 
required to completely reduce zinc oxide and iron oxides.
However, when the amount of carbon is too large, carbon
remains in the agglomerates even after completion of
metallization, and the carbon particles as well as generated
metallic iron whiskers inhibit metallic iron from sintering,
thereby causing breaking of the agglomerates.</p><p num="0028">In view of the above, the present invention prevents
agglomerates from breaking by reducing the number of
pseudoparticles, which would cause stress concentration, as
much as possible prior to agglomeration, and by limiting the
amount of carbon contained in the agglomerates or by
limiting the amount of blast-furnace sludge, which generates
metallic iron whiskers, contained in the agglomerates.</p><p num="0029">The present invention will now be described in terms of
preferred embodiments.</p><heading>First Embodiment</heading><p num="0030">Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a plant by which
a method of the present invention for making reduced iron (a
method for making crude zinc oxide) using blast-furnace
sludge is implemented.</p><p num="0031">As has been previously described, since blast-furnace
sludge having a high water content may contain a large
number of pseudoparticles, the blast-furnace sludge is
preferably disintegrated in advance. Referring to Fig. 1, 
blast-furnace sludge A containing pseudoparticles having a
diameter exceeding 1 mm is disintegrated using a
disintegrator 1 so that the ratio of the pseudoparticles to
the mixed material prepared as below becomes 50 percent by
mass or less (disintegrating step). Examples of the
disintegrator 1 include a rod mill, a ball mill, and a jaw
crusher.</p><p num="0032">An iron-oxide-containing powder B1 containing iron
oxides is added to the disintegrated blast-furnace sludge A.
Examples of the iron-oxide-containing powder B1 include iron
ore powder, and steel mill wastes such as basic-oxygen-furnace
dust, electric-furnace dust, mill scale, and mill
sludge. Water may be added if necessary. A binder such as
starch or bentonite may also be added. The amount of the
additive iron-oxide-containing powder B1 is adjusted to
satisfy the relationship (1):
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">Sc ≤ 8 - 2NL</st32:df>
wherein Sc = XC - (12/16)·XO, NL represents an average
number of layers of agglomerates, e.g., pellets, placed on
the hearth, XC represents the mass ratio (mass percent) of
carbon in the agglomerates in a dry state, and XO represents
the total mass ratio (mass percent) of oxygen in iron oxides
and oxygen in zinc oxide in the dry agglomerates.</p><p num="0033">In relationship (1), Sc represents an excess carbon
ratio. The excess carbon ratio indicates the amount of 
carbon that exceeds the amount of carbon theoretically
required to completely reduce zinc oxide and iron oxides to
metallic zinc and metallic iron, respectively. The average
number NL of layers refers to the thickness of the layer of
agglomerates (pellets) divided by the average diameter of
the agglomerates (pellets). The thickness of the layer is
determined based on the assumption that the agglomerates are
tightly and closely bedded on the hearth with no space
therebetween. When the agglomerates are not spherical, e.g.,
when the agglomerates are briquettes and not pellets, this
closely bedded state is when the agglomerates are placed on
the hearth at their most stable position, i.e., placed in
such a manner that the thickness direction of the
agglomerates coincides with the thickness direction of the
layer. Here, NL = 1 when the agglomerates placed in this
manner are closely bedded in a single layer. Accordingly,
relationship (1) shows that the upper limit of the excess
carbon ratio SC changes according to the average number NL
of the agglomerate (pellet) layers.</p><p num="0034">It should be noted here that an excessively small
excess carbon ratio Sc results in insufficient zinc-removal
and insufficient metallization of the pellets. Since
metallization of iron is more difficult than zinc removal,
the excess carbon ratio Sc should be at least -1, preferably
at least 0, and most preferably at least 1 when high 
metallization degree is required. The materials prepared as
above are mixed in a mixer 2 to obtain a mixed material
(mixing step). An example of the mixer 2 is a drum mixer.</p><p num="0035">The mixed material is agglomerated into green pellets
with an agglomerator such as a pan pelletizer or a drum
pelletizer (agglomerating step).</p><p num="0036">The green pellets are dried to reduce the water content
to 1 percent by mass or less by a dryer 4 such as a grate
dryer so as to prepare dry pellets (agglomerates-drying
step). Since pseudoparticles of blast furnace sludge are
disintegrated to a certain extent before they are
agglomerated, the time taken for drying the pellets is
shortened.</p><p num="0037">The dry pellets are placed on a horizontally rotating
hearth (not shown) of a rotary hearth furnace 6 using a
feeder 5 (feeding step). The average number of the dry
pellet layers is controlled to a predetermined value. Since
the layers of pellets on the hearth are heated by radiation
from the burners above, the temperatures of the layers are
gradually increased from the top to the bottom. Accordingly,
when the average number of pellet layers is large, the
pellets at the bottom layer are not sufficiently heated,
resulting in incomplete zinc-removal and incomplete
metallization. In other words, the higher the production of
the reduced iron, the lower the quality of the reduced iron 
products, and vice versa. From this point of view, the
average number of the pellet layers is preferably 2 or less.
As is apparent from relationship (1), the smaller the
average number of the pellet layers, the higher the upper
limit of the excess carbon ratio. Here, the term "upper
limit of the excess carbon ratio" refers to the maximum
excess carbon ratio that can prevent pellets from breaking.
In other words, when the average number of the pellet layers
is small, the pellets can contain a large amount of blast
furnace sludge having a high carbon content without
suffering from breaking, thereby increasing the processing
amount of blast-furnace sludge. Thus, the average number of
the pellet layers is preferably 1 or less.</p><p num="0038">The upper limit of the excess carbon ratio rises as the
average number of the pellet layers decreases. This is
because the pellet layers can be rapidly heated to the
bottom and the reduction of the pellet layers as a whole can
be rapidly completed to obtain enough time for metallic iron
to sinter. Accordingly, the resulting pellets, i.e., the
reduced iron, as a whole can exhibit increased strength.
However, when the average number of pellets is excessively
small, the area of the hearth not effectively used for
pellet reduction increases, resulting in a decrease in
production efficiency of the rotary hearth furnace. Thus,
the average number of pellet layers is preferably 0.5 or 
more.</p><p num="0039">As the pellets travel through the rotary hearth furnace
6 by the rotation of the hearth, they are heated with
burners 7 installed above the hearth to completely remove
water remaining in the pellets. When the pellets are heated
to a temperature of 1,200°C or more, reduction begins
(reducing step). During the reduction, blast furnace sludge
may expand, but since the excess carbon ratio is controlled
to satisfy relationship (1), pellets are prevented from
breaking.</p><p num="0040">The reduction proceeds while zinc oxide and iron oxides
are in close contact with carbon inside the pellets. As a
result, reduced iron products having high zinc-removal ratio
and high metallization degree can be produced at high yield.</p><p num="0041">Zinc oxide in the furnace exhaust gas is recovered by a
dust collector 8 after the gas is cooled (zinc-recovering
step). An example of the dust collector is a bag filter.
Since pellets are prevented from breaking inside the furnace,
recovered zinc oxide has a low concentration of contaminants
such as iron. Thus, high-quality crude zinc oxide, which is
a valuable feed material for producing metallic zinc, can be
recovered.</p><heading>Second Embodiment</heading><p num="0042">A second embodiment of the present invention will now 
be described with reference to Fig. 2. In the mixing step
of the first embodiment described above, a carbonaceous
powder B2 containing carbon may be added instead of or in
addition to the iron-oxide-containing powder B1. Here, the
mixture of the iron-oxide-containing powder B1 and the
carbonaceous powder B2, and the carbonaceous powder B2 alone
are collectively referred to as a powder material B
containing either carbon or carbon and iron oxide. Examples
of the carbonaceous powder B2 include coal powder, coke
powder, petroleum coke powder, coke dry quencher (CDQ)
powder, charcoal powder, carbide powder of wastes, and
blast-furnace dry dust. The amount of the powder material B
added is adjusted to satisfy relationship (2):
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">Sc ≤ 8 - 2NL + 0.02YD</st32:df>
wherein Sc = XC - (12/16)·XO, NL represents the average
number of the agglomerate (pellet) layers on the hearth, YD
= 100XC<sub>B</sub>/XC, XC is a carbon content (percent by mass) in the
dried agglomerates, XO is a total content (percent by mass)
of oxygen in iron oxides and oxygen in zinc oxide, and XC<sub>B</sub> is
a carbon content (percent by mass) in the powder material B
in the dried agglomerates.</p><p num="0043">In relationship (2), YD represents the carbon
substitution ratio. The carbon substitution ratio indicates
the extent of which carbon in the blast-furnace sludge is
substituted by carbon in the powder material B. In 
particular, the carbon substitution ratio YD = amount of
carbon in the powder material B in the dried
agglomerates/total amount of carbon in the dried
agglomerates × 100. Here, only fixed carbon is considered
as a substitutable carbon in the carbonaceous powder B2.

For example, when a mixed material contains 21% of blast-furnace
sludge having a carbon content of 36.6%, 14% of coal
having a fixed carbon content of 71%, and 65% of basic-oxygen-furnace
dust having a carbon content of 1%, the
carbon substitution ratio YD is calculated as follows:
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">YD = (14 × 71 + 65 × 1)/(21 x 36.6 + 14 × 71 + 65 × 1) × 100
= 57.9%</st32:df>
Accordingly, relationship (2) shows that the upper limit of
the excess carbon ratio Sc changes depending not only on the
average number NL of the pellet layers but also on the
carbon substitution ratio YD.</p><p num="0044">The agglomerating step, the feeding step, and the
reducing step are then performed as in the first embodiment.
Relationship (2) shows that, during the reduction, the upper
limit of the excess carbon ratio, which is the maximum ratio
that can prevent pellets from breaking during the reduction,
can be increased by increasing the carbon substitution ratio
YD. In other words, pellets are prevented from breaking
without excessively reducing the average number of pellet
layers and without decreasing the excess carbon ratio.
 
Accordingly, both high productive efficiency and high pellet
quality can be achieved.</p><p num="0045">The upper limit of the excess carbon ratio Sc, which is
the maximum ratio that can prevent pellets from breaking,
increases as the carbon substitution ratio YD increases.
This is because the powder material that replaced the blast-furnace
sludge is coarser than blast-furnace sludge. As a
result, the reduction reaction becomes slow and metallic
iron whiskers are rarely produced. Moreover, whereas carbon
in the blast-furnace sludge is completely homogeneously
mixed with iron oxides and the like and thus undergoes a
rapid reduction reaction, carbon in the powder material is
not completely homogeneously mixed with iron oxides and the
like even after the mixing step. Thus, the reduction
reaction becomes slow, and metallic iron whiskers are rarely
produced.</p><heading>Third Embodiment</heading><p num="0046">Referring to Fig. 1, blast-furnace sludge A containing
pseudoparticles having a diameter exceeding 1 mm is
disintegrated using a disintegrator 1 until the ratio of the
pseudoparticles having a diameter exceeding 1 mm to the
mixed material is 50 percent by mass or less (disintegrating
step). Examples of the disintegrator include crushers and
grinders such as a roll mill, a rod mill, a ball mill, and a 
jaw crusher. A powder material B containing iron oxides is
blended into the disintegrated blast-furnace sludge A.
Examples of the powder material B include steel mill wastes
such as iron ore powder, basic-oxygen-furnace dust,
electric-furnace dust, mill scale, and mill sludge. Water
may also be added if necessary. Furthermore, a carbonaceous
substance such as coal, coke, petroleum coke, or the like,
or a binder such as starch, bentonite, or the like may be
added. The resulting mixture is mixed in a mixer 2 so as to
prepare a mixed material (mixing step). Examples of the
mixer 2 include a drum mixer and a paddle mixer. The mixed
material is then agglomerated into green pellets using a
known agglomerator 3 (agglomerating step). Examples of the
agglomerator 3 include a pan pelletizer and a drum
pelletizer. The green pellets are dried using a dryer 4
until the water content thereof is 1 percent by mass or less
so as to prepare dry pellets (drying step). An example of
the dryer 4 is a grate dryer. Since pseudoparticles
contained in the blast-furnace sludge are disintegrated in
advance to some extent before agglomeration, the time taken
for drying is short. The dry pellets are placed on a
horizontally rotating hearth (not shown) of a rotary hearth
furnace 6 in one to two layers. The pellets are heated by
radiation from burners 7 installed above the hearth as the
pellets travel through the rotary hearth furnace 6 (reducing 
step). This heating is required to completely remove water
remaining in the pellets and to increase the temperature of
the pellets to approximately at least 1,200°C so as to start
reduction. Since the ratio of the pseudoparticles having a
diameter exceeding 1 mm in the pellets is controlled in a
predetermined range, the pellets are prevented from breaking
even when blast-furnace sludge containing pseudoparticles
expands during the reduction. Accordingly, the reduction
reaction proceeds while carbon, zinc oxide, and iron oxides
in the pellets are in close contact with each other. As a
result, reduced iron products having high zinc-removal rate
and metallization degree can be obtained at high yield.</p><p num="0047">Zinc oxide in the furnace exhaust gas is recovered by a
dust collector 8 after the gas is cooled (zinc-recovering
step). An example of the dust collector is a bag filter.
Since pellets are prevented from generating fines due to
pellet disruption during the reduction inside the furnace,
recovered zinc oxide has a low concentration of contaminants
such as iron. Thus, high quality crude zinc oxide, which is
a valuable feed material for producing metallic zinc, can be
recovered.</p><p num="0048">The pseudoparticles in the mixed material are
preferably disintegrated in a manner that satisfies
relationship (3) that shows the relationship between the
mass ratio XQ (unit: percent by mass) of the pseudoparticles 
having a diameter exceeding 1 mm and the excess carbon ratio
Sc (unit: percent by mass):

   when
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">0 ≤ Sc ≤ 2, XQ ≤ 50;</st32:df>
and

   when
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">2 &lt; Sc ≤ 6, XQ ≤ 70 - 10·Sc</st32:df>
wherein Sc = XC - (12/16)·XO, XC is a mass ratio (percent by
mass) of carbon in the dried agglomerates, and XO is a total
mass ratio (percent by mass) of oxygen in iron oxides and
oxygen in zinc oxide in the dried agglomerates.</p><p num="0049">As shown above, the higher the excess carbon ratio Sc,
the larger the amount of carbon that exceeds the amount
theoretically required to completely reduce zinc oxide and
iron oxides. Since pellets are heated in the rotary hearth
furnace 6 using burners, oxidizing components, such as CO<sub>2</sub>
and H<sub>2</sub>O, in the combustion gas of the burners partly consume
carbon of the pellets by a solution-loss reaction, thereby
reoxidizing the reduced metallic iron. Thus, an adequate
amount of excess carbon is required to achieve sufficiently
high metallization degree. High zinc-removal rate and high
metallization degree can be achieved by increasing the
amount of excess carbon, i.e., the excess carbon ratio Sc.
However, carbon inhibits sintering of metallic iron and thus
causes pellets to break into pieces when the amount of the
carbon in the pellets is increased. To prevent breaking
into pieces, the mass ratio XQ of the pseudoparticles having
a diameter exceeding 1 mm is decreased as the excess carbon 
ratio Sc is increased.</p><p num="0050">Note that when 0 ≤ Sc ≤ 2, decreasing the mass ratio XQ
of the pseudoparticles having a diameter exceeding 1 mm is
not necessary even when the excess carbon ratio Sc is
increased. This is because, at an excess carbon ratio Sc
within this range, carbon rarely remains in the metallic
iron because of the solution-loss reaction described above
and thus does not inhibit sintering of the metallic iron.
When Sc &gt; 6, the amount of carbon remaining in the reduced
iron becomes excessively large, and sintering of metallic
iron is significantly inhibited. Within this range,
breaking of the pellets cannot sufficiently be prevented
even when the pseudoparticles having a diameter exceeding 1
mm are completely disintegrated.</p><p num="0051">More preferably, the mass ratio XQ of the
pseudoparticles having a diameter exceeding 1 mm is further
limited to satisfy relationship (4) below so as to reliably
prevent the reduced pellets from breaking:

use pellets as agglomerates, agglomerates are not limited to
pellets. Agglomerates may be briquettes, tabular compacts,
columnar compacts, or the like. Moreover, the means for
agglomeration is not limited to the pelletizer. The means 
for agglomeration may be a briquetter, a compactor, or an
extruder. In making briquettes, the blast-furnace sludge
may be dried in advance to a predetermined water content so
as to prepare a mixed material having a water content of 1
percent by mass or less, and the mixed material may be
directly press-formed into briquettes without drying. This
is possible because making of briquettes does not require
the mixed material to have a high water content. In this
manner, the drying step between the agglomeration step and
the feeding step can be omitted.</p><heading>Example 1</heading><p num="0053">An experiment was conducted using blast-furnace sludge
and basic-oxygen-furnace dust having the compositions shown
in Table 1. The water content of the blast-furnace sludge
was 14 percent by mass. Mixtures were prepared by blending
the blast-furnace sludge and the basic-oxygen-furnace dust
at different ratios. Each mixture was mixed in a ribbon
mixer for 2 minutes while adding water to prepare a mixed
material. The mixed material was agglomerated into green
pellets having a diameter of approximately 14 mm using a pan
pelletizer having a diameter of 1 m. The water content of
the green pellets was 13 to 14 percent by mass. The green
pellets were dried with a small dryer to reduce the water
content to 1 percent by mass or less so as to prepare dry 
pellets. The dry pellets were placed in two layers in a
small furnace maintained at 1,230°C for 20 to 25 minutes to
obtain reduced iron. The crushing strength of the reduced
iron in the upper layer and that in the lower layer were
measured. During the reduction, a gas having CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> = 20
percent by volume/80 percent by volume was charged into the
small furnace so as to simulate the actual atmosphere of a
furnace equipped with burners.</p><p num="0054">The experimental results are shown in Figs. 3A and 3B.
Fig. 3A is a graph showing the relationship between the
excess carbon ratio Sc of the pellets in the upper layer and
the crushing strength of the reduced iron. Fig. 3B is a
graph showing the relationship between the excess carbon
ratio Sc of the pellets in the lower layer and the crushing
strength of the reduced iron. As shown in Figs. 3A and 3B,
the crushing strength of the reduced iron substantially
linearly decreased as the excess carbon ratio Sc was
increased.</p><p num="0055">An investigation had been made as to the relationship
between the breaking of the reduced iron and the crushing
strength in actual operations. It was found that the
crushing strength of the reduced iron must be at least 15
kg/p in order to prevent breaking of the pellets during the
reduction step. Accordingly, from the results shown in Figs.
3A and 3B, it can be concluded that in order to prevent 
pellets from breaking during the reduction when the average
number NL of pellet layers is 2, the excess carbon ratio Sc
must be 4 percent by mass or less to allow the pellets at
the lower layer to achieve the crushing strength of 15 kg/p.
When the average number NL of the pellet layers is 1, only
the results regarding the pellets in the upper layer, i.e.,
the results shown in Fig. 3A, need to be considered. In
particular, the excess carbon ratio should be 6 percent by
mass or less in order to prevent pellets from breaking
during the reduction. The experimental results above derive
relationship (1) described above. In the experiment, a high
zinc removal rate of 95% or more and a high metallization of
80% or more were achieved when the range of the excess
carbon ratio was Sc ≥ - 0.3. <tables><table><tgroup cols="8"><tbody><row><entry nameend="8" align="left" namest="1">            (mass % on a dry basis)</entry></row><row><entry align="center"/><entry align="center">T.
