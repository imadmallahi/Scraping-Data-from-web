compounds that bind to opiate receptors (e.g. mu, kappa and delta opioid
receptors).</p><p num="0002">Compounds that bind to such receptors are likely to be useful in the
treatment of diseases mediated by opiate receptors, for example irritable
bowel syndrome; constipation; nausea; vomiting; and pruritic dermatoses,
such as allergic dermatitis and atopy in animals and humans. Compounds
that bind to opiate receptors have also been indicated in the treatment of
eating disorders, opiate overdoses, depression, smoking and alcohol
addiction, sexual dysfunction, shock, stroke, spinal damage and head
trauma.</p><p num="0003">There is a particular need for an improved treatment of itching. Itching,
or pruritus, is a common dermatological symptom that can give rise to
considerable distress in both humans and animals. Pruritus is often
associated with inflammatory skin diseases which may be caused by
hypersensitivity reactions, including reactions to insect bites, such as flea
bites, and to environmental allergens, such as house dust mite or pollen;
by bacterial and fungal infections of the skin; or by ectoparasite infections.</p><p num="0004">Existing treatments that have been employed in the treatment of pruritus
include the use of corticosteroids and antihistamines. However, both of
these treatments are known to have undesirable side effects. Other
therapies that have been employed include the use of essential fatty acid
dietary supplements, though these have the disadvantages of being slow to 
act, and of offering only limited efficacy against allergic dermatitis. A
variety of emollients such as soft paraffin, glycerine and lanolin are also
employed, but with limited success.</p><p num="0005">Thus, there is a continuing need for alternative and/or improved
treatments of pruritus.</p><p num="0006">Certain 4-arylpiperidine-based compounds are disclosed in <i>inter alia</i>
European patent applications EP 287339, EP 506468, EP 506478 and J.

be performed at a different stage in the overall route (i.e. substituents may

particular reaction). This will depend <i>inter alia</i> on factors such as the
nature of other functional groups present in a particular substrate, the
availability of key intermediates and the protecting group strategy (if any)
to be adopted. Clearly, the type of chemistry involved will influence the 
choice of reagent that is used in the said synthetic steps, the need, and
type, of protecting groups that are employed, and the sequence for
accomplishing the synthesis. The procedures may be adapted as appropriate
to the reactants, reagents and other reaction parameters in a manner that will
be evident to the skilled person by reference to standard textbooks and to the
examples provided hereinafter.</p><p num="0061">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain protected

deprotection stage, may not possess pharmacological activity as such, but
may, in certain instances, be administered orally or parenterally and
thereafter metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention

described in 'Design of Prodrugs' by H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, <b>1985</b> (the
disclosure in which document is hereby incorporated by reference), may be
placed on appropriate functionalities, when such functionalities are present
within compounds of formula I. For example, biolabile groups may be
placed on functional groups of compounds of formula I (e.g. an NH
functionality in a Het<sup>1</sup> group), and in the case of 5- or 6-membered Het<sup>1</sup>

manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with the
appropriate acid, either neat or in a suitable solvent, and the resulting salt
may then be isolated either by filtration of by evaporation under vacuum
of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts
can be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of a
compound of formula I with the appropriate base. Both types of salt may
be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.</p><p num="0065">The above procedures may be adapted as appropriate to the particular

Preferably the range is 0.1 to 10 mg per kg.</p><p num="0077">The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each
dosage containing from about 1 to about 500 mg, more usually about 5 to

refers to physically discreet units suitable as unitary dosages for human
subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined
quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic
effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.</p><p num="0078">In any event, the veterinary practitioner, or the skilled person, will be able
to determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an
