and to pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.</p><p num="0002">The compounds of formula I and their salts are characterized by valuable therapeutic
properties. It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention are
antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor. Substance P is a naturally
occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being
so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle
tissue. The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled
receptors.</p><p num="0003">The neuropeptide receptor for substance P (NK-1) is widely distributed throughout
the mammalian nervous system (especially brain and spinal ganglia), the circulatory
system and peripheral tissues (especially the duodenum and jejunum) and are involved in
regulating a number of diverse biological processes.

The central and peripheral actions of the mammalian tachykinin substance P have been
associated with numerous inflammatory conditions including migraine, rheumatoid
arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as mediation of the emetic reflex
and the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinson's disease
(Neurosci. Res., 1996, 7, 187-214), anxiety (Can. J. Phys., 1997, 75, 612-621) and
depression (Science, 1998, 281, 1640-1645).

Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially
migraine, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal,
cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and
other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut 
including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory
diseases reviewed in "Tachykinin Receptor and Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists", J.
Auton. Pharmacol., 13, 23-93, 1993.</p><p num="0004">Furthermore, Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists are being developed for the
treatment of a number of physiological disorders associated with an excess or imbalance of
tachykinin, in particular substance P. Examples of conditions in which substance P has
been implicated include disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety,
depression and psychosis (WO 95/16679, WO 95/18124 and WO 95/23798).</p><p num="0005">The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are further useful for the treatment of motion
sickness and for treatment induced vomiting.</p><p num="0006">In addition, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 3 190-195, 1999 has
been described the reduction of cisplatin-induced emesis by a selective neurokinin-1-receptor
antagonist.</p><p num="0007">Furthermore, US 5,972,938 describes a method for treating a psychoimmunologic or a
psychosomatic disorder by administration of a tachykinin receptor, such as NK-1 receptor
antagonist.</p><p num="0008">Objects of the present invention are the compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof, the preparation of the above-mentioned compounds,
medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above-mentioned
compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and
disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding
medicaments.</p><p num="0009">The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those,
which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or
prevention of certain depressive disorders or emesis by the administration of NK-1
receptor antagonists. A major depressive episode has been defined as being a period of at
least two weeks during which, for most of the day and nearly every day, there is either
depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all, or nearly all activities.</p><p num="0010">The following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply
irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination. As used
herein, the term "lower alkyl" denotes a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group
containing from 1-7 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl,
i-butyl, t-butyl and the like.

Preferred lower alkyl groups are groups with 1-4 carbon atoms. </p><p num="0011">The term "lower alkoxy" denotes a group wherein the alkyl residues are as defined

atoms.</p><p num="0014">The term "cyclic tertiary amine" denotes, for example, pyrrol-1-yl, imidazol-1-yl,
piperidin-1-yl, piperazin-1-yl, morpholin-4-yl, thiomorpholin-4-yl, 1-oxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl
or 1,1-dioxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl.</p><p num="0015">The term "5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group" denotes, for example pyridinyl,
pyrimidinyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, furyl, pyranyl, pyrrolyl,
imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isothiazolyl, piperazinyl or piperidyl.</p><p num="0016">The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with
inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid,
phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic
acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.</p><p num="0017">Exemplary preferred are compounds, in which X is -C(O)N(R<sup>5</sup>)-, wherein R<sup>5</sup> is
