components. A first resin component is a polycarbonate resin. A second resin blend
component is a first polyester copolymer resin derived from a cycloaliphatic diol or
equivalent thereof and a cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid or equivalent thereof. A

The three components are present in proportions to form a clear blend having a
transmission of seventy percent or greater and an elongation at break after exposure to
Fuel C of forty percent or greater. Desirable enhanced chemical resistance is provided
to the polycarbonate/polyester blend by the addition of the third component, which is

percent of a polycarbonate resin based on the total weight of the three blend
components. The second resin blend component, i.e. first polyester component, is

The third resin blend component, i.e. second polyester component, is present in an
amount from about 2 to about 35 weight percent based on the total weight of the

acid or equivalents and isophthalic acid or equivalents wherein the isophthalic acid is
present in said mixture in an amount for enhancing the clarity of the three component
blend.</p><p num="0011">According to an embodiment, desirable enhanced chemical resistance is provided with

said second polyester component.</p><p num="0012">According to an embodiment, a clear three component blend comprises a first

PCCD and PC are miscible and mixing results in transparent translucent blends,
having a single T<sub>g</sub> and excellent impact performance.</p><p num="0016">Surprisingly it was found that by using PCTA or PCTG as an additional polyester
polymer component to PCCD in the blend, the compositional design space can be
increased. PCTA is preferred for obtaining a large compositional design space in
which the favorable combination of high optical transparency and good chemical
resistance can be met. This is graphically shown in Figure 1, where the light colored
areas in the compositional areas indicate formulations that meet an optical
transparency of over 70% with a tensile elongation at break after exposure to Fuel C
of over 40%. The benefit of adding PCTA type polymers to PC/PCCD blends is that
the heat and chemical resistance are improved and the total raw material cost of the
formulation can be reduced.</p><p num="0017">In an embodiment, the transparent ternary blend includes PC, PCCD, and a 1)
cycloaliphatic polyester containing the condensation product of 1,4-cyclohexanedimentanol

cycloaliphatic polyester containing the condensation product of 1,4-cyclohexanedimentanol,
ethylene glycol, and a terephthalic acid, divalent residues or
derivatives thereof. Preferably the third component of the above ternary blend is
PCTA which comprises the reaction product of CHDM, TPA and IPA. The third
component may be PCTG type as set forth in 2). In this case CHDM and DMCD
condensation reactants and equivalents thereof may include polyol components such
as divalent aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic radical diols, or diol derivatives, or
mixtures of such diols and derivatives that do not adversely affect the favorable
desired properties. One such example is the addition ethylene glycol to the
condensation reaction of CHDM and TPA.</p><p num="0018">A process for the preparation of a transparent/translucent molding composition
comprises selecting a blend of PCCD, PC and PCTA or PCTG within the
compositional range of ingredients for imparting clear or transparent properties to the 
resulting blend and wherein said proportions of ingredients are selected so as to impart
high heat and chemical resistant properties.</p><p num="0019">The cycloaliphatic polyester resin has repeating units of the formula IA:

polycarbonates are disclosed in U.S. Pat Nos. 2,999,835; 3,038,365; 3,334,154; and
4,131,575.</p><p num="0041">These aromatic polycarbonates can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for
example and as mentioned above, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate
precursor, such as phosgene, in accordance with methods set forth in the above-cited
literature and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,123,436, or by transesterification processes such as
are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those
skilled in the art.</p><p num="0042">It is also possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of
a dihydric phenol with a glycol or with a hydroxy- or acid-terminated polyester or
with a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a 
homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the polycarbonate mixtures of
the invention. Branched polycarbonates are also useful, such as are described in U.S.</p><p num="0043">Pat. No. 4,001,184. Also, there can be utilized blends of linear polycarbonate and a
branched polycarbonate. Moreover, blends of any of the above materials may be
employed in the practice of this invention to provide the aromatic polycarbonate.</p><p num="0044">The preferred aromatic carbonate for use in the practice in the present invention is a
homopolymer, e.g., a homopolymer derived from 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane
(bisphenol-A), commercially available under the trade designation LEXAN Registered
TM from General Electric Company.</p><p num="0045">Additionally, additives such as antioxidants, thermal stabilizers, mold release agents,
antistatic agents, whitening agents, colorants, plasticizers, minerals such as talc, clay,
mica, barite, wollastonite and other stabilizers including but not limited to UV
stabilizers, such as benzotriazole, supplemental reinforcing fillers such as flaked or
milled glass, and the like, flame retardants, pigments, additional resins or
combinations thereof may be added to the compositions of the present invention. The
different additives that can be incorporated in the compositions are commonly used
and known to one skilled in the art. Illustrative descriptions of such additives may be
found in R. Gachter and H. Muller, Plastics Additives Handbook, 4th edition, 1993.</p><p num="0046">Examples of thermal stabilizers include triphenyl phosphite, tris-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)phosphite,
tris-(2,4-di-t-butyl-phenyl) phosphite, tris-(mixed mono-
and di-nonylphenyl)phosphite, dimethylbenzene phosphonate and trimethyl
phosphate. Examples of antioxidants include octadecyl-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate,
and pentaerythrityl-tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate].
Examples of light stabilizers include 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)benzotriazole,
2-(2-hydroxy-5-tert-octylphenyl)-benzotriazole and 2-hydroxy-4-n-octoxy
benzophenone. Examples of plasticizers include dioctyl-4,5-epoxy-hexahydrophthalate,
tris-(octoxycarbonylethyl)isocyanurate, tristearin and
epoxidized soybean oil. Examples of the antistatic agents include glycerol
monostearate, sodium stearyl sulfonate, and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate. </p><p num="0047">A preferred class of stabilizers including quenchers are those which provide a
transparent/translucent and colorless product. Typically, such stabilizers are used at a
level of 0.001-10 weight percent and preferably at a level of from 0.005-2 weight
percent. The favored stabilizers include an effective amount of an acidic phosphate
salt; an acid, alkyl, aryl or mixed phosphite having at least one acidic hydrogen; a
Group IB or Group IIB metal phosphate salt; a phosphorus oxo acid, a metal acid
pyrophosphate or a mixture thereof. The suitability of a particular compound for use
as a stabilizer and the determination of how much is to be used as a stabilizer may be
readily determined by preparing a mixture of the polyester resin component and the
polycarbonate and determining the effect on melt viscosity, gas generation or color
stability or the formation of interpolymer. The acidic phosphate salts include sodium
dihydrogen phosphate, mono zinc phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, calcium
dihydrogen phosphate and the like. The phosphites may be of the formula V:
<img id="img-00120001" orientation="unknown" wi="38" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00120001.tif" inline="no" he="20"/>
where R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup> are independently selected from the group consisting of
hydrogen, alkyl and aryl with the proviso that at least one of R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup> is
hydrogen.</p><p num="0048">The phosphate salts of a Group IB or Group IIB metal include zinc phosphate and the
like. The phosphorus oxo acids include phosphorous acid, phosphoric acid,
polyphosphoric acid or hypophosphorous acid.</p><p num="0049">The polyacid pyrophosphates may be of the formula VI:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">MzxHyPnO3n+1</st32:che>
wherein M is a metal, x is a number ranging from 1 to 12 and y is a number ranging
from 1 to 12, n is a number from 2 to 10, z is a number from 1 to 5 and the sum of
(xz) + y is equal to n + 2. The preferred M is an alkaline or alkaline earth metal. </p><p num="0050">The most preferred quenchers are oxo acids of phosphorus or acidic organo
phosphorus compounds. Inorganic acidic phosphorus compounds may also be used as
quenchers, however they may result in haze or loss of clarity. Most preferred
quenchers are phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid or their partial esters.</p><p num="0051">Examples of mold releasing agents include pentaerythritol tetrastearate, stearyl
stearate, beeswax, montan wax, and paraffin wax. Examples of other resins include
but are not limited to polypropylene, polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and
polyphenylene oxide. Combinations of any of the foregoing additives may be used.
Such additives may be mixed at a suitable time during the mixing of the components
for forming the composition.</p><p num="0052">The production of the compositions may utilize any of the blending operations known
for the blending of thermoplastics, for example blending in a kneading machine such
as a Banbury mixer or an extruder. The sequence of addition is not critical but all
components should be thoroughly blended.</p><p num="0053">To prepare the resin composition, the components may be mixed by any known
methods. Typically, there are two distinct mixing steps: a premixing step and a melt
mixing step. In the premixing step, the dry ingredients are mixed together. The
premixing step is typically performed using a tumbler mixer or ribbon blender.
However, if desired, the premix may be manufactured using a high shear mixer such
as a Henschel mixer or similar high intensity device. The premixing step is typically
followed by a melt mixing step in which the premix is melted and mixed again as a
melt. Alternatively, the premixing step may be omitted, and raw materials may be
added directly into the feed section of a melt mixing device, preferably via multiple
feeding systems. In the melt mixing step, the ingredients are typically melt kneaded in
a single screw or twin screw extruder, a Banbury mixer, a two roll mill, or similar
device.</p><p num="0054">The glass transition temperature of the preferred blend is from about 60Â°C to about
150Â°C, more preferably from 120Â°C to about 150Â°C. </p><p num="0055">The optical properties and impact resistance of the composition make it suitable for
use in building and construction industries, especially for use in a variety of glazing
applications, for example, roofs, greenhouses, sun rooms, swimming pool enclosures,
and the like.</p><p num="0056">The composition may be shaped into a final article by various techniques known in the
art such as injection molding, extrusion, gas assist blow molding, or vacuum forming.</p><p num="0057">A desirable form is an extruded sheet, including solid sheets, multi-wall sheets, and
profiled sheets. There is no particular limitation on the composition of additional
layers used to form coextruded sheets. There is no particular limitation on the
structure or geometry of the multi-wall sheets. The additional layers may comprise,
for example, fluorescing agents to facilitate manufacturing and/or ultraviolet light
absorbers to improve weatherability. The extruded solid sheets typically have a
weight from about 0.5 to about 15 kilograms per square meter, and typically have a
thickness from about 0.5 mm to about 15 mm, preferably from about 1 mm to about
12 mm. The extruded multi-wall sheets typically have a weight from about 0.5 to
about 8 kilograms, and typically have a thickness of about 2 to about 50 mm,
preferable from about 4 to about 40 mm.</p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p num="0058">The following examples employed the materials listed in Table 1 according to the
formulations listed in Tables 2 - 4. All amounts are weight percents based on the
total weight of the composition unless otherwise indicated. All ingredients were
mixed in a ribbon blender and extruded on a Werner-Pleiderer twin screw extruder at
260Â°C to form pellets. The pellets were then fed into an injection moulding machine
to mould discs-test bars. From the tables and FIG. 1, the three component blend of
PC, PCCD, PCTA gives a large compositional space having the desired properties.
As shown in FIG. 1, when the third component is PCT, there is no clear blend shown
on the three component diagram that has the desired properties. As shown in FIG. 1,
when the diol component CHDM additional includes the diol EG, the compositional
space having the desired properties is reduced. </p><heading><u style="single">TABLE 2 TEST PROCEDURES</u></heading><p num="0059">Optical properties (transmission and haze are measured according ASTM D1003.</p><p num="0060">Yellowness index is determined according ASTM D1925 where 3.2 mm thick plaques

carried out on a Zwick 1474 (+HASY). This machine is equipped with an automatic
handling system. Tensile bars of type MPTS (ISO 3167) with the following
dimensions were used: width of 10 mm and thickness of 4 mm.</p><p num="0065">Chemical Resistance: Chemical resistance against 4 different chemicals: 1) Fuel C,
composition: 42.5% Toluene, 42.5% Iso-octane, 15.0% MeOH; 2)Alcohol; 3) Acetic
acid (0.75vol% in water); and 4) Caustic soda (1.0wt% in water). The test is carried
out according to ISO 4599. The following test conditions are used: Duration of the
test: 15 min; Test temperature: 23Â°C; Applied constant strain: 0.5%; The method of
contact: complete soak. After the test the tensile bars were inspected visually on
change in appearance according to the following classification: 1) No visual change;
2) Dull surface; 3) Little cracks or crazes; 4) Large cracks; 5) Break of testing bar.
After the visual inspection the tensile test procedure according to the ISO 527
standard was performed to determine the physical properties. Notched Izod: This test
procedure is based on the ASTM D256 method. In this case, using Izod Method E, the
unnotched impact strength is obtained by testing an unnotched specimen. The results
of the test is reported in terms of energy absorbed per unit of specimen width, and
expressed in foot times pounds per inch (Ft.Lbs./In.). Typically the final test result is
calculated as the average of test results of five test bars. </p><p num="0066">Dynatup impact test: This test procedure is based on the ASTM D3763 method. This
procedure provides information on how a material behaves under multiaxial
deformation conditions. The deformation applied is a high speed puncture. An
example of a supplier of this type of testing equipment is Dynatup. Reported as the
test result is the so-called total energy absorbed (TE), which is expressed in foot
pounds (Ft.Lbs.). The final test result is calculated as the average of the test results of
typically ten test plaques.</p><p num="0067">Melt viscosity: This test procedure is based on the ASTM D1238 method. The
equipment used is an extrusion plastometer equipped with an automatic timer. A
typical example of this equipment would be the Tinius Olson MP 987. Before testing,
the samples are dried for one hour at 150Â°C. The testing conditions are a melt
temperature of 266Â°C, a total load of 5,000 gram, an orifice diameter of 0.0825 inch,
and a dwell time of 5 minutes. The test result is expressed in the unit Poise.</p><p num="0068">Flexural Modulus: This test procedure is based on the ASTM D790 method. Typical
test bars have the following dimensions: 1/8 inch times 1/2 inch times 2-1/2 inch. The
final test result is calculated as the average of test results of five test bars. The test
involves a three point loading system utilizing center loading on a simply supported
beam.</p><p num="0069">Instron and Zwick are typical examples of manufacturers of instruments designed to
perform this type of test. The flexural modulus is the ratio, within the elastic limit, of
stress to corresponding strain and is expressed in pounds per square inch (psi).</p><p num="0070">Tensile Strength: This test procedure is based on the ASTM D638 method. Test bars
in the form of the standard dumbbell shape are used in this test method. The final test
result is calculated as the average of the test results of five test bars. The tensile
strength is calculated by dividing the maximum load observed in the test by the
original minimum cross-sectional area of the test specimen. The result is expressed in
pounds per square inch (psi). Instron and Zwick are typical examples of manufacturers
of instruments designed to perform this type of test. </p><p num="0071">Tensile Elongation: The ability of a material to resist breaking under tensile stress is
based upon ASTM D638. Samples are generally injection molded. The tensile testing
machine pulls the sample from both ends and measures the force required to pull the
specimen apart and how much the sample stretches before breaking. The ultimate
elongation of a plastic is the percentage increase in length that occurs before it breaks
under tension. <img id="img-00180001" orientation="unknown" wi="164" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00180001.tif" inline="no" he="195"/><img id="img-00190001" orientation="unknown" wi="78"
