a tread, of a rubber composition comprised of an amine functionalized
styrene/conjugated diene copolymer elastomer (e.g. styrene/butadiene and/or
styrene/isoprene/butadiene copolymer elastomer) which contains reinforcement
comprised of silanol functionalized particulate carbon black having silica

prepared elastomer which contains pendant and/or terminal amine groups as
one or more of primary amine, secondary amine, tertiary amine, and/or
heterocyclic amine groups. The amine functionalized elastomer may be tin
coupled.</p><heading><u style="single">Background of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0002">Tires are historically prepared with treads of rubber compositions which
are comprised of various diene-based elastomers which are often comprised of
a combination of cis 1,4-polybutadiene with styrene/butadiene copolymer
and/or styrene/isoprene/butadiene copolymer elastomers, although minor
amounts of other elastomers may also be present. For some tires such as, for
example, load bearing truck tires, the tread rubber may be composed of a
significant amount of natural cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber.</p><p num="0003">The rubber compositions for various tire components conventionally
contain particulate reinforcing fillers which may be, for example, rubber
reinforcing carbon black and/or aggregates of precipitated silica.</p><p num="0004">Each of the carbon black and silica particulate reinforcements tend to
provide different aspects of physical reinforcement for the diene-based rubber
composition. The silica usually requires the aid of a coupling agent to couple
the silica to a diene-based elastomer for a more ideal reinforcement of the
rubber composition. For example, a precipitated silica conventionally contains
hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol groups) on its surface which is reactive, for
example, with an alkoxysilane moiety contained in an alkoxysilane polysulfide
based coupling agent. </p><p num="0005">Sometimes, functionalized silica-treated, or silica modified, carbon blacks
are used for the rubber reinforcement which are composed of carbon black
which contains silica domains on its surface and where the silica domains
contain hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol groups) on their surface which are, in turn,
reactive with an alkoxysilane moiety contained in an alkoxysilane polysulfide
based coupling agent. For silica containing carbon blacks, see, for example,
US-A- 5,679,728, 5,830,930, 5,919,841, 5,948,835 and 6,008,272.</p><p num="0006">Such carbon blacks which contain silica domains on their surface are
envisioned as providing attributes of both carbon black reinforcement and silica
reinforcement for diene-based elastomeric rubber compositions. The silica
domains may normally be expected to, in turn, contain hydroxyl groups (e.g.
silanol groups) on their surface which would be reactive with a coupling agent
such as, for example, an alkoxysillane polysulfide based coupling agent. In one
aspect, it might be envisioned that if only a fraction of the surface of the carbon
black contains the silica domains, then only a somewhat corresponding fraction
of a coupling agent (e.g. alkoxysilane polysulfide based coupling agent) need be
used to aid in coupling the particulate reinforcement to a diene-based
elastomer.</p><p num="0007">Various amine functionalized styrene/butadiene copolymer elastomers
have been suggested for use in rubber compositions for various tire
components. For example, see US-A- 6,025,450.</p><p num="0008">A significant aspect of this invention is the use of silanol functionalized
carbon black in combination with an amine functionalized styrene/conjugated
diene copolymer elastomer together with an alkoxysilane polysulfide based
coupling agent.</p><p num="0009">In the description of the invention, the term "phr" relates to parts by
weight of a particular ingredient per 100 parts by weight of rubber contained in a
rubber composition.</p><p num="0010">The terms "rubber" and "elastomer" are used interchangeably unless
otherwise indicated, and the terms "cure" and vulcanize" may be used
interchangeably unless otherwise indicated. The terms "compound" and
"rubber composition may be used interchangeably unless otherwise indicated.</p><heading><u style="single">Summary and Practice of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0011">In accordance with this invention, a tire is provided having at least one
component of a rubber composition according to claim 1.</p><p num="0012">In practice, said amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene 
copolymer elastomers are preferably selected from amine functionalized
styrene/butadiene copolymer and styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymer
elastomers.</p><p num="0013">In practice, said amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene
copolymer may be an amine functionalized styrene/butadiene copolymer which
contains from 5 to 40 weight percent bound styrene based upon the
styrene/butadiene copolymer.</p><p num="0014">In practice, said amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene
copolymer may be an amine functionalized styrene/isoprene/butadiene
terpolymer which contains from 10 to 30 weight percent (units derived from)
styrene, 10 to 70 weight percent (units derived from) isoprene and 10 to 70
weight percent (units derived from) butadiene based upon the
styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymer.</p><p num="0015">In one aspect, for said silanol functionalized carbon black, said silica
domains desirably cover from 10 to 70, alternately from 45 to 65, percent of the
surface of the carbon black. It is believed to be difficult to determine precisely
the percentage of the carbon black surface actually covered by the plurality of
silica domains so that the coverage of the carbon black surface is intended to
mean "approximate" values and is intended to provide a carbon black having a
significant average fraction of its surface covered by the silica domains and to
exclude a carbon black which has its surface completely covered by silica and
exclude a carbon black which may contain silica dispersed within the carbon
black itself but little or no silica domains on its surface. Therefore, it is intended
that the silanol functionalized carbon black presents a surface to the
elastomer(s) which is composed of both carbon black as well as silica which
contains silanol groups and thereby presents a combination of carbon black and
silica reinforcement moieties to the elastomer(s).</p><p num="0016">In one aspect of the invention, the silanol functionalized carbon black is
pre-reacted with an alkoxysilane polysulfide based coupling agent, for example
a bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) polysulfide having an average of from 2 to 4
connecting sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge, to form a composite thereof
prior to addition to the rubber composition. In such manner, then, an alcohol
byproduct (e.g. ethanol) is formed (by reaction of the silanol groups on the silica
treated carbon black and the alkoxy group moiety of the coupling agent) during
the formation of the composite before introducing the ingredients into the rubber
composition instead of in situ within the rubber composition itself which may be
beneficial where alcohol emission within the rubber manufacturing plant or in 
the resulting tire itself might be of a concern.</p><p num="0017">In one aspect, said alkoxysilane polyusulfide based coupling agent may
be a bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) polysulfide having an average of from 2 to 4,
and particularly an average of from 2 to 2.6, or an average of from 3.5 to 4,
connecting sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge.</p><p num="0018">In one aspect, a combination of a first alkoxysilane polysulfide like a bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)
polysulfide having an average of from 2 to 2.6 connecting
sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge and a second polysulfide like a bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)
polysulfide having an average of from 3 to 4 connecting
sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge may be used, wherein said first polysulfide
is blended with said rubber composition in the absence of sulfur and sulfur
vulcanization accelerator and wherein said second is thereafter blended with
said rubber composition in the presence of sulfur and at least one sulfur
vulcanization accelerator.</p><p num="0019">In practice, said amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene
copolymer elastomer and/or said additional conjugated diene-based elastomer
may be a tin coupled elastomer to provide an elastomer of significantly
increased molecular weight and correspondingly increased Mooney (ML 1+4)
viscosity.</p><p num="0020">The amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene copolymer elastomer
may be provided as having at least one terminal amine group and/or as having
pendant amine groups which are distributed along the copolymer itself.</p><p num="0021">For example, the amine groups might be introduced (positioned) along
the copolymer chain by first introducing an amine group onto a monomer used
in the formation of the copolymer. For example, the styrene monomer might be
modified with an amine group. For example, divinylbenzene might be modified
with an amine group and a very small amount of the modified divinylbenzene
introduced into the copolymerization reaction.</p><p num="0022">For example, the amine groups might be introduced (positioned) as one
or more terminal amine groups at an end of the copolymer chain by using an
amine-modified polymerization initiator for the styrene/conjugated diene
copolymerization reaction or by adding a chain terminating agent to the
copolymerization reaction after a suitable copolymer has been formed. A chain
terminating agent may be, for example, a pyrrolidine based material.</p><p num="0023">The said amine groups on the copolymer are considered herein as being
amine groups that may usually be considered as being interactive with a
bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) polysulfide having an average of from 2 to 4 
connecting sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge. In a further aspect of the
invention, the rubber composition of the component of the tire is exclusive of
synthetic amorphous silica reinforcement. In another aspect of the invention,
the carbon black which contains domains of silica on its surface is pre-reacted
with a coupling agent to form a composite thereof prior to addition of amine
functionalized styrene/conjugated diene copolymer elastomer.</p><p num="0024">The following exemplary general formulas are provided as examples of
various amine group substituents on the copolymer and are not intended to be
limiting for this invention. In general, it is envisioned that the copolymer (e.g. a
butadiene moiety of the copolymer) is attached to the amine group by one of the
carbon atoms (a carbon atom included in an "R" group of the amine group)
unless the amine group does not have an "R" group in which case it is
envisioned that the copolymer (e.g. a butadiene moiety of the copolymer) is
attached directly to the nitrogen of the amine group.</p><p num="0025">For example, such amine groups may be of the general formula (I) for
primary, secondary and tertiary amine groups, although such general formula is
not intended to be limiting:
<img id="img-00050001" orientation="unknown" wi="78" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00050001.tif" inline="no" he="26"/>
   wherein x is a value of from 1 or 3, alternately, and usually preferably,
from 2 through 3; and R is selected from saturated straight chain alkyl radicals
and saturated branched alkyl radicals which contain from 1 through 18 carbon
atoms, alternately from 1 through 12 carbon atoms, provided that at least one
saturated alkyl radical contains from 1 through 6 carbon atoms.</p><p num="0026">Such amine groups may be, for example, aryl, alkaryl and aralkyl amine
groups, and may be of the general formula (II), although such general formula is
not intended to be limiting: <img id="img-00060001" orientation="unknown" wi="77" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060001.tif" inline="no" he="48"/>
wherein x is a value of from 1 or 2, R is selected from said saturated straight
chain and said saturated branched alkyl radicals having from 1 through 20
carbon atoms, alternately from 1 through 6 carbon atoms, provided however
that at least one R contains from 1 through 6 carbon atoms.</p><p num="0027">For the above general formulas (I) and (II), representative of said
saturated straight chain alkyl radicals are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,
n-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl radicals. Representative of said saturated
branched alkyl radicals are, for example isobutyl, isopropyl, isopentyl and
isohexyl radicals.</p><p num="0028">Such amine groups may also be heterocyclic amine groups, for example,
selected from pyidine, pyrrolidene and indole based groups. Such heterocyclic
amine groups may be, for example, of the general formulas III-A (pyridines), III-B
(pyrrolidenes), and III-C (indoles) although such general formulas are not
intended to be limiting:
<img id="img-00060002" orientation="unknown" wi="123" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060002.tif" inline="no" he="29"/><img id="img-00060003" orientation="unknown" wi="123" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060003.tif" inline="no" he="28"/><img id="img-00060004" orientation="unknown" wi="123" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060004.tif" inline="no" he="26"/> 
   wherein, for said general formulas (III-A), (III-B) and (III-C), x is a value of
from zero through 2, alternately and preferably 1, and wherein R<sup>2</sup> is a saturated
alkyl radical containing from 1 through 6, alternately and usually preferably from
1 through 3, carbon atoms. The R<sup>2</sup> radicals are appropriately positioned on the
associated ring. For example, for formula III-A, a single R<sup>2</sup> radical may be
positioned in an ortho position to the nitrogen atom. For example, for formula
III-B, a single R<sup>2</sup> radical may be positioned in a meta position to the nitrogen
atom. For example, for formula III-C, a single R<sup>2</sup> radical may be positioned on
the six member ring two carbon atoms away from the five member ring.</p><p num="0029">Representative of said saturated alkyl radicals for R<sup>2</sup> are, for example,
methyl, ethyl and n-propyl radicals.</p><p num="0030">For example, an amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene
copolymer elastomer having at least one terminal amine group may be provided
by copolymerizing styrene and at least one of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene
monomers in an organic solvent solution with a non-cyclic amine initiator such
as 3-(N,N-dimethylamine)-1-propyl lithium as Al-200™ from the FMC company.
It is contemplated that such initiator may be represented by the general formula
(IV) to impart at least one terminal tertiary amine group, as a tertiary amine
group of the aforesaid general formula (I) in that two of the R substituents are
methyl groups and one of the R substituents is an n-propyl group with the
copolymer being attached to the carbon atom of the n-propyl group occupied by
the lithium of the initiator, namely
<img id="img-00070001" orientation="unknown" wi="110" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00070001.tif" inline="no" he="29"/></p><p num="0031">In one aspect, the above amine based initiator may also be provided as
being "chain extended" by containing a minor amount of an isoprene moiety in
its chain which apparently may provide the resultant terminal amine
functionalized styrene/conjugated diene copolymer elastomer of improved
processability by exhibiting a reduced Mooney viscosity of the unvulcanized
elastomer. Exemplary of such initiator is understood to be Al-200 CE™ from
the FMC Company.</p><p num="0032">Alternately, an amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene copolymer
elastomer having at least one terminal amine group may be provided by
copolymerizing styrene with 1,3-butadiene and/or isoprene monomers in an 
organic solvent solution with a pyrrolidine (cyclic amine) based initiator such as
3-pyrrolidino-1-propyl lithium from the FMC Company.</p><p num="0033">In a further aspect, the amine groups may be formed as pendent and/or
terminal groups along the elastomer chain by, for example, pre-reacting divinyl
benzene with a suitable amine to form a modified divinyl benzene which
contains the amine substituent. A small amount (e.g. one to two percent of the
total styrene and 1,3-butadiene monomers) of the modified divinyl benzene is
introduced into the polymerization of the monomers (e.g. styrene with at least
one of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene monomers) at a desirable stage of the
copolymerization process in an organic solvent solution.</p><p num="0034">Alternatively, for preparation of an amine functionalized
styrene/butadiene elastomer, the styrene monomer itself may be modified with,
for example, a pyrrolidone and the modified styrene is copolymerized with at
least one of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene monomer(s) in an organic solvent
solution. It is envisioned that pendant amine groups are thereby provided on
the resulting styrene/conjugated diene copolymer elastomer.</p><p num="0035">Alternatively, a vinyl pyrrolidone may be introduced during the
copolymerization of the styrene with at least one of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene
monomers to effect pendant amine groups from the resultant styrene/butadiene
copolymer elastomer.</p><p num="0036">A significant aspect of this invention is, for a component of a tire (e.g. a
rubber tire tread) use of a rubber composition comprised of the combination of
both an amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene copolymer elastomer
and a silanol functionalized carbon black as a silica treated carbon black
wherein the carbon black has silica domains over a fraction of the surface of the
carbon black and where the silica domains contain hydroxyl groups (silanol
groups) on their surfaces, together with an alkoxysilane polysulide based
coupling agent having an alkoxysilane moiety which may be interactive with one
or more of said amine(s) of said amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene
copolymer elastomer and reactive with said silanol groups of said functionalized
carbon black.</p><p num="0037">This is considered herein to be significant because the amine functional
elastomer can be selectively reacted with the silanol functionalized carbon black
when contained in blends with other diene-based elastomers which have no
amine functionality.</p><p num="0038">An additional significant aspect of the invention is the optional process
limitation which requires the sequential use of said first and second polysulfide 
coupling agents.</p><p num="0039">This is considered herein to be significant because the sequential
coupling agent combination can provide improved coupling of the elastomer,
namely the amine functionalized styrene/conjugated diene copolymer butadiene
elastomer, to reinforcing filler, namely the silanol functionalized carbon black,
with reduced negative effect, such as for example, a reduction in the inherently
increased Mooney viscosity caused by chemical reaction of the coupling agent,
on processing of the unvulcanized rubber composition.</p><p num="0040">In practice of the invention, of said additional conjugated diene-based
elastomers (other than and in addition to said amine functionalized
styrene/butadiene rubber) may be used in the rubber composition for the tire
component.</p><p num="0041">Such diene based elastomers may be, for example, homopolymers and
copolymers of conjugated dienes such as for example isoprene and 1,3-butadiene
and copolymers of such dienes with a vinyl aromatic compound such
as styrene or alphamethyl styrene, preferably styrene.</p><p num="0042">Representative of such additional elastomers are, for example, cis
1,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural and synthetic), cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber,
styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber (prepared by aqueous emulsion or organic
solvent polymerization and other than said functionalized SBR),
styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymer rubber, butadiene/acrylonitrile rubber,
3,4-polyisoprene rubber and isoprene/butadiene copolymer rubber.</p><p num="0043">Preparation of tin coupled styrene/conjugated diene copolymer
elastomers (e.g. styrene/butadiene elastomers), in general, via organic solvent
polymerization is well known to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0044">Tin coupled copolymers of styrene/butadiene and of
styrene/isoprene/butadiene may be prepared, for example, by introducing a tin
coupling agent during the copolymerization reaction in an organic solvent
solution, usually at or near the end of the polymerization reaction. Such
coupling of copolymers is well known to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0045">In practice, it is usually preferred that at least 50 percent and more
generally in a range of 60 to 85 percent of the Sn (tin) bonds in the tin coupled
elastomers are bonded to butadiene units of the styrene/conjugated diene
copolymer to create Sn-dienyl bonds such as butadienyl bonds.</p><p num="0046">Creation of tin-dienyl bonds can be accomplished in a number of ways
such as, for example, sequential addition of butadiene to the copolymerization
system or use of modifiers to alter the styrene and/or butadiene and/or isoprene 
reactivity ratios for the copolymerization. It is believed that such techniques,
whether used with a batch or a continuous copolymerization system, is well
know to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0047">Various tin compounds, particularly organo tin compounds, may be used
for the coupling of the elastomer. Representative of such compounds are, for
example, alkyl tin trichloride, dialkyl tin dichloride, yielding variants of a tin
coupled styrene/butadiene copolymer or styrene/isoprene/butadiene elastomer,
although a trialkyl tin monochloride might be used which would yield simply a
tin-terminated copolymer. Examples of tin-modified, or coupled,
styrene/butadiene copolymer elastomers might be found, for example, in US-A-5,064,901.</p><p num="0048">It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber
composition of the tire component for this invention would be compounded by
methods generally known in the rubber compounding art, such as mixing the
various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers with various commonly used
additive materials such as, for example, curing aids, such as sulfur, activators,
retarders and accelerators, processing additives, such as oils, resins including
tackifying resins, silicas, and plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide,
waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants, peptizing agents and reinforcing
materials such as, for example, carbon black. As known to those skilled in the
art, depending on the intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur
vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned above are selected and
commonly used in conventional amounts.</p><p num="0049">The presence and relative amounts of the above additives are not
considered to be an aspect of the present invention which is more primarily
directed to the utilization of the aforesaid functionalized SBR and carbon black
which contains hydroxyl functionalized silica domains on its surface for a tire
tread rubber composition.</p><p num="0050">The tires can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various methods
which will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0051">The invention may be better understood by reference to the following
examples in which the parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise
indicated.</p><p num="0052">For the examples, various organic solvent solution polymerization
prepared styrene/butadiene elastomers (S-SBR) and organic solvent solution
