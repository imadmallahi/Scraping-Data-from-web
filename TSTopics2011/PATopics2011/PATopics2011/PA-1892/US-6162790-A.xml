This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly well suited for inhibiting ICE activity and consequently, may be advantageously used as agents against interleukin-1- ("IL-1") and apoptosis-mediated diseases, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, and degenerative diseases. This invention also relates to methods for inhibiting ICE activity and methods for treating interleukin-1- and apoptosis-mediated diseases using the compounds and compositions of this invention.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Interleukin 1 ("IL-1") is a major pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory protein that stimulates fibroblast differentiation and proliferation, the production of prostaglandins, collagenase and phospholipase by synovial cells and chondrocytes, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and neutrophil activation. Oppenheim, J. H. et al, Immunology Today, 7, pp. 45-56 (1986). As such, it is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 is both a mediator of inflammatory symptoms and of the destruction of the cartilage proteoglycan in afflicted joints. IL-1 is also a highly potent bone resorption agent. It is alternatively referred to as "osteoclast activating factor" in destructive bone diseases such as osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma. Bataille, R. et al., Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res., 21, p. 283 (1992). In certain proliferative disorders, such as acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma, IL-1 can promote tumor cell growth and adhesion. In these disorders, IL-1 also stimulates production of other cytokines such as IL-6, which can modulate tumor development. Tartour et al., Cancer Res. 54, 6243 (1994).</p><p>IL-1 is predominantly produced by peripheral blood monocytes as part of the inflammatory response and exists in two distinct agonist forms, IL-1 Î± and IL-1 Î². Mosely, B. S. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 84, pp. 4572-4576 (1987); Lonnemann, G. et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 19, pp. 1531-1536 (1989).</p><p>IL-1 Î² is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor, pIL-1 Î². pIL-1 Î² lacks a conventional leader sequence and is not processed by a signal peptidase. March, C. J., Nature, 315, pp. 641-647 (1985). Instead, pIL-1 Î² is cleaved by interleukin-1 Î² converting enzyme ("ICE") between Asp-116 and Ala-117 to produce the biologically active C-terminal fragment found in human serum and synovial fluid. Sleath, P. R., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, pp. 14526-14528 (1992); A. D. Howard et al., J. Immunol., 147, pp. 2964-2969 (1991).</p><p>ICE is a cysteine protease localized primarily in monocytes. It converts precursor IL-1 Î² to the mature form. Black, R. A. et al., FEBS Lett., 247, pp. 386-390 (1989); Kostura, M. J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86, pp. 5227-5231 (1989). Processing by ICE is also necessary for the transport of mature IL-1 Î² through the cell membrane. ICE, or its homologues, also appears to be involved in the regulation of cell death or apoptosis. Yuan, J. et al., Cell, 75, pp. 641-652 (1993); Miura, M. et al., Cell, 75, pp. 653-660 (1993); Nett-Fiordalisi, M. A. et al., J. Cell Biochem., 17B, p. 117 (1993). In particular, ICE or ICE homologues are thought to be associated with the regulation of apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Marx, J. and M. Baringa, Science, 259, pp. 760-762 (1993); Gagliardini, V. et al., Science, 263, pp. 826-828 (1994).</p><p>ICE has been demonstrated to mediate apoptosis (programmed cell death) in certain tissue types. Steller, H., Science, 267, p. 1445 (1995); Whyte, M. and Evan, G., Nature, 376, p. 17 (1995); Martin, S. J. and Green, D. R., Cell, 82, p. 349 (1995); Alnemri, E. S., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, p. 4312 (1995); Yuan, J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol., 7, p. 211 (1995). Therapeutic applications for inhibition of apoptosis may include treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, spinal atrophy, and aging. A transgenic mouse with a disruption of the ICE gene is deficient in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Kuida, et al. (1995). This activity of ICE is distinct from its role as the processing enzyme for pro-IL-1 Î². It is conceivable that in certain tissue types, inhibition of ICE may not affect secretion of mature IL-1 Î², but may inhibit apoptosis.</p><p>ICE has been previously described as a heterodimer composed of two subunits, p20 and p10 (20 kDa and 10 kDa molecular weight, respectively). These subunits are derived from a 45 kDa proenzyme (p45) by way of a p30 form, through an activation mechanism that is autocatalytic. Thornberry, N. A. et al., Nature, 356, pp. 768-774 (1992). The ICE proenzyme has been divided into several functional domains: a rag prodomain (p14), a p22/20 subunit, a polypeptide linker and a p10 subunit. Thornberry et al., supra; Casano et al., Genomics, 20, pp. 474-481 (1994).</p><p>Full length p45 has been characterized by its cDNA and amino acid sequences. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577 and WO 94/00154. The p20 and p10 cDNA and amino acid sequences are also known. Thornberry et al., supra. Murine and rat ICE have also been sequenced and cloned. They have high amino acid and nucleic acid sequence homology to human ICE. Miller, D. K. et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 696, pp. 133-148 (1993); Molineaux, S. M. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 90, pp. 1809-1813 (1993). The three-dimensional structure of ICE has been determined at atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography. Wilson, K. P., et al., Nature, 370, pp. 270-275 (1995). The active enzyme exists as a tetramer of two p20 and two p10 subunits.</p><p>Additionally, there exist human homologs of ICE with sequence similarities in the active site regions of the enzymes. Such homologs include TX (or ICE.sub.rel-II or ICH-2) (Faucheu, et al., EMBO J., 14, p. 1914 (1995); Kamens J., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, p. 15250; Nicholson et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270 15870 (1995)), TY (or ICE.sub.rel-III) (Nicholson et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, p. 15870 (1995)), ICH-1 (or Nedd-2) (Wang, L. et al., Cell, 78, p. 739 (1994)), MCH-2, (Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., Cancer Res., 55, p. 2737 (1995), CPP32 (or YAMA or apopain). Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269, p. 30761 (1994); Nicholson, D. W. et al., Nature, 376, p. 37 (1995)), and CMH-1 (or MCH-3) (Lippke, et al., J. Biol Chem., (1996); Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., Cancer Res., (1995)). Each of these ICE homologs, as well as ICE itself, is capable of inducing apoptosis when overexpressed in transfected cell lines. Inhibition of one or more of these homologs with the peptidyl ICE inhibitor Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone results in inhibition of apoptosis in primary cells or cell lines. Lazebnik et al., Nature, 371, p. 346 (1994). The compounds described herein are also capable of inhibiting one or more homologs of ICE (see example). Therefore, one can envisage using these compounds to inhibit apoptosis in tissue types that contain ICE homologs, but which do not contain active ICE or produce mature IL-1 Î².</p><p>ICE inhibitors represent a class of compounds useful for the control of inflammation or apoptosis or both. Peptide and peptidyl inhibitors of ICE have been described. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577; WO 93/05071; WO 93/09135; WO 93/14777 and WO 93/16710; and</p><p>European patent application 0 547 699. Such peptidyl inhibitors of ICE have been observed to block the production of mature IL-1 Î² in a mouse model of inflammation (Ku, et al. or vide infra) and to suppress growth of leukemia cells in vitro (Estrov, et al., Blood, 84, p. 380a (1994)).</p><p>Accordingly, the need exists for compounds that can effectively inhibit the action of ICE in vivo, for use as agents for preventing and treating chronic and acute forms of IL-1-mediated diseases, apoptosis-mediated diseases, as well as inflammatory, autoimmune, bone-destructive, proliferative, infectious, degenerative, or necrotic diseases.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention provides novel classes of compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, that are useful as inhibitors of ICE. These compounds can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, such as antibiotics, immunomodulators or other anti-inflammatory agents, for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases mediated by IL-1 or by apoptosis. According to a preferred embodiment, the compounds of this invention are capable of binding to the active site of ICE and inhibiting the activity of that enzyme.</p><p>It is a principal object of this invention to provide novel classes of inhibitors of ICE represented by formulas: ##STR1## wherein the various substituents are described herein.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS          AbbreviationsDesignation    Reagent or Fragment______________________________________Ala            alanineArg            arginineAsn            asparagineAsp            aspartic acidCys            cysteineGln            glutamineGlu            glutamic acidGly            glycineHis            histidineIle            isoleucineLeu            leucineLys            lysineMet            methioninePhe            phenylalaninePro            prolineSer            serineThr            threonineTrp            tryptophanTyr            tyrosineVal            valineAc.sub.2 O     acetic anhydriden-BU           normal-butylDMF            dimethylformamideDIEA           N,N-diisopropylethylamineEDC            1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-          ethylcarbodiimide hydrochlorideEt.sub.2 O     diethyl etherEtOAc          ethyl acetateFmoc           9-fluorenylmethyoxycarbonylHBTU           O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N',N'-          tetramethyluronium          hexafluorophosphateHOBT           1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrateMeOH           methanolTFA            trifluoroacetic acid______________________________________</pre></p><heading>DEFINITIONS</heading><p>The following terms are employed herein:</p><p>The term "active site" refers to any or all of the following sites in ICE: the substrate binding site, the site where an inhibitor binds and the site where the cleavage of substrate occurs.</p><p>The term "alkenyl", alone or in combination, refers to a straight-chain or branched-chain alkenyl radical containing from 2 to 10, carbon atoms.

Advantageously, these compounds are conveniently synthesized from readily available starting materials.</p><p>The compounds of this invention are among the most readily synthesized ICE inhibitors known. Previously described ICE inhibitors often contain four or more chiral centers and numerous peptide linkages. The relative ease with which the compounds of this invention can be synthesized represents an advantage in the large scale production of these compounds.</p><p>It should be understood that the compounds of this invention may exist in various equilibrium forms, depending on conditions including choice of solvent, pH, and others known to the practitioner skilled in the art. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. In particular, many of the compounds of this invention, especially those which contain aldehyde or ketone groups in R.sub.1 and carboxylic acid groups (R.sub.2 âH), may take hemi-ketal (or hemi-acetal) or hydrated forms. For example, when R.sub.1 is --(CO)--H and R.sub.2 is --H compounds of this invention may take the forms depicted below: ##STR11##</p><p>Depending on the choice of solvent and other conditions known to the practitioner skilled in the art, compounds of this invention may also take acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal or acetal form: ##STR12##</p><p>In addition, it should be understood that the equilibrium forms of the compounds of this invention may include tautomeric forms. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention.</p><p>It should be understood that the compounds of this invention may be modified by appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. In addition, the compounds may be altered to pro-drug form such that the desired compound is created in the body of the patient as the result of the action of metabolic or other biochemical processes on the pro-drug. Such pro-drug forms typically demonstrate little or no activity in in vitro assays. Some examples of pro-drug forms include ketal, acetal, oxime, and hydrazone forms of compounds which contain ketone or aldehyde groups, especially where they occur in the R.sub.1 group of the compounds of this invention. Other examples of pro-drug forms include the hemi-ketal, hemi-acetal, acylox, ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal, and acetal forms that are described in EQ1 and EQ2.</p><p>The compounds of this invention are excellent ligands for ICE. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting events in IL-1- and apoptosis-mediated diseases and, thus, the ultimate activity of that protein in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, and degenerative diseases. For example, the compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IL-1 Î² to mature IL-1 Î² by inhibiting ICE. Because ICE is essential for the production of mature IL-l, inhibition of that enzyme effectively blocks initiation of IL-1 mediated physiological effects and symptoms, such as inflammation, by inhibiting the production of mature IL-1. Thus, by inhibiting IL-1 Î² precursor activity, the compounds of this invention effectively function as IL-1 inhibitors.</p><p>The compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment of diseases which are mediated by IL-1 or apoptosis. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a patient suffering from an IL-1- or apoptosis-mediated disease in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of that disease.</p><p>Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in compositions and methods for treating or protecting individuals against IL-1- or apoptosis-mediated diseases over extended periods of time. The compounds may be employed in such compositions either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of ICE inhibitors in pharmaceutical compositions. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period time against IL-1- or apoptosis-mediated diseases.</p><p>The compounds of this invention may also be co-administered with other ICE inhibitors to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various IL-1- or apoptosis-mediated diseases.</p><p>In addition, the compounds of this invention may be used in combination either conventional anti-inflammatory agents or witty matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, lipoxygenase inhibitors and antagonists of cytokines other than IL-1 Î².</p><p>The compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO) or with prostaglandins, to prevent or combat IL-1- or apoptosis-mediated disease symptoms such as inflammation.</p><p>When the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention may be comprised of a combination of an ICE inhibitor of this invention and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent.</p><p>Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise any of the compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. We prefer oral administration. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant such as those described in Ph. Helv. (Pharmacopeia Helvetica) or a similar alcohol.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspensions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.</p><p>Topical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches are also included in this invention.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.</p><p>Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 1 and 50 mg/kg body weight per day of the active ingredient compound are useful in the prevention and treatment of IL-1- and apoptosis-mediated diseases, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, degenerative diseases, osteoarthritis, pancreatitis, asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, glomeralonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupu, erythematosus, scleroderma, chronic thyroiditis, Graves' disease, autoimmune gastritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type I), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, graft vs. host disease, osteoporosis, multiple myeloma-related bone disorder, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, metastatic melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple myeloma sepsis, septic shock, Shigellosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia, myocardial ischemia, spinal muscular atrophy, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related encephalitis, HIV-related encephalitis, and neurological damage due to stroke. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.</p><p>Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency o administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence or disease symptoms.</p><p>As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the disease, and the patient's disposition to the disease and the judgment of the treating physician.</p><p>The IL-1 or apoptosis-mediated diseases which may be treated or prevented by the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, degenerative, and necrotic diseases.</p><p>Inflammatory diseases which may be treated or prevented include, but are not limited to osteoarthritis, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, asthma, and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

The assay mixture contains:</p><p>65 Î¼l buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @ pH 8.1)</p><p>10 Î¼l ICE (50 nM final concentration to give a rate of Ë1 mOD/min)</p><p>5 Î¼l DMSO/Inhibitor mixture</p><p>20 Î¼l 400 Î¼M Substrate (80 Î¼M final concentration)</p><p>100 Î¼l total reaction volume</p><p>The visible ICE assay is run in a 96-well microtiter plate. Buffer, ICE and DMSO (if inhibitor is present) are added to the wells in the order listed. The components are left to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes starting at the time that all components are present in all wells. The microtiter plate reader is set to incubate at 37 minute incubation, substrate is added directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored by following the release of the chromophore (pNA) at 405-603 nm at 37 performed and the rate is calculated in mOD/min. DMSO is only present during experiments involving inhibitors, buffer is used to make up the volume to 100 Î¼l in the other experiments.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading><p>The following K.sub.i values were determined for compounds 706, 710, 719, 720, 725-727, 729, 731, 733, 743, 745, and 747-757 using the assay described in Example 1.
