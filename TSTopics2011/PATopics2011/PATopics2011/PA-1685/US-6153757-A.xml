The invention further relates to the uses of these compounds, salts and prodrugs for the therapeutic treatment of humans or animals.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases ("MMPs") are a family of enzymes, including, but not limited to, collagenases, gelatinases, matrilysin, and stromelysins, which are involved in the degradation and remodelling of connective tissues. These enzymes are found in a number of cell types that are found in or associated with connective tissue, such as fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and metastatic tumor cells. They also share a number of properties, including zinc and calcium dependence, secretion as zymogens, and 40-50% amino acid sequence homology.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases degrade the protein components of the extracellular matrix, i.e. the protein components found in the linings of joints, interstitial connective tissue, basement membranes, cartilage and the like. These proteins include collagen, proteoglycan, fibronectin and lamanin.</p><p>Collagen is the major structural protein of mammalian tissue, comprising one-third of the total protein in mammalian organisms, and is an essential component of many matrix tissues, including cartilage, bone, tendons and skin. Interstitial collagenases catalyze the initial (rate-limiting) cleavage of native collagen types I, II, III and X. These enzymes cleave collagen into two fragments which spontaneously denature at physiological temperature. Denaturation of collagen involves conversion of the rigidly coiled helix to a random coil referred to as gelatin. These gelatin (denatured collagen) fragments are then subject to further cleavage and degradation by less specific enzymes. The net result of collagenase cleavage is thus the loss of structural integrity in the matrix tissue (collagen collapse), an essentially irreversible process.</p><p>The gelatinases include two distinct yet highly related enzymes: a 72-kiloDalton (kDa) enzyme and a 92-kiloDalton enzyme. The former is released by fibroblasts while the latter is released by mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, corneal epithelial cells, tumor cells, cytotrophoblasts and keratinocytes. Both enzymes degrade gelatins (denatured collagens), collagen types IV (basement membrane) and V, fibronectins (high molecular weight multifunctional glycoproteins found in soft connective tissue and basement membranes) and insoluble elastin (highly cross-linked hydrophobic proteins found in load bearing fibers of mammalian connective tissue).</p><p>Stromelysins (1 and 2) cleave a broad range of matrix substrates, including lamanin, fibronectins, proteoglycans and collagen types IV and IX (non-helical).</p><p>Matrilysin (putative metalloproteinase or PUMP) also degrades a wide variety of matrix substrates, including proteoglycans, gelatins, fibronectins, elastins and lamanin. Matrilysin has been found in mononuclear phagocytes, rat uterine explants and tumor cells.</p><p>In normal tissues, the activity of matrix metalloproteinases is tightly regulated. As a result, the breakdown of connective tissue mediated by these enzymes is generally in a dynamic equilibrium with synthesis of new matrix tissue.</p><p>In a number of pathological disease conditions, however, deregulation of matrix metalloproteinase activity leads to the uncontrolled breakdown of extracellular matrix. These disease conditions include arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis), periodontal disease, aberrant angiogenesis, tumor metastasis and invasion, tissue ulceration (e.g., corneal ulceration, gastric ulceration or epidermal ulceration), bone disease, HIV-infection and complications from diabetes.</p><p>Administration of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors has been found to reduce the rate of connective tissue degradation, thereby leading to a favorable therapeutic effect. For example, in Cancer Res., vol. 53, p. 2087 (1993), a synthetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor was shown to have in vivo efficacy in a murine model for ovarian cancer with an apparent mode of action consistent with inhibition of matrix remodelling. The design and uses of MMP inhibitors are reviewed, for example, in J. Enzyme Inhibition, 2, 1-22 (1987); Progress in Medicinal Chemistry 29, 271-334 (1992); Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2, 743-762 (1995); Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 5, 1287-1296 (1995); and Drug Discovery Today, 1, 16-26 (1996).</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors are also the subject of numerous patents and patent applications, including: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,189,178; 5,183,900; 5,506,242; 5,552,419; 5,455,258; European Patent Application No. 0 438 223; European Patent Application No. 0 276 436; WIPO International Publication No. WO 92/21360; WIPO International Publication No. WO 92/06966; WIPO International Publication No. WO 92/09563; WIPO International Publication No. WO 96/00214; WIPO International Publication No. 95/35276; and WIPO International Publication No. WO 96/27583, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor-∝ ("TNF-α") is a cytokine which is produced as a 28-kDa precursor and released in an active 17-kDa form. This active form can mediate a large number of deleterious effects in vivo, including inflammation, fever, cardiovascular effects, haemorrhage, coagulation and acute phase responses, similar to those seen during acute infections and shock states. Chronic administration of TNF-α can cause cachexia and anorexia; accumulation of excess of TNF-α can be fatal.</p><p>TNF-α convertase is a metalloproteinase involved in the biosynthesis of TNF-α. Inhibition of TNF-α convertase inhibits production of TNF-α.</p><p>Since excessive TNF-α production has been noted in several disease conditions characterized by MMP-mediated tissue degradation, including multiple sclerosis, arthritis and cancer, compounds which inhibit both MMPs and TNF-α convertase are especially advantageous for the treatment or prophylaxis of disease conditions in which both mechanisms are involved. Although compounds that both inhibit MMPs activity and TNF-α production have been disclosed in WIPO International Publication Nos.

A compound of formula 7 is treated with an activated sulfonic acid derivative 4 to give the corresponding sulfonamide 8. The ester functionality Q in compound 8 is deprotected to give compound 9, which is then activated by formation of an acid chloride or other suitable activating group. The activating group is displaced by hydroxylamine or a suitable salt or derivative of hydroxylamine to give the hydroxamic acid 10. The activated diarylether sulfonic acid derivative 4 can be prepared from the diaryl ether 2 by chlorosulfonation directly to the sulfonyl chloride or by a stepwise process of sulfonation to the sulfonic acid 3, followed by conversion to the sulfonyl chloride or other suitably activated sulfonic acid derivative.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS</heading><p>A number of diarylethers 2 are commercially available. In cases where the diarylether is not commercially available, the first step of the process involves preparing the diarylether 2. In the case where D is nitrogen, compounds 2 can be made by combining either 4-chloropyridine hydrochloride or 1-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium chloride hydrochloride with phenol or thiophenol at or above 100 xylenes, or other suitable solvent.</p><p>In Step 2 of the process, the diaryl ether is treated with chlorosulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide, or other suitable sulfonating agent to give the sulfonic acid 3, which is used directly or isolated by water quench followed by solvent removal or extraction into a suitable water immiscible organic solvent. In some cases, a quaternary ammonium salt such as tetrabutylammonium bromide can be used to increase the solubility of the sulfonic acid 3 in organic solvents.</p><p>Step 3 of the process involves adding thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, chlorosulfonic acid, phosphorus pentachloride, or another suitable chlorinating reagent to the sulfonic acid 3 in acetonitrile, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, or another suitable organic solvent. The resulting sulfonyl chloride 4 can be isolated by solvent removal or water quench followed by filtration or extraction. Alternatively, the sulfonic acid 3 can be converted to the sulfonyl fluoride with fluorosulfonic acid or sulfonyl bromide with thionyl bromide. If desired, the sulfonyl chloride, sulfonyl fluoride, and sulfonyl bromide compounds can be converted to the more stable triazolide or benzotriazolide derivatives by treatment with 1,2,4-triazole or benzotriazole respectively.</p><p>In Step 4, compound 5 is converted to a suitable silyl or carbon ester. In the cases where a silyl ester is utilized, trimethylsilyl chloride, tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, dimethylthexylsilyl chloride, triisopropylsilyl chloride, or another suitable silylating reagent is added to a mixture of compound 5 and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 4-methylmorpholine, pyridine, or other suitable tertiary amine base in N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dichloroethane, or other suitable aprotic solvent. The resulting mixture of the silyl ester 6 can be used directly in Step 5, or the silyl ester can be isolated by aqueous work-up, extraction, and solvent removal.</p><p>In the cases where a carbon ester is utilized, a mixture of compound 5 and sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or another suitable organic or mineral acid in methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 1-butanol, tert-butanol, allyl alcohol, or other suitable alcohol solvent is heated at reflux for 4 to 60 hours. The resulting ester is isolated as either the free base or amine salt by solvent removal and/or aqueous work-up, followed by extraction with an appropriate solvent and finally solvent removal or salt formation by addition of an appropriate acid. Alternatively, the tert-butyl ester can be prepared by maintaining a mixture of compound 5 in liquid isobutylene, a suitable organic solvent such as 1,4-dioxane, and a suitable mineral acid or organic acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride, or p-toluenesulfonic acid at reflux for 4 to 60 hours.</p><p>In Step 4A, compound 5 is mixed with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or other suitable organic or inorganic base, and 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, or other suitable activitated two carbon moiety in 1,2-dichloroethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, methanol, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, water or other appropriate solvent. The resulting tetrahydro-2H-1,4-thiazine derivative 11 is isolated by precipitation, followed by filtration or by solvent removal. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid functionality of compound 5 can be protected in-situ by addition of trimethylsilyl chloride and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. The resulting silyl ester is treated with 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, or another suitable activated two carbon moiety and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene or another suitable tertiary amine base in 1,2-dichloroethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, or other suitable aprotic solvent. The silyl ester is deprotected in-situ by addition of methanol, 2-propanol, or another alcoholic solvent and the resulting tetrahydro-2H-1,4-thiazine derivative 11 is isolated by precipitation and filtration.</p><p>In Step 5, the ester 6 is treated with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or other suitable organic or inorganic base, and 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, or other suitable activitated two carbon moiety in 1,2-dichloroethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, methanol, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, or other appropriate solvent. The resulting tetrahydro-2H-1,4-thiazine derivative 7 is isolated by precipitation or aqueous work-up followed by extraction with an organic solvent and solvent removal.</p><p>In Step 5A, compound 11 is converted to a suitable silyl or carbon ester. In the cases where a silyl ester is utilized, trimethylsilyl chloride, tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, dimethylthexylsilyl chloride, triisopropylsilyl chloride, or another suitable silylating reagent is added to a mixture of compound 11 and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 4-methylmorpholine,pyridine, or other suitable tertiary amine base in N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dichloroethane, or other suitable aprotic solvent. The resulting mixture of the silyl ester 7 can be used directly in Step 6, or the silyl ester can be isolated by aqueous work-up, extraction, and solvent removal.</p><p>In the cases where a carbon ester is utilized, a mixture of compound 11 and sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or another suitable organic or mineral acid in methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 1-butanol, tert-butanol, allyl alcohol, or other suitable alcohol solvent is heated at reflux. The resulting ester is isolated as either the free base or amine salt by solvent removal and/or aqueous work-up, followed by extraction with an appropriate solvent, and finally solvent removal or salt formation by addition of an appropriate acid. Alternatively, the tert-butyl ester can be prepared by maintaining a mixture of compound 11 in 1,4-dioxane or other suitable solvent, liquid isobutylene, and sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or another suitable mineral acid or organic acid at reflux.</p><p>Alternatively, the tetrahydro-2H-1,4-thiazine derivative 11 can be left unprotected and used directly in Step 6. In this case, Step 5A is simply omitted.</p><p>In Step 6, the tetrahydro-2H-1,4-thiazine derivative 7 or 11 and the activated diarylether sulfonic acid derivative 4 are combined in dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate, toluene, tert-butyl methyl ether, or another suitable solvent in the presence of 4-methylmorpholine, pyridine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, potassium carbonate, or another suitable organic tertiary amine base or inorganic base. The resulting sulfonamide derivative 8 is isolated by aqueous work-up, extraction into an appropriate organic solvent, and solvent removal.</p><p>Step 7 involves the deprotection of the ester protecting group of compound 8 to give carboxylic acid 9. In the cases where a silyl ester is utilized, deprotection is accomplished by maintaining a mixture of the ester and methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or another alcohol solvent at 20 C. to reflux and isolating the product by filtration or solvent removal. Alternatively, silyl esters can be deprotected by treatment with mineral acid or acetic acid in either organic or aqueous solution or by treatment with fluoride ion in organic solution.</p><p>In the cases where a carbon ester is utilized, the ester can by removed by heating a mixture of compound 8 and hydrogen chloride, sulfuric acid, or other mineral in water, dioxane or another suitable organic solvent at reflux. Alternatively, the ester can be removed by treatment with sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or another suitable inorganic base in water or a combination of water and methanol, tetrahydrofuran, or another suitable organic solvent. In the case where Q is allyl, the ester can be removed by treatment with N-methylaniline, morpholine, or another suitable secondary amine and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) or another suitable palladium(0) catalyst in ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, or another suitable organic solvent. In the case where Q is benzyl, the ester can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation.</p><p>The final step of the process is a two-step procedure involving in-situ activation of the carboxyl functionality of compound 9 and subsequent displacement with hydroxylamine or a suitable salt or derivative of hydroxylamine. The activation is accomplished by reaction of compound 9 with oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride with or without N,N-dimethylformamide present as catalyst in dichloromethane, acetonitrile, or other suitable solvent to give the corresponding acid chloride. Alternatively, the carboxyl can be activated by addition of methanesulfonyl chloride, isobutylchloroformate or various other chloroformate reagents, 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or other carbodiimide reagents. The activated compound is added to hydroxylamine or a suitable salt or derivative of hydroxylamine and an appropriate organic or inorganic base, if necessary, in water, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, tert-butyl alcohol, dichloromethane, or other suitable solvent or solvent combinations.

Cleavage results in the loss of energy transfer and a large increase in fluorescence of the MCA group. ##STR56## 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl-acetyl-pro-leu-gly-leu-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2-3-diaminoproprionyl-ala-arg-NH.sub.2</p><p>The MCA assay was performed at 37 Tricine (pH 7.5), 10 mM CaCl.sub.2, 200 mM NaCl, and 1% DMSO with the following concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases: 1.4 nM stromelyin, 0.063 nM matrilysin, and 0.030 nM gelatinase A. The concentration of MCA substrate was 10 or 20 μM in a final volume of 1.6 mL. Fluorescence data was collected with Perkin-Elmer LS-5B and LS-5B spectrofluorimeters with λ.sub.excitation =328 nm and λ.sub.emission =393 nm. Spectrofluorimeters were interfaced with IBM-compatible microcomputer systems.</p><p>Competitive Inhibition Analyses</p><p>The K.sub.m for the MCA peptide substrate with the matrix metalloproteinases is quite high and exceeds its solubility under assay conditions. Consequently, the apparent K.sub.i (K.sub.i,app) was determined to describe the strength of inhibition. However, in this case, K.sub.i,app would be essentially equal to K.sub.i since [S]&amp;lt;&amp;lt;K.sub.m. For the determination of K.sub.i,app, the concentration of the inhibitor was varied at a constant and low concentration of substrate and the steady-state rates of fluorescence change determined. In most cases absorptive quench due to the presence of ligand was not observed. For slow-binding inhibitors, onset of inhibition curves were collected for at least 45 minutes so that equilibrium was established. Steady-state rates of fluorescence change were obtained by fitting a curve to an equation for a single exponential decay containing a linear phase. The fitted value of the linear phase was taken as the steady-state rate. The steady-state rates were fitted to the Michaelis equation describing competitive inhibition by non-linear methods. Data resulting from tight-binding inhibition was analyzed, and K.sub.i,app determined by fitting the data to the tight-binding equation of Morrison See (Biochem. Biophys. Acta, vol. 185, pp. 269-286 (1969)) by non-linear methods.</p><p>The results of the above-described tests are presented below in Table 1.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 1__________________________________________________________________________Enzyme Inhibition Constants (K.sub.1) nM                                                        I-a ##STR57##Variable                                Enzyme*  W   X              Y     Z  Ar       HSLN Matr.

innoculation of the murine Lewis lung carcinoma (NIH) tumor line. This tumor line produces spontaneous lung metastases which arise from the primary tumor. Primary tumor growth was monitored by measuring the length and width of the subcutaneous tumor using calipers; lung metastases were counted at the end of the experiment (22 days after tumor implantation) by removing the lungs and counting the lesions using a dissecting microscope. The test compound was administered daily, i.p., beginning 24 hours after tumor implantation (day 1) and continuing through day 21. Primary tumor volumes and number of lung metastases were compared to control animals using an ANOVA followed by a comparison of means using the F statistic. For example, the compound of example 9(a), at a dosage of 50 mg/kg, produced a statistically significant (p&amp;lt;0.025) tumor growth delay, calculated as the delay in reaching 1000 mm.sup.3 tumor volume between control and treated animals, and in the number of lung metastases (p&amp;lt;0.05) relative to the control. All drugs were administered at 50 mg/kg, i.p., daily, Day 1-Day 21. The results are presented in Table 2 below.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 2______________________________________Example No.    Tumor Growth Delay                  % Inhibition-Lung Metastases______________________________________5(a)     2.0 days      13.6%8(a)     -0.1 days     7.5%7(a)     0.0 days      16.1%9(a)     7.2 days (p &amp;lt; 0.025)                  77.6% (p &amp;lt; 0.05)______________________________________</pre></p><p>Arthritis Model</p><p>Previously frozen bovine nasal cartilage plugs weighing approximately 20 mg were embedded in polyvinyl sponges impregnated with Myobacterium tuberculosis and implanted subcutaneously in female Lewis rats. Dosing was begun 9 days after implantation and the plugs were harvested about one week later. The plugs were weighed and then hydrolyzed and the hydroxyproline content measured. Efficaciousness was determined by the comparison of the compound-treated groups with vehicle-treated controls.
