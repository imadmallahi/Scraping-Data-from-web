compositions wherein a silicone diorganopoly-siloxane is dispersed in a
thermoplastic resin and dynamically vulcanized therein. More
particularly, our invention provides a thermoplastic elastomer wherein
the silicone component contains silanol functionality and is cured with
an SiH-functional crosslinker in the presence of particular condensation
catalysts.</p><p num="0002">Thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are polymeric materials which
possess both plastic and rubbery properties. They have elastomeric
mechanical properties but, unlike conventional thermoset rubbers, can be
re-processed at elevated temperatures. This re-processability is a
major advantage of TPEs over chemically crosslinked rubbers since it
allows recycling of fabricated parts and results in a considerable
reduction of scrap.</p><p num="0003">In general, two main types of thermoplastic elastomers are known.
Block copolymer thermoplastic elastomers contain both "hard" and "soft"
plastic segments. "Hard" plastic segments have a melting point or g]ass
transition temperature above ambient temperature. "Soft" polymeric
segments have a glass transition considerably below room temperature.
In these systems, the hard segments aggregate to form distinct
microphases and act as physical crosslinks for the soft phase, thereby
imparting a rubbery character at room temperature. At elevated
temperatures, the hard segments melt or soften allowing the copolymer to
flow and to be processed like an ordinary thermoplastic resin.</p><p num="0004">Alternatively, a thermoplastic elastomer referred to as a simple
blend (physical blend) can be obtained by uniformly mixing an
elastomeric component with a thermoplastic resin. When the elastomeric
component is also cross-linked, a thermoplastic elastomer known in the 
art as a thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) results. Since the crosslinked
elastomeric phase of a TPV is insoluble and non-flowable at elevated
temperature, TPVs generally exhibit improved oil and solvent resistance
as well as reduced compression set relative to the simple blends.</p><p num="0005">Typically, a TPV is formed by a process known as dynamic
vulcanization, wherein the elastomer and the thermoplastic matrix are
mixed and the elastomer is cured with the aid of a crosslinking agent
and/or catalyst during the mixing process. A number of such TPVs are
known in the art, including some wherein the crosslinked elastomeric
component can be a silicone polymer while the thermoplastic component is
an organic, non-silicone polymer (i.e., a thermoplastic silicone
vulcanizate or TPSiV). In such a material, the elastomeric component
can be cured by various mechanisms, but it has been shown that the use
of a non-specific catalyst, such as an organic peroxide, can also result
in at least a partial cure of the thermoplastic resin itself, thereby
reducing or completely destroying ability to re-process the composition
(i.e., it no longer is a thermoplastic elastomer). In other cases, the
peroxide causes partial degradation of the thermoplastic resin. To
address these problems, elastomer-specific crosslinkers, such as
organohydrido silicon compounds, can be used to cure alkenyl-functional
elastomers.</p><p num="0006">US Patent 4,500,688 discloses semi-interpenetrating networks (IPN)
wherein a vinyl-containing silicone fluid having a viscosity of 500 to
100,000 cS is dispersed in a conventional thermoplastic resin. Arkles
only illustrates these semi-IPNs at relatively low levels of silicone.
The vinyl-containing silicone is vulcanized in the thermoplastic during
melt mixing according to a chain extension or crosslinking mechanism
which employs a silicon hydride-containing silicone component. This
dsclosure is expanded by US Patent 4,714,739 to include hybrid silicones
containing unsaturated groups prepared by reacting a hydride-containing
silicone with an organic polymer having unsaturated functionality. US
Patent 4,910,263 further extends the above concepts to systems wherein 
the semi-IPN is crosslinked by hydrolysis of alkoxysilyl groups on the
polymer network. The product is said to have improved chemical
resistance and mechanical properties as well as excellent temperature
resistance and electrical properties.</p><p num="0007">In our copending US patent application 09/034,089, we also teach
the preparation of TPSiVs wherein silicone gum is dispersed in an
organic resin and subsequently dynamically vulcanized therein via a
hydrosilation cure system. Under certain conditions, such systems were
shown to have significantly improved mechanical properties over the
corresponding simple blends of resin and silicone gum in which the gum
was not cured. Unfortunately, only polyolefin or poly(butylene
teraphthalate) resins were suitable and attempts to prepare a similar
TPSiV based on other resins proved unsuccessful. Mechanical properties
of the dynamically vulcanized system were comparable to those of the
corresponding simple blend. Moreover, many resins may contain groups
that can "poison" (i.e., inactivate) the platinum catalyst used to
promote the hydrosilation reaction. Some resins also contain residual
unsaturation (e.g., styrene-butadiene-styrene, styrene-isoprene-styrene)
which would react with the SiH-functional cure agent in the above
mentioned systems, thereby depleting this crosslinker and potentially
crosslinking the resin itself.</p><p num="0008">Although the above cited publications disclose the
preparation of thermoplastic elastomer compositions using various
thermoplastic resins as the matrix and a dispersed silicone phase which
is dynamically vulcanized therein, they do not teach TPSiVs wherein the
silicone is cured by a condensation reaction which is not sensitive to
the above mentioned poisoning phenomenon.</p><p num="0009">We have discovered various organic thermoplastic resins can
be used as the matrix in a TPSiV wherein a silicone component is cured
via a condensation reaction between a silanol-functional silicone fluid
or gum and an organohydrido silicon crosslinker. Surprisingly, we have
found that when this condensation reaction is catalyzed by a platinum 
species, the resulting TPSiV has poor processing characteristics and/or
poor mechanical properties relative to a similar system wherein the
catalyst is selected from metal carboxylate, amine or quaternary
ammonium compounds. The compositions of the present invention also show
a significant improvement in mechanical properties relative to a
corresponding simple blend wherein the silicone component is not cured,
as in the case of systems disclosed in US patent application 09/034,089.
This is of great commercial significance since the vulcanization
procedure, and the cure agents required therefor, add to both the
complexity and the expense of the preparation. Vulcanization would be
avoided in many applications if essentially identical mechanical
properties could be obtained without its employ.</p><p num="0010">The present invention, therefore, relates to a method for
preparing a thermoplastic elastomer, said method comprising:
<sl><li>(I) first mixing
<sl><li>(A) a thermoplastic resin selected from polyolefins,
polyamides, thermoplastic polyurethanes or styrenic block copolymers,</li><li>(B) at least one diorganopolysiloxane having an average of
at least 2 silanol groups in its molecule,</li><li>(C) optionally, up to 300 parts by weight of a filler for
each 100 parts by weight of said diorganopolysiloxane, said filler being
selected from
<sl><li>(i) a reinforcing filler for said diorganopolysiloxane or</li><li>(ii) a silicone resin,</li></sl></li><li>(D) an organohydrido silicon compound which contains an
average of at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen groups in its molecule,
and</li><li>(E) a platinum-free condensation catalyst,
components (D) and (E) being present in an amount sufficient to cure
said diorganopolysiloxane; and</li></sl></li><li>(II) dynamically curing said diorganopolysiloxane (B), 
wherein the amount of said diorganopolysiloxane (B) used is such that at
least one property of the thermoplastic elastomer selected from tensile
strength or elongation is at least 25% greater than the respective
property for a corresponding blend wherein said diorganopolysiloxane is
not cured and said thermoplastic elastomer has an elongation of at least
25%.</li></sl></p><p num="0011">Preferably component (A) is used in an amount of 20 to 80 wt-% and
component (B) is used in an amount on 80 to 20 wt-% each based on the
total weight of components (A) and (B).</p><p num="0012">A thermoplastic elastomer which is prepared according to the above
described method is also provided.</p><p num="0013">Component (A) of the present invention is a thermoplastic resin or
a thermoplastic elastomer selected from polyolefins, polyamides,
thermoplastic polyurethanes or thermoplastic styrenic block copolymers
or a blend of two or more such systems. This component must have a melt
point (T<sub>m</sub>) or glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) above room temperature
(RT) but must not be crosslinked. Thus, although it is a solid under
normal ambient conditions, it readily flows upon the application of a
shearing stress when heated above its melt point or glass transition
temperature (i.e., melt flow).</p><p num="0014">Suitable polyamide resins are exemplified by nylon 66, nylon 12,
nylon 46, nylon 610 and nylon 6.</p><p num="0015">Polyolefin resin may be selected from homopolymers of
olefins as well as interpolymers of one or more olefins with each other
and/or up to about 40 mole percent of one or
more monomers which are copolymerizable with the olefins. Examples of
suitable polyolefins include homopolymers of ethylene, propylene,
butene- 1, isobutylene, hexene, 1,4-methylpentene-1, pentene-1, octene-1,
nonene-1 and decene-1, inter alia. These polyolefins can be prepared
using peroxide, Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalysts, as well known in
the art. Interpolymers of two or more of the above mentioned olefins
may also be employed as component (A) and they may also be copolymerized 
with, e.g., vinyl or diene compounds or other such compounds which can
be copolymerized with the olefins.</p><p num="0016">Specific examples of suitable interpolymers are ethylene-based
copolymers, such as ethylene-propylene copolymers, ethylene-butene-1
copolymers, ethylene-hexene-1 copolymers, ethylene-octene-1
copolymers, ethylene-butene-1 copolymers and interpolymers of ethylene
with two or more of the above mentioned olefins.</p><p num="0017">The polyolefin may also be a blend of two or more of the
above mentioned homopolymers or interpolymers. For example, the blend
can be a uniform mixture of one of the above systems with one or more of
the following: polypropylene, high pressure, low density polyethylene,
high density polyethylene, polybutene-1 and polar monomer-containing
olefin copolymers such as ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers,
ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers, ethylene/methyl acrylate copolymers,
ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers,
ethylene/acrylic acid/ethyl acrylate terpolymers and ethylene/acrylic
acid/vinyl acetate terpolymers, inter alia.</p><p num="0018">Preferred polyolefins include polyethylene (PE) polymers such as
low pressure, substantially linear, ethylene homopolymers and
interpolymers of ethylene with alpha-olefins having 3 to 10 carbon
atoms. Such interpolymers are known as linear low density polyethylene
(LLDPE) in the art. Preferably, these systems have a density of 0.85 to
0.97 g/cc, more preferably 0.875 to 0.930 g/cc, and weight average
molecular weight of about 60,000 to about 1,000,000.</p><p num="0019">Other preferred polyolefins include polypropylene (PP)
resins, such as atactic, syndiotactic or isotactic PP. These are
typically homopolymers of propylene or interpolymers of propylene with
minor proportions of ethylene. Such PP systems can have the ethylene
polymerized randomly with propylene units or a number of ethylene units
may be linked to form a block copolymer.</p><p num="0020">Thermoplastic elastomeric styrenic block copolymers of the
invention are exemplified by styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymers 
(SBS), styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymers (SEBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene
copolymers (SIS), hydrogenated versions of the above,
and the like. Specific commercial representatives include such resins
as KRATON® D1102 and KRATON® FG1901X from Shell.</p><p num="0021">Thermoplastic polyurethanes comprise urethane hard segments
and polyesters or polyether soft segments. Specific commercial
embodiments include PELLETHANE™ (Upjohn), ESTANE™ (Goodrich), SPANDEX™
(DuPont) and TEXIN™ (Mobay), inter alia.</p><p num="0022">However, we have found that various other resins will not
form the desired TPSiV according to the instant method. For example,
polyester resins tend to crosslink under the dynamic vulcanization
conditions, described infra. Use of polystyrene as component (A)
results in compositions having very poor mechanical integrity.</p><p num="0023">Diorganopolysiloxane (B) is a fluid or gum having a viscosity
of at least 10 Pa·s at 25°C. which is terminated with silanol (i.e., -
SiOH) groups. The silicon-bonded organic groups of component (B) are
independently selected from hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon groups.
These may be specifically exemplified by alkyl groups having 1 to 20
carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl;
cycloalkyl groups, such as cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl; alkenyl groups
having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, such as vinyl, allyl and hexenyl; aryl groups
having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, tolyl and xylyl; aralkyl
groups having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, such as benzyl and phenethyl; and
halogenated alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl
and chloromethyl. These groups are selected such that the
diorganopolysiloxane has a glass transition temperature (or melt point)
below room temperature and forms an elastomer when cured, as described
infra. Methyl preferably makes up at least 85, more preferably at least
90, mole percent of the silicon-bonded organic groups in component (B).</p><p num="0024">The polydiorganosiloxane (B) can be a homopolymer, a copolymer
or a terpolymer containing such organic groups. Examples include fluids
or gums comprising dimethylsiloxy 
units and phenylmethylsiloxy units; dimethylsiloxy units and
diphenylsiloxy units; and dimethylsiloxy units, diphenylsiloxy units and
phenylmethylsiloxy units, among others. The molecular structure is also
not critical and is exemplified by straight-chain and partially branched
straight-chain, linear structures being preferred.</p><p num="0025">Specific illustrations of organopolysiloxane (B) include
dimethylhydroxysiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane homopolymers;
dimethylhydroxysiloxy-endblocked methylphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane
copolymers: and dimethylhydroxysiloxy-endblocked
methylphenylpolysiloxanes. Preferred systems for low temperature
applications include silanol-functional methylphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane
copolymers and diphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane
copolymers, particularly wherein the molar content of the dimethylsiloxane
units is 93%.</p><p num="0026">Component (B) may also consist of combinations of two or more
organopolysiloxane fluids or gums. Most preferably, component (B) is a
polydimethylsiloxane homopolymer which is terminated with a silanol group
at each end of the molecule.</p><p num="0027">Preferably, the molecular weight of the diorganopolysiloxane
is sufficient to impart a Williams plasticity number of at least 30 as
determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test
method 926. The plasticity number, as used herein, is defined as the
thickness in millimeters x 100 of a cylindrical test specimen 2 cm<sup>3</sup> in
volume and approximately 10 mm in height after the specimen has been
subjected to a compressive load of 49 Newtons for three minutes at 25°C.
Although there is no absolute upper limit on the plasticity of component
(B), practical considerations of processability in conventional mixing
equipment generally restrict this value. Preferably, the plasticity
number should be 100 to 200, most preferably 120 to 185. We have found
that such gums are readily dispersed in resin (A) without the need for
filler (C), described infra. </p><p num="0028">In case component (B) is a fluid diorganopolysiloxane having a
viscosity of 10 to 100 Pa·s at 25°C. it is preferred but not mandatory to
mix the fluid with up to 300 parts by weight of filler (C), described
infra, for each 100 parts by weight of (B) to facilitate dispersion.
Preferably, the fluid and filler are mixed before adding this combination
to resin (A), but these can be added seperately.</p><p num="0029">Methods for preparing the above described fluid and high
consistency silanol-containing polydiorganosiloxanes are well known and
many such hydroxyl-terminated silicones are available commercially.</p><p num="0030">Filler (C) is selected from (i) reinforcing fillers or (ii)
silicone resins. When (B) is a gum having a plasticity of at least 30,
this filler is an optional component which can often enhance mechanical
properties of the resulting TPSiV. But, as suggested above, inclusion
of this filler is preferred when the diorganopolysiloxane is a fluid
having a viscosity less than 100 Pa·s in order to facilitate dispersion
of the latter in component (A). In this case, up to 300 parts by weight
of the filler (C) is used for each 100 parts by weight of
diorganopolysiloxane (B).</p><p num="0031">Component (i) can be any filler which is known to reinforce
diorganopolysiloxane (B) and is preferably selected from finely divided,
heat stable minerals such as fumed and precipitated forms of silica,
silica aerogels and titanium dioxide having a specific surface area of
at least 50 m<sup>2</sup>/gram. The fumed form of silica is a preferred
reinforcing filler based on its high surface area, which can be up to
450 m<sup>2</sup>/gram and a fumed silica having a surface area of 50 to 400 m<sup>2</sup>/g,
most preferably 200 to 380 m<sup>2</sup>/g, is highly preferred. When used,
reinforcing filler (i) is added at a level of about 20 to 200 parts by
weight, preferably 20 to 150 and most preferably 20 to 100 parts by
weight, for each 100 parts by weight of component (B).</p><p num="0032">If a fumed silica filler is employed, it is preferably
treated to render its surface hydrophobic by reacting the silica with a
liquid organosilicon compound containing silanol groups or hydrolyzable 
precursors of silanol groups. Compounds that can be used as filler
treating agents, also referred to as anti-creping agents or plasticizers,
include low molecular weight liquid hydroxy- or alkoxy-terminated
polydiorganosiloxanes, hexaorganodisiloxanes, cyclodimethylsilazanes and

hydroxy-terminated (i.e., silanol) diorganopolysiloxane having an average
degree of polymerization (DP) of 2 to 100, more preferably 2 to 10 and
it is used at a level of 5 to 50 parts by weight for each 100 parts by
weight of the silica filler. When component (B) is the preferred silanol-functional
polydimethylsiloxane, this treating agent is preferably a

essentially of R<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub> siloxane units (M units) and SiO<sub>4/2</sub> siloxane units
(Q units). By the term "soluble", it is meant that the organopolysiloxane
can be dissolved in either a hydrocarbon liquid such as benzene, toluene,
xylene, heptane and the like or in a silicone liquid such as cyclic or
linear polydiorganosiloxanes. Preferably the resin is technologically
compatible with component (B). In the above formula, R denotes a
monovalent radical independently selected from hydrocarbon or halogenated
hydrocarbon radicals having fewer than 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 10
carbon atoms. Examples of suitable R radicals include alkyl radicals,
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, pentyl, octyl, undecyl and octadecyl;
cycloalphatic radicals, such as cyclohexyl; aryl radicals such as phenyl,
tolyl, xylyl, benzyl and 2-phenylethyl; alkenyl radicals such as vinyl;
and chlorinated hydrocarbon radicals such as 3-chloropropyl and
dichlorophenyl. The silicone resins, also referred to as "MQ resins," are
well known in the art. They may be prepared, for example, by the silica
hydrosol capping process of U.S. Patent 2,676,18. Such resins typically
also contain from 0.5 to 4 weight percent silanol functionality wherein
the latter group replaces some of the R groups in the above described M
and Q units. </p><p num="0034">To enhance the compatibility of component (ii) in component
(B), it is desirable to select the predominant R radicals of the former to
match the organic radicals of diorganopolysiloxane (B). Preferably, at
least one-third, and more preferably substantially all R radicals of resin
(ii) are methyl radicals. The methyl radicals can be distributed in any
desired arrangement among the R<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub> siloxane units; however, it is
preferred that each R<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub> siloxane unit bear at least one, and more
preferably at least two, methyl radicals. Examples of preferred R<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub>
siloxane units include Me<sub>3</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub>, PhMe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>1/2</sub> and Ph<sub>2</sub>MeSiO<sub>1/2</sub> where Me
hereinafter denotes methyl and Ph hereinafter denotes phenyl. Preferred MQ
resins have an M to Q ratio of 0.4 to 1.1, a number average molecular
weight of 2,000 to 15,000 and a polydispersity of 1.0 to 6.0.</p><p num="0035">When used, silicone resin (ii) is added at a level of 20 to
300 parts by weight, preferably 25 to 200 and most preferably 50 to 150

(i.e., the sum of these functionalities must be greater than 4 on
average). The position of the silicon-bonded hydrogen in component (D) is
not critical and may be bonded at the molecular chain terminals, in nonterminal
positions along the molecular chain or at both positions. The
silicon-bonded organic groups of component (D) are independently selected
from any of the hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon groups described
above in connection with diorganopolysiloxane (B), including preferred

compound which will promote the condensation reaction between the SiOH
groups of diorganopolysiloxane (B) and the SiH groups of organohydrido
silicon compound (D) so as to cure the former by the formation of -Si-O-Si- bonds. However, as noted above, catalyst (E) can not be a platinum
compound or complex since the use of such a condensation catalyst often
results in poor processing as well as poor physical properties of the
resulting TPSiV.</p><p num="0043">Examples of suitable catalysts include metal carboxylates,
such as dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dilaurate, tin tripropyl
acetate, stannous octoate, stannous oxalate, stannous naphthanate:
amines, such as triethyl amine, ethylenetriamine; and quaternary
ammonium compounds, such as benzyltrimethylammoniumhydroxide, beta-hydroxyethylltrimethylammonium-2-ethylhexoate
and beta-hydroxyethylbenzyltrimethyldimethylammoniumbutoxide
(see, e.g., United
States Patent 3,024,210).</p><p num="0044">In addition to the above mentioned major components (A) though
(E), a minor amount (i.e., less than 50 weight percent of the total
composition) an optional additive (F) can be incorporated in the TPSiV
compositions of our invention. This optional additive can be extending
fillers such as quartz, calcium carbonate and diatomaceous earth; pigments
such as iron oxide and titanium oxide, electrically conducting fillers
such as carbon black and finely divided metals, heat stabilizers such as
hydrated cerric oxide, flame retardants such as halogenated hydrocarbons,
alumina trihydrate, magnesium hydroxide, organophosphorous compounds and
other fire retardant (FR) materials. These additives are typically added 
to the final TPSiV composition after dynamic cure, but they may also be
added at any point in the preparation provided they do not interfere with
the dynamic vulcanization mechanism.</p><p num="0045">According to the method of the present invention, the thermoplastic
elastomer is prepared by thoroughly dispersing diorganopolysiloxane (B),
and optionally component (C), in thermoplastic (A) and then dynamically
vulcanizing the diorganopolysiloxane using organohydrido silicon compound
(C) and catalyst (E). Mixing is carried out in any device which is
capable of uniformly dispersing the components in the resin, such as an
internal mixer or a twin-screw extruder, the latter being preferred for
commercial preparations. Mixing temperature is preferably kept as low
as practical consistent with good mixing so as not to decompose the
resin. Order of mixing is not critical and, for example, components (B)
and (C) can be separately introduced. However, components (B) through
(D) should be well dispersed in thermoplastic (A) before catalyst (E) is
added and dynamic vulcanization begins. Preferably, (C) is dispersed in
(B) and this blend is blended with the thermoplastic resin before the
dynamic vulcanization step. Optimum temperatures, mixing times and other
conditions of the mixing operation depend upon the particular resin and
other components under consideration. These may be determined by routine
experimentation by those skilled in the art.</p><p num="0046">In a first preferred mixing procedure, thermoplastic resin (A) is
first melted in an internal mixer at a controlled temperature which is
just above the melt point to 100°C. above the melt point of the resin
and a master blend of components (B) through (D) is mixed in for 2 to 10
minutes. Thus, for example, this range is from the respective melt
point of the resin to 200°C. for PP and PE and up to 250°C. for Nylon
12. The master blend can be prepared by mixing diorganopolysiloxane (B)
with organohydrido silicon compound (D), filler (C), when used, and any
optional inhibitors, stabilizers, plasticizers or other additives for
component (B), this mixing is carried out, e.g., on a two-roll mill at
room temperature. When a preferred diorganopolysiloxane gum, as 
described supra is used, a mixture thereof with filler and various
additives is known as a rubber base in the silicone rubber art, and the
cure agent (D) may be included therein or it may be added just prior to
dynamic vulcanization. When a thermoplastic elastomer having a low
durometer (i.e., softer) is desired, 10 to 50 parts by weight of a nonfunctional
diorganopolysiloxane fluid having a viscosity of 10,000 to
100,000 mPa·s at 25°C. per 100 parts by total weight of components (B)
and (C) may be included in the silicone base. As the master blend is
introduced, the viscosity of the composition first increases, then
decreases and finally levels off. Once a uniform dispersion of
components (A) through (D) has been obtained, catalyst (E) is added and
the viscosity again increases, and then levels off, as mixing is
continued and the silicone is dynamically vulcanized for a
time sufficient to again establish a steady state melt viscosity,
typically 1 to 30 minutes.</p><p num="0047">In a second preferred embodiment, the above described master blend
(i.e., components (B), (D) and optionally (C)) is introduced to the
mixer and the thermoplastic resin is then added and the system
dynamically cured using catalyst (E), as above.</p><p num="0048">In a third preferred embodiment, the above mixing is carried out
in a twin-screw extruder wherein resin (A) is fed to the extruder
through a hopper and components (B) through (E) are introduced into the
extruder, with the catalyst (E) being separately fed in at a location
furthest downstream. In a variation of this procedure, the filler is
introduced along with the resin through the hopper. Preferably, the
extruder size is sufficient to accomplish the mixing and curing in one
pass.</p><p num="0049">As noted above, the tensile strength, elongation, or both, of the
TPSiVs must be at least 25% greater than that of a corresponding simple
blend. Our invention further requires that the TPSiV has at least 25%
elongation, as determined by the test described infra. In this context,
the term "simple blend" denotes a composition wherein the weight 
proportions of thermoplastic resin (A), diorganopolysiloxane (B) and
filler (C), if used, are identical to the proportions in the TPSiV, but
no cure agents are employed (i.e., either component (D) or (E), or both,
are omitted and the gum is therefore not cured). In order to determine
if a particular composition meets the above criterion, the tensile
strength of the TPSiV is measured on dumbbells having a length of 25.4
mm and a width of 3.2 mm and a typical thickness of 1 to 2 mm, according
to ASTM method D 412, at an extension rate of 50 mm/min. Three such
samples are evaluated and the middle value is selected for comparison of
tensile and elongation. This value is then compared to the
corresponding middle value of a sample prepared from the simple blend
composition. We have observed that when the level of the silicone
component is too low, at least a 25% improvement in tensile and/or
elongation over the simple blend is not realized and there is no benefit
derived from the dynamic vulcanization. Although the range of
diorganopolysiloxane consistent with this requirement depends upon the
particular thermoplastic resin and other components selected, it is
preferred to use 25% to 75%, more preferably 25 to 60%, of thermoplastic
resin (A) based on the total weight of components (A) through (E).
However, the upper limit of silicone content is determined by
processability considerations since too high a level results in at least
a partially crosslinked composition. This limit is the highest level of
components (B) and (C), when used, which allows the TPSiV to be readily
processed by conventional plastic operations such as molding and
extrusion. A thermoplastic elastomer of the present invention which has
been re-processed in this manner typically has mechanical properties
which are approximately the same as those of the initial TPSiV.</p><p num="0050">The thermoplastic elastomer prepared by our method can then be
processed by conventional techniques, such as extrusion, vacuum forming,
injection molding, blow molding or compression molding, to fabricate
plastic parts. Moreover, these compositions can be re-processed
(recycled) with little or no degradation of mechanical properties. </p><p num="0051">Our novel thermoplastic elastomers can be used for wire and cable
insulation, sealing, automotive and appliance components, belts and
hoses, construction seals, bottle closures and general rubber
applications.</p><p num="0052">The following examples are presented to further illustrate the
