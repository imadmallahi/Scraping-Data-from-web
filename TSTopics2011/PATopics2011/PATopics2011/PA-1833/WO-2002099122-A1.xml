The contents of the prior applications are hereby incorporated in their entirety.</p><p num="p0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p> <p num="p0005">The p53 gene is mutated in over 50 different types of human cancers, including familial and spontaneous cancers, and is believed to be the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer (Zambetti and Levine, FASEB (1993) 7:855-865; Hollstein, et al, Nucleic Acids Res. (1994) 22:3551-3555). Greater than 90% of mutations in the p53 gene are missense mutations that alter a single amino acid that inactivates p53 function. Aberrant forms of human p53 are associated with poor prognosis, more aggressive tumors, metastasis, and short survival rates (Mitsudomi et al., Clin Cancer Res 2000 Oct; 6(10):4055-63; Koshland, Science (1993) 262:1953).</p><p num="p0006">The human p53 protein normally functions as a central integrator of signals including DNA damage, hypoxia, nucleotide deprivation, and oncogene activation (Prives, Cell (1998) 95:5-8). In response to these signals, p53 protein levels are greatly increased with the result that the accumulated p53 activates cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the nature and strength of these signals. Indeed, multiple lines of experimental evidence have pointed to a key role for p53 as a tumor suppressor (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331). For example, homozygous p53 "knockout" mice are developmentally normal but exhibit nearly 100% incidence of neoplasia in the first year of life (Donehower et al., Nature (1992) 356:215-221).</p><p num="p0007">The biochemical mechanisms and pathways through which p53 functions in normal and cancerous cells are not fully understood, but one clearly important aspect of p53 function is its activity as a gene-specific transcriptional activator. Among the genes with known p53-response elements are several with well-characterized roles in either regulation of the cell cycle or apoptosis, including GADD45, p21/Waf 1/Ci l, cyclin G, Bax, IGF- BP3, andMDM2 (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331).</p><p num="p0008">The ability to manipulate the genomes of model organisms such as Drosophila provides a powerful means to analyze biochemical processes that, due to significant evolutionary conservation, have direct relevance to more complex vertebrate organisms. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
Due to a high level of gene and pathway conservation, the strong similarity of cellular processes, and the functional conservation of genes between these model organisms and mammals, identification of the involvement of novel genes in particular pathways and their functions in such model organisms can directly contribute to the understanding of the correlative pathways and methods of modulating them in mammals (see, for example, Mechler BM et al., 1985 EMBO J 4:1551-1557; Gateff E. 1982 Adv. Cancer Res. 37: 33- 74; Watson KL., et al., 1994 J Cell Sci. 18: 19-33; Miklos GL, and Rubin GM. 1996 Cell 86:521-529; Wassarman DA, et al., 1995 Curr Opin Gen Dev 5: 44-50; and Booth DR. 1999 Cancer Metastasis Rev. 18: 261-284). For example, a genetic screen can be carried out in an invertebrate model organism having underexpression (e.g. knockout) or overexpression of a gene (referred to as a "genetic entry point") that yields a visible phenotype. Additional genes are mutated in a random or targeted manner. When a gene mutation changes the original phenotype caused by the mutation in the genetic entry point, the gene is identified as a "modifier" involved in the same or overlapping pathway as the genetic entry point. When the genetic entry point is an ortholog of a human gene implicated in a disease pathway, such as p53, modifier genes can be identified that may be attractive candidate targets for novel therapeutics.</p><p num="p0009">All references cited herein, including sequence information in referenced Genbank identifier numbers and website references, are incorporated herein in their entireties.</p> <p num="p0010">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have discovered genes that modify the p53 pathway in Drosophila, and identified their human orthologs, hereinafter referred to as HM. The invention provides methods for utilizing these p53 modifier genes and polypeptides to identify candidate therapeutic agents that can be used in the treatment of disorders associated with defective p53 function. Preferred HM-modulating agents specifically bind to HM polypeptides and restore p53 function. Other preferred HM-modulating agents are nucleic acid modulators such as antisense oligomers and RNAi that repress HM gene expression or product activity by, for example, binding to and inhibiting the respective nucleic acid (i.e. DNA or mRNA).</p> <p num="p0011">HM-specific modulating agents may be evaluated by any convenient in vitro or in vivo assay for molecular interaction with an HM polypeptide or nucleic acid. In one embodiment, candidate p53 modulating agents are tested with an assay system comprising a HM polypeptide or nucleic acid. Candidate agents that produce a change in the activity 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
of the assay system relative to controls are identified as candidate p53 modulating agents. The assay system may be cell-based or cell-free. HM-modulating agents include HM related proteins (e.g. dominant negative mutants, and biotherapeutics); HM-specific antibodies; HM-specific antisense oligomers and other nucleic acid modulators; and chemical agents that specifically bind HM or compete with HM binding target. In specific embodiments, the screening assay system is selected from a binding assay, an apoptosis assay, a cell proliferation assay, an angiogenesis assay, and a hypoxic induction assay.</p> <p num="p0012">In another embodiment, candidate p53 pathway modulating agents are further tested using a second assay system that detects changes in the p53 pathway, such as angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation changes produced by the originally identified candidate agent or an agent derived from the original agent. The second assay system may use cultured cells or non-human animals. In specific embodiments, the secondary assay system uses non-human animals, including animals predetermined to have a disease or disorder implicating the p53 pathway, such as an angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation disorder (e.g. cancer).</p><p num="p0013">The invention further provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway in a mammalian cell by contacting the mammalian cell with an agent that specifically binds a HM polypeptide or nucleic acid. The agent may be a small molecule modulator, a nucleic acid modulator, or an antibody and may be administered to a mammalian animal predetermined to have a pathology associated the p53 pathway.</p><p num="p0014">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0015">Genetic screens were designed to identify modifiers of the p53 pathway in Drosophila in which p53 was overexpressed in the wing (Ollmann M, et al., Cell 2000 101: 91-101). Modifiers of the wing phenotype were identified as a modifier of the p53 pathway.</p><p num="p0016">Accordingly, vertebrate orthologs of these modifiers, and preferably the human orthologs, HM genes (i.e., nucleic acids and polypeptides) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of pathologies associated with a defective p53 signaling pathway, such as cancer. Table 1 lists the modifiers and their orthologs. In vitro and in vivo methods of assessing HM function are provided herein.</p><p num="p0017">Modulation of the HM or their respective binding partners is useful for understanding the association of the p53 pathway and its members in normal and disease conditions and for developing diagnostics and therapeutic modalities for p53 related pathologies. HM- modulating agents that act by inhibiting or enhancing HM expression, directly or 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
indirectly, for example, by affecting an HM function such as enzymatic (e.g., catalytic) or binding activity, can be identified using methods provided herein. HM modulating agents are useful in diagnosis, therapy and pharmaceutical development.</p><p num="p0018">Nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention</p><p num="p0019">Sequences related to HM nucleic acids and polypeptides that can be used in the invention are disclosed in Genbank (referenced by Genbank identifier (GI) number), shown in Table 1 and in the sequence listing .</p><p num="p0020">A review of the nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention reveals several categories of proteins, and their functional domains. Preferred HMs are enzymes or soluble proteins with ligand binding sites, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, proteases, protease inhibitors, helicases, polymerases, prolylisomerases, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), a range of metabolic enzymes, proteins involved in ubiquitination, DNA methylation and metabolism, RNA processing or binding, and adapters, among others. Alternative preferred targets are membrane proteins, such as G protem coupled receptors (GPCRs), protein kinase receptors, transporters, and ligand-gated ion channels, among others.</p><p num="p0021">The term "HM polypeptide" refers to a full-length HM protein or a functionally active fragment or derivative thereof. A "functionally active" HM fragment or derivative exhibits one or more functional activities associated with a full-length, wild-type HM protem, such as antigenic or immunogenic activity, enzymatic activity, ability to bind natural cellular substrates, etc. The functional activity of HM proteins, derivatives and fragments can be assayed by various methods known to one skilled in the art (Current Protocols in Protein Science (1998) Coligan et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Somerset, New Jersey) and as further discussed below. For purposes herein, functionally active fragments also include those fragments that comprise one or more structural domains of an HM, such as a kinase domain or a binding domain. Protein domains can be identified using the PFAM program (Bateman A., et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1999, 27:260- 2; http://pfam.wustl.edu). Methods for obtaining HM polypeptides are also further described below. In some embodiments, preferred fragments are functionally active, domain-containing fragments comprising at least 25 contiguous amino acids, preferably at least 50, more preferably 75, and most preferably at least 100 contiguous amino acids of a domain-encoding region of an HM protein.

 The term "HM nucleic acid" refers to a DNA or RNA molecule that encodes a HM polypeptide. Preferably, the HM polypeptide or nucleic acid or fragment thereof is from a human, but can also be an ortholog, or derivative thereof with at least 70% sequence identity, preferably at least 80%, more preferably 85%, still more preferably 90%, and most preferably at least 95% sequence identity with HM. Normally, orthologs in different species retain the same function, due to presence of one or more protein motifs and/or 3- dimensional structures. Orthologs are generally identified by sequence homology analysis, such as BLAST analysis, usually using protein bait sequences. Sequences are assigned as a potential ortholog if the best hit sequence from the forward BLAST result retrieves the original query sequence in the reverse BLAST (Huynen MA and Bork P, Proc Natl Acad Sci (1998) 95:5849-5856; Huynen MA et al, Genome Research (2000) 10:1204-1210). Programs for multiple sequence alignment, such as CLUSTAL (Thompson JD et al, 1994, Nucleic Acids Res 22:4673-4680) may be used to highlight conserved regions and/or residues of orthologous proteins and to generate phylogenetic trees. In a phylogenetic tree representing multiple homologous sequences from diverse species (e.g., retrieved through BLAST analysis), orthologous sequences from two species generally appear closest on the tree with respect to all other sequences from these two species. Structural threading or other analysis of protein folding (e.g., using software by ProCeryon, Biosciences, Salzburg, Austria) may also identify potential orthologs. In evolution, when a gene duplication event follows speciation, a single gene in one species, such as Drosophila, may correspond to multiple genes (paralogs) in another, such as human. As used herein, the term "orthologs" encompasses paralogs. As used herein, "percent (%) sequence identity" with respect to a subject sequence, or a specified portion of a subject sequence, is defined as the percentage of nucleotides or amino acids in the candidate derivative sequence identical with the nucleotides or amino acids in the subject sequence (or specified portion thereof), after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, as generated by the program WU-BLAST-2.0al9 (Altschul etal, J. Mol. Biol. (1997) 215:403-410; http://blast.wustl.edu/blast/README.html) with all the search parameters set to default values. The HSP S and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched. A % identity value is determined by the number of matching identical nucleotides or amino acids divided by the sequence length for which the percent identity is being reported. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
"Percent (%) amino acid sequence similarity" is determined by doing the same calculation as for determining % amino acid sequence identity, but including conservative amino acid substitutions in addition to identical amino acids in the computation.</p><p num="p0022">A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid having similar properties such that the folding or activity of the protein is not significantly affected. Aromatic amino acids that can be substituted for each other are phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine; interchangeable hydrophobic amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine; interchangeable polar amino acids are glutamine and asparagine; interchangeable basic amino acids are arginine, lysine and histidine; interchangeable acidic amino acids are aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and interchangeable small amino acids are alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine and glycine.</p><p num="p0023">Alternatively, an alignment for nucleic acid sequences is provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2:482-489; database: European Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/MPsrch/; Smith and Waterman, 1981, J. of MolecBioL, 147:195- 197; Nicholas et al., 1998, "A Tutorial on Searching Sequence Databases and Sequence Scoring Methods" (www.psc.edu) and references cited therein.; W.R. Pearson, 1991, Genomics 11:635-650). This algorithm can be applied to amino acid sequences by using the scoring matrix developed by Dayhoff (Dayhoff: Atlas of Protem Sequences and Structure, M. O. Dayhoff ed., 5 suppl. 3:353-358, National Biomedical Research</p><p num="p0024">Foundation, Washington, D.C., USA), and normalized by Gribskov (Gribskov 1986 Nucl. Acids Res. 14(6):6745-6763). The Smith-Waterman algorithm may be employed where default parameters are used for scoring (for example, gap open penalty of 12, gap extension penalty of two). From the data generated, the "Match" value reflects "sequence identity."</p><p num="p0025">Derivative nucleic acid molecules of the subject nucleic acid molecules include sequences that hybridize to the nucleic acid sequence of an HM. The stringency of hybridization can be controlled by temperature, ionic strength, pH, and the presence of denaturing agents such as formamide during hybridization and washing. Conditions routinely used are set out in readily available procedure texts (e.g., Current Protocol in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, Chap. 2.10, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Publishers (1994); Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor (1989)). In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention is capable of hybridizing to a nucleic acid molecule containing the nucleotide sequence of an HM under stringent hybridization conditions that

HM nucleic acids and derivatives and orthologs thereof may be obtained using any available method. For instance, techniques for isolating cDNA or genomic DNA sequences of interest by screening DNA libraries or by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are well known in the art. In general, the particular use for the protein will dictate the particulars of expression, production, and purification methods. For instance, production of proteins for use in screening for modulating agents may require methods that preserve specific biological activities of these proteins, whereas production of proteins for antibody generation may require structural integrity of particular epitopes. Expression of proteins to be purified for screening or antibody production may require the addition of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
specific tags (e.g., generation of fusion proteins). Overexpression of an HM protein for assays used to assess HM function, such as involvement in cell cycle regulation or hypoxic response, may require expression in eukaryotic cell lines capable of these cellular activities. Techniques for the expression, production, and purification of proteins are well known in the art; any suitable means therefore may be used (e.g., Higgins SJ and Hames BD (eds.) Protein Expression: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press Inc., New York 1999; Stanbury PF et al., Principles of Fermentation Technology, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, Elsevier Science, New York, 1995; Doonan S (ed.) Protein Purification Protocols, Humana Press, New Jersey, 1996; Coligan JE et al, Current Protocols in Protein Science (eds.), 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). In particular embodiments, recombinant HM is expressed in a cell line known to have defective p53 function (e.g. SAOS-2 osteoblasts, H1299 lung cancer cells, C33A and HT3 cervical cancer cells, HT-29 and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, among others, available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). The recombinant cells are used in cell-based screening assay systems of the invention, as described further below.</p><p num="p0030">The nucleotide sequence encoding an HM polypeptide can be inserted into any appropriate expression vector. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals, including promoter/enhancer element, can derive from the native HM gene and/or its flanking regions or can be heterologous. A variety of host- vector expression systems may be utilized, such as mammalian cell systems infected with virus (e.g. vaccinia virus, adenovirus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with virus (e.g. baculovirus); microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors, or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA. A host cell strain that modulates the expression of, modifies, and/or specifically processes the gene product may be used. To detect expression of the HM gene product, the expression vector can comprise a promoter operably linked to an HM gene nucleic acid, one or more origins of replication, and, one or more selectable markers (e.g. thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, etc.). Alternatively, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying for the expression of the HM gene product based on the physical or functional properties of the HM protein in in vitro assay systems (e.g. immunoassays).</p><p num="p0031">The HM protein, fragment, or derivative may be optionally expressed as a fusion, or chimeric protein product (i.e. it is joined via a peptide bond to a heterologous protein sequence of a different protein), for example to facilitate purification or detection. A chimeric product can be made by ligating the appropriate nucleic acid sequences encoding

the desired amino acid sequences to each other using standard methods and expressing the chimeric product. A chimeric product may also be made by protein synthetic techniques, e.g. by use of a peptide synthesizer (Hunkapiller et al, Nature (1984) 310:105-111).</p><p num="p0032">Once a recombinant cell that expresses the HM gene sequence is identified, the gene product can be isolated and purified using standard methods (e.g. ion exchange, affinity, and gel exclusion chromatography; centrifugation; differential solubility; electrophoresis, cite purification reference). Alternatively, native HM proteins can be purified from natural sources, by standard methods (e.g. immunoaffinity purification). Once a protein is obtained, it may be quantified and its activity measured by appropriate methods, such as immunoassay, bioassay, or other measurements of physical properties, such as crystallography.</p><p num="p0033">The methods of this invention may also use cells that have been engineered for altered expression (mis-expression) of HM or other genes associated with the p53 pathway.

The genetically modified animal may additionally have altered p53 expression (e.g. p53 knockout). Preferred genetically modified animals are mammals such as primates, rodents (preferably mice), cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs and cats. Preferred non-mammalian species include zebrafish, C. elegans, and Drosophila. Preferred genetically modified animals are transgenic animals having a heterologous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element in a portion of its cells, i.e. mosaic animals (see, for example, techniques described by Jakobovits, 1994, Curr. Biol. 4:761-763.) or stably integrated into its germ line DNA (i.e., in the genomic sequence of most or all of its cells). Heterologous nucleic acid is introduced into the germ line of such transgenic animals by genetic manipulation of, for example, embryos or embryonic stem cells of the host animal.

J. Robertson, ed., IRL Press (1987)). Clones of the nonhuman transgenic animals can be produced according to available methods (see Wilmut, I. et al (1997) Nature 385:810-813; and PCT International Publication Nos. WO 97/07668 and WO 97/07669).</p><p num="p0038">In one embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-out" animal having a heterozygous or homozygous alteration in the sequence of an endogenous HM gene that results in a decrease of HM function, preferably such that HM expression is undetectable or insignificant. Knock-out animals are typically generated by homologous recombination with a vector comprising a transgene having at least a portion of the gene to be knocked out. Typically a deletion, addition or substitution has been introduced into the transgene to functionally disrupt it. The transgene can be a human gene (e.g., from a human genomic clone) but more preferably is an ortholog of the human gene derived from the transgenic host species. For example, a mouse HM gene is used to construct a homologous recombination vector suitable for altering an endogenous HM gene in the mouse genome. Detailed methodologies for homologous recombination in mice are available (see Capecchi, Science (1989) 244:1288-1292; Joyner et al, Nature (1989)</p><p num="p0039">338:153-156). Procedures for the production of non-rodent transgenic mammals and other animals are also available (Houdebine and Chourrout, supra; Pursel etal, Science (1989) 244:1281-1288; Simms et al, Bio/Technology (1988) 6:179-183). In a preferred embodiment, knock-out animals, such as mice harboring a knockout of a specific gene, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
may be used to produce antibodies against the human counterpart of the gene that has been knocked out (Claesson MH et al., (1994) Scan J Immunol 40:257-264; DeclerckPJ et al., (1995) J Biol Chem. 270:8397-400).</p><p num="p0040">In another embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-in" animal having an alteration in its genome that results in altered expression (e.g., increased (including ectopic) or decreased expression) of the HM gene, e.g., by introduction of additional copies of HM, or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for altered expression of an endogenous copy of the HM gene. Such regulatory sequences include inducible, tissue-specific, and constitutive promoters and enhancer elements. The knock- in can be homozygous or heterozygous.</p><p num="p0041">Transgenic nonhuman animals can also be produced that contain selected systems allowing for regulated expression of the transgene. One example of such a system that may be produced is the cre/loxP recombinase system of bacteriophage PI (Lakso et al, PNAS (1992) 89:6232-6236; U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,317). If a cre/loxP recombinase system is used to regulate expression of the transgene, animals containing transgenes encoding both the Cre recombinase and a selected protein are required. Such animals can be provided through the construction of "double" transgenic animals, e.g., by mating two transgenic animals, one containing a transgene encoding a selected protein and the other containing a transgene encoding a recombinase. Another example of a recombinase system is the FLP recombinase system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (O'Gorman et al. (1991) Science 251:1351-1355; U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,182). In a preferred embodiment, both Cre-LoxP and Flp-Frt are used in the same system to regulate expression of the transgene, and for sequential deletion of vector sequences in the same cell (Sun X et al (2000) Nat Genet 25:83-6). The genetically modified animals can be used in genetic studies to further elucidate the p53 pathway, as animal models of disease and disorders implicating defective p53 function, and for in vivo testing of candidate therapeutic agents, such as those identified in screens described below. The candidate therapeutic agents are administered to a genetically modified animal having altered HM function and phenotypic changes are compared with appropriate control animals such as genetically modified animals that receive placebo treatment, and/or animals with unaltered HM expression that receive candidate therapeutic agent.</p><p num="p0042">In addition to the above-described genetically modified animals having altered HM function, animal models having defective p53 function (and otherwise normal HM

function), can be used in the methods of the present invention. For example, a p53 knockout mouse can be used to assess, in vivo, the activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent identified in one of the in vitro assays described below. p53 knockout mice are described in the literature (Jacks et al, Nature 2001;410:1111-1116, 1043-1044; Donehower et al, supra). Preferably, the candidate p53 modulating agent when administered to a model system with cells defective in p53 function, produces a detectable phenotypic change in the model system indicating that the p53 function is restored, i.e., the cells exhibit normal cell cycle progression.</p><p num="p0043">Modulating Agents</p><p num="p0044">The invention provides methods to identify agents that interact with and/or modulate the function of HM and/or the p53 pathway. Such agents are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications associated with the p53 pathway, as well as in further analysis of the HM protein and its contribution to the p53 pathway. Accordingly, the invention also provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway comprising the step of specifically modulating HM activity by administering a HM-interacting or -modulating agent.</p><p num="p0045">In a preferred embodiment, HM-modulating agents inhibit or enhance HM activity or otherwise affect normal HM function, including transcription, protein expression, protein localization, and cellular or extra-cellular activity. In a further preferred embodiment, the candidate p53 pathway- modulating agent specifically modulates the function of the HM. The phrases "specific modulating agent", "specifically modulates", etc., are used herein to refer to modulating agents that directly bind to the HM polypeptide or nucleic acid, and preferably inhibit, enhance, or otherwise alter, the function of the HM. The term also encompasses modulating agents that alter the interaction of the HM with a binding partner or substrate (e.g. by binding to a binding partner of an HM, or to a protein/binding partner complex, and inhibiting function).</p><p num="p0046">Preferred HM-modulating agents include small molecule compounds; HM-interacting proteins, including antibodies and other biotherapeutics; and nucleic acid modulators such as antisense and RNA inhibitors. The modulating agents may be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions, for example, as compositions that may comprise other active ingredients, as in combination therapy, and/or suitable carriers or excipients.

 Small molecule modulators</p><p num="p0047">Small molecule modulators are preferred where the identified HM has enzymatic function, and/or contains protein interaction domains. Such HMs are represented, for example, in rows 1-23, 26-29, 33-35, 37, 43-66, and 70-115 of Table 1. Small molecules are often preferred to modulate function of proteins with enzymatic function, and/or containing protein interaction domains. Chemical agents, referred to in the art as "small molecule" compounds are typically organic, non-peptide molecules, having a molecular weight less than 10,000, preferably less than 5,000, more preferably less than 1,000, and most preferably less than 500. This class of modulators includes chemically synthesized molecules, for instance, compounds from combinatorial chemical libraries. Synthetic compounds may be rationally designed or identified based on known or inferred properties of the HM protein or may be identified by screening compound libraries. Alternative appropriate modulators of this class are natural products, particularly secondary metabolites from organisms such as plants or fungi, which can also be identified by screening compound libraries for HM-modulating activity. Methods for generating and obtaining compounds are well known in the art (Schreiber SL, Science (2000) 151: 1964-1969; Radmann J and Gunther J, Science (2000) 151:1947-1948).</p><p num="p0048">Small molecule modulators identified from screening assays, as described below, can be used as lead compounds from which candidate clinical compounds may be designed, optimized, and synthesized.

Yeast two- hybrid and variant screens offer preferred methods for identifying endogenous HM- interacting proteins (Finley, R. L. et al.

Preferably the antibody is specific to a mammalian ortholog of HM polypeptide, and more preferably, to human HM. Antibodies may be polyclonal, monoclonal (mAbs), humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab').sub.2 fragments, fragments produced by a FAb expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. Epitopes of HM which are particularly antigenic can be selected, for example, by routine screening of HM polypeptides for antigenicity or by applying a theoretical method for selecting antigenic regions of a protein (Hopp and Wood (1981), Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-28; Hopp and Wood, (1983) Mol. Immunol. 20:483-89; Sutcliffe et al., (1983) Science 219:660-66) to the amino acid sequence of an HM. Monoclonal antibodies with affinities of 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>"1</sup> preferably IO<sup>9</sup> M<sup>"1</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>'1</sup>, or stronger can be made by standard procedures as described (Harlow and Lane, supra; Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice (2d ed) Academic Press, New York; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,381,292; 4,451,570; and 4,618,577). Antibodies may be generated against crude cell extracts of HM or substantially purified fragments thereof. If HM fragments are used, they preferably comprise at least 10, and more preferably, at least 20 contiguous amino acids of an HM protein. In a particular embodiment, HM-specific antigens and/or immunogens are coupled to carrier proteins that stimulate the immune response. For example, the subject polypeptides are covalently coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier, and the conjugate is emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, which enhances the immune response. An appropriate immune system such as a laboratory rabbit or mouse is immunized according to conventional protocols.</p><p num="p0057">The presence of HM-specific antibodies is assayed by an appropriate assay such as a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using immobilized corresponding HM polypeptides. Other assays, such as radioimmunoassays or fluorescent assays might also be used. Chimeric antibodies specific to HM polypeptides can be made that contain different portions from different animal species. For instance, a human immunoglobulin constant region may be linked to a variable region of a murine mAb, such that the antibody derives its biological activity from the human antibody, and its binding specificity from the murine fragment. Chimeric antibodies are produced by splicing together genes that

encode the appropriate regions from each species (Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

Humanized antibodies, which are a form of chimeric antibodies, can be generated by grafting complementary-determining regions (CDRs) (Carlos, T. M., J. M. Harlan. 1994. Blood 84:2068-2101) of mouse antibodies into a background of human framework regions and constant regions by recombinant DNA technology (Riechmann LM, et al., 1988 Nature 323: 323-327). Humanized antibodies contain -10% murine sequences and -90% human sequences, and thus further reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, while retaining the antibody specificities (Co MS, and Queen C. 1991 Nature 351: 501-501; Morrison SL. 1992 Ann.

Preferred nucleic acid modulators interfere with the function of the HM nucleic acid such as DNA replication, transcription, translocation of the HM RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the HM RNA, splicing of the HM RNA to yield one or more mRNA species, or catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the HM RNA. All HM proteins may be targeted by nucleic acid modulators, but preferred targets include transcription factors and cytoplasmic proteins. Thus, all HMs on Table 1, for example, can be targets for nucleic acid modulators.</p><p num="p0069">In one embodiment, the antisense oligomer is an oligonucleotide that is sufficiently complementary to an HM mRNA to bind to and prevent translation, preferably by binding to the 5' untranslated region.

Nucleic acid modulators are commonly used as research reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite specificity, are often used to elucidate the function of particular genes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,790). Nucleic acid modulators are also used, for example, to distinguish between functions of various members of a biological pathway. For example, antisense oligomers have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals and man and have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials to be safe and effective (Milligan JF, et al, Current Concepts in Antisense Drug Design, J Med Chem. (1993) 36:1923-1937; Tonkinson JL et al, Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides as Clinical Therapeutic Agents, Cancer Invest. (1996) 14:54-65). Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, an HM-specific nucleic acid modulator is used in an assay to further elucidate the role of the HM in the p53 pathway, and/or its relationship to other members of the pathway.

 In a preferred embodiment, the screening method comprises contacting a suitable assay system comprising an HM polypeptide with a candidate agent under conditions whereby, but for the presence of the agent, the system provides a reference activity (e.g. kinase activity), which is based on the particular molecular event the screening method detects. A statistically significant difference between the agent-biased activity and the reference activity indicates that the candidate agent modulates HM activity, and hence the p53 pathway.</p><p num="p0075">Primary Assays The type of modulator tested generally determines the type of primary assay.</p><p num="p0076">Primary assays for small molecule modulators</p><p num="p0077">For small molecule modulators, screening assays are used to identify candidate modulators. Screening assays may be cell-based or may use a cell-free system that recreates or retains the relevant biochemical reaction of the target protein (reviewed in Sittampalam GS et al, Curr Opin Chem Biol (1997) 1:384-91 and accompanying references). As used herein the term "cell-based" refers to assays using live cells, dead cells, or a particular cellular fraction, such as a membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondrial fraction. The term "cell free" encompasses assays using substantially purified protein (either endogenous or recombinantly produced), partially purified or crude cellular extracts. Screening assays may detect a variety of molecular events, including protein-DNA interactions, protein-protein interactions (e.g., receptor-ligand binding), transcriptional activity (e.g., using a reporter gene), enzymatic activity (e.g., via a property of the substrate), activity of second messengers, immunogenicty and changes in cellular morphology or other cellular characteristics.

protein complexes. In certain applications, when HM-interacting proteins are used in screens to identify small molecule modulators, the binding specificity of the interacting protem to the HM protein may be assayed by various known methods such as substrate processing (e.g. ability of the candidate HM-specific binding agents to function as negative effectors in HM-expressing cells), binding equilibrium constants (usually at least about 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, preferably at least about 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, more preferably at least about 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>), and immunogenicity (e.g. ability to elicit HM specific antibody in a heterologous host such as a mouse, rat, goat or rabbit). For enzymes and receptors, binding may be assayed by, respectively, substrate and ligand processing. The screening assay may measure a candidate agent's ability to specifically bind to or modulate activity of a HM polypeptide, a fusion protein thereof, or to cells or membranes bearing the polypeptide or fusion protein. The HM polypeptide can be full length or a fragment thereof that retains functional HM activity. The HM polypeptide may be fused to another polypeptide, such as a peptide tag for detection or anchoring, or to another tag. The HM polypeptide is preferably human HM, or is an ortholog or derivative thereof as described above. In a preferred embodiment, the screening assay detects candidate agent- based modulation of HM interaction with a binding target, such as an endogenous or exogenous protem or other substrate that has HM -specific binding activity, and can be used to assess normal HM gene function. Suitable assay formats that may be adapted to screen for HM modulators are known in the art. Preferred screening assays are high throughput or ultra high throughput and thus provide automated, cost-effective means of screening compound libraries for lead compounds (Fernandes PB, Curr Opin Chem Biol (1998) 2:597-603; Sundberg SA, Curr Opin Biotechnol 2000, 11:47-53). In one preferred embodiment, screening assays uses fluorescence technologies, including fluorescence polarization, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. These systems offer means to monitor protein-protein or DNA-protein interactions in which the intensity of the signal emitted from dye-labeled molecules depends upon their interactions with partner molecules (e.g., Selvin PR, Nat Struct Biol (2000) 7:730-4; Fernandes PB, supra; Hertzberg RP and Pope AJ, Curr Opin Chem Biol (2000) 4:445-451).</p><p num="p0079">A variety of suitable assay systems may be used to identify candidate HM and p53 pathway modulators (e.g. U.S. Pat.

WO 01/25487 (Helicase assays), U.S. Pat. No. 6,114,132 (phosphatase and protease assays), among others). Specific preferred assays are described in more detail below. As seen from Table 1, preferred HMs are enzymes or soluble proteins with ligand binding sites, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, proteases, protease inhibitors, helicases, polymerases, prolylisomerases, hydrolases, reductases, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), a range of metabolic enzymes, proteins involved in ubiquitination, DNA methylation and metabolism, RNA processing or binding, and adapters, among others. Alternative preferred targets are membrane proteins, such as G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), protein kinase receptors, transporters, and ligand-gated ion channels, among others. Protein kinases, key signal transduction proteins that may be either membrane- associated or intracellular, catalyze the transfer of gamma phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a serine, threonine or tyrosine residue in a protein substrate. Radioassays, which monitor the transfer from [gamma- P or - P] ATP, are frequently used to assay kinase activity. For instance, a scintillation assay for p56 (lck) kinase activity monitors the transfer of the gamma phosphate from [gamma -<sup>33</sup>P] ATP to a biotinylated peptide substrate. The substrate is captured on a streptavidin coated bead that transmits the signal (Beveridge M et al., J Biomol Screen (2000) 5:205-212). This assay uses the scintillation proximity assay (SPA), in which only radio-ligand bound to receptors tethered to the surface of an SPA bead are detected by the scintillant immobilized within it, allowing binding to be measured without separation of bound from free ligand. Other assays for protein kinase activity may use antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated substrates. For instance, the kinase receptor activation (KIRA) assay measures receptor tyrosine kinase activity by ligand stimulating the intact receptor in cultured cells, then capturing solubilized receptor with specific antibodies and quantifying phosphorylation via phosphotyrosine ELISA (Sadick MD, Dev Biol Stand (1999) 97:121- 133). Another example of antibody based assays for protein kinase activity is TRF (time- resolved fluorometry). This method utilizes europium chelate-labeled anti- phosphotyrosine antibodies to detect phosphate transfer to a polymeric substrate coated onto microtiter plate wells. The amount of phosphorylation is then detected using time- resolved, dissociation-enhanced fluorescence (Braunwalder AF, et al, Anal Biochem 1996 Jul l;238(2):159-64).</p><p num="p0080">Protein phosophatases catalyze the removal of a gamma phosphate from a serine, threonine or tyrosine residue in a protein substrate.

to kinases, appropriate assays measure the same parameters as kinase assays. In one example, the dephosphorylation of a fluorescently labeled peptide substrate allows trypsin cleavage of the substrate, which in turn renders the cleaved substrate significantly more fluorescent (Nishikata M et al, Biochem J (1999) 343:35-391). In another example, fluorescence polarization (FP), a solution-based, homogeneous technique requiring no immobilization or separation of reaction components, is used to develop high throughput screening (HTS) assays for protein phosphatases. This assay uses direct binding of the phosphatase with the target, and increasing concentrations of target- phosphatase increase the rate of dephosphorylation, leading to a change in polarization (Parker GJ et al., (2000) J Biomol Screen 5:77-88).</p><p num="p0081">Proteases are enzymes that cleave protein substrates at specific sites. Exemplary assays detect the alterations in the spectral properties of an artificial substrate that occur upon protease-mediated cleavage. In one example, synthetic caspase substrates containing four amino acid proteolysis recognition sequences, separating two different fluorescent tags are employed; fluorescence resonance energy transfer detects the proximity of these fluorophores, which indicates whether the substrate is cleaved (Mahajan NP et al, Chem Biol (1999) 6:401-409).</p><p num="p0082">Endogenous protease inhibitors may inhibit protease activity. In an example of an assay developed for either proteases or protease inhibitors, a biotinylated substrate is coated on a titer plate and hydrolyzed with the protease; the unhydrolyzed substrate is quantified by reaction with alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin complex and detection of the reaction product. The activity of protease inhibitors correlates with the activity of the alkaline phosophatase indicator enzyme (Gan Z et al, Anal Biochem 1999) 268:151-156). Helicases are involved in unwinding double stranded DNA and RNA. In one embodiment, an assay for DNA helicase activity detects the displacement of a radio- labeled oligonucleotide from single stranded DNA upon initiation of unwinding (Sivaraja M et al, Anal Biochem (1998) 265:22-27).

 Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) proteins, which include cyclophilins, FK506 binding proteins and paravulins, catalyze the isomerization of cis-trans proline peptide bonds in oligopeptides and are thought to be essential for protein folding during protein synthesis in the cell. Spectrophotometric assays for PPIase activity can detect isomerization of labeled peptide substrates, either by direct measurement of isomer- specific absorbance, or by coupling isomerization to isomer-specific cleavage by chymotrypsin (Scholz C et al., FEBS Lett (1997) 414:69-73; Janowski B et al, Anal Biochem (1997) 252:299-307; Kullertz G et al, Clin Chem (1998) 44:502-8).

(1981) Methods Enzymol. 71:403-411; Geisbrecht BV et al (1999) J Biol Chem. 274:21797- 803).

For instance, exemplary assays for SH2 domain- containing proteins have measured binding using fluorescently labeled peptide substrate and fluorescence polarization or laser-scanning techniques (Lynch BA et al., Anal Biochem 1999, 275:62-73; Zuck P et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1999, 96: 11122- 11127).

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large family of cell surface receptors that mediate a diverse array of biological functions. They selectively respond to a wide variety of extracellular chemical stimuli to activate specific signaling cascades. Assays may measure reporter gene activity or changes in intracellular calcium ions, or other second messengers (Durocher Y et al, Anal Biochem (2000) 284: 316-326; Miller TR et al, J Biomol Screen (1999) 4:249-258). Such assays may utilize chimeric Gα proteins that will couple to many different GPCRs and thus facilitate "universal" screening assays (Coward P et al, Anal Biochem (1999) 270:242-248; Milligan G and Rees S et al, Trends Pharmacol Sci (1999) 20:118-124).</p><p num="p0093">GPCRs exert their effects through heterotrimeric G proteins, which cycle between active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound forms. Receptors catalyze the activation of G proteins by promoting exchange of GDP for GTP, while G proteins catalyze their own deactivation through their intrinsic GTPase activity. GEFs accelerate GDP dissociation and GTP binding, while GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis to GDP. The same assays used to monitor GPCR activity may thus be applied to monitor the activity of GEFs or GAPs. Alternatively, GEF activity may be assayed by the release of labeled GDP from the appropriate GTPase or by the uptake of labelled GTP. GAP activity may be monitored via a GTP hydrolysis assay using labeled GTP (e.g., Jones S et al, Molec Biol Cell (1998) 9:2819-2837).

High throughput gel shift assays for transcription factors may involve fluorescence (Cyano dye Cy5) labeled oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes as specific probes and an automatic DNA sequencer for analysis (Ruscher K, et al., (2000) J Biotechnol 78:163-70). Alternatively high throughput methods involve colorimetric assays (Renard P, et al. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res 29(4):E21), or homogeneous fluorescence assays for the detection and quantification of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (Heyduk T, and HeydukE (2001) Nat Biotechnol 20:171-6.)</p><p num="p0096">Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors that mediate the effects of hormones and other endogenous ligands to regulate the expression of specific genes. High throughput assays for nuclear receptors include fluorescent polarization binding assays (Lin S, et al.

High throughput screening assays for reductases may involve scintillation (Fernandes PB. (1998) Curr Opin Chem Biol 2:597-603; Delaporte E et al. (2001) J Biomol Screen 6:225-231).</p><p num="p0098">Hydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of a substrate such as esterases, Upases, peptidases, nucleotidases, and phosphatases, among others. Enzyme activity assays may be used to

measure hydrolase activity. The activity of the enzyme is determined in presence of excess substrate, by spectrophotometrically measuring the rate of appearance of reaction products. High throughput arrays and assays for hydrolases are known to those skilled in the art (Park CB and Clark DS (2002) Biotech Bioeng 78:229-235). If an existent high-throughput assay is not available for a particular HM, its activity can be monitored using cell-based or cell-free methods. Since noncovalently associated multi-protein complexes mediate many biological processes, many effective chemical modulators will function by disrupting such complexes. If the HM belongs to a complex that is essential for protein function, appropriate assays may monitor complex formation or survival, instead of function per se. For instance, an appropriate cell-based assay is based on protein complementation, in which two proteins in a complex are fused to complementary fragments of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Enzyme activity of DHFR depends on proper folding of the two fragments, which in turn depends upon binding of the two complexed proteins. Two properties of DHFR can be assayed: DHFR confers viability to DHFR-negative pells in a cell survival assay, or DHFR binds a fluorescent substrate in a reporter assay (Remy I and Michnick SW, Proc Natl Acad Sci (1999) 96:5394-5399).</p><p num="p0099">Apoptosis assays. Assays for apoptosis may be performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-11-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The TUNEL assay is used to measure nuclear DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis ( Lazebnik et al, 1994, Nature 371, 346), by following the incorporation of fluorescein-dUTP (Yonehara et al, 1989, J. Exp. Med. 169, 1747). Apoptosis may further be assayed by acridine orange staining of tissue culture cells (Lucas, R., et al., 1998, Blood 15:4730-41). An apoptosis assay system may comprise a cell that expresses an HM, and that optionally has defective p53 function (e.g. p53 is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the apoptosis assay system and changes in induction of apoptosis relative to controls where no test agent is added, identify candidate p53 modulating agents. In some embodiments of the invention, an apoptosis assay may be used as a secondary assay to test a candidate p53 modulating agents that is initially identified using a cell-free assay system. An apoptosis assay may also be used to test whether HM function plays a direct role in apoptosis. For example, an apoptosis assay may be performed on cells that over- or under-express HM relative to wild type cells. Differences in apoptotic response compared to wild type cells suggests that the HM plays

Cell proliferation may be assayed via bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) incorporation. This assay identifies a cell population undergoing DNA synthesis by incorporation of BRDU into newly-synthesized DNA. Newly-synthesized DNA may then be detected using an anti-BRDU antibody (Hoshino et al., 1986, Int. J. Cancer 38, 369; Campana et al, 1988, J. Immunol. Meth. 107, 79), or by other means. Cell Proliferation may also be examined using [<sup>3</sup>H] -thymidine incorporation (Chen, J.,</p><p num="p0101">1996, Oncogene 13:1395-403; Jeoung, J., 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270:18367-73). This assay allows for quantitative characterization of S-phase DNA syntheses. In this assay, cells synthesizing DNA will incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine into newly synthesized DNA. Incorporation can then be measured by standard techniques such as by counting of radioisotope in a scintillation counter (e.g., Beckman LS 3800 Liquid Scintillation Counter).</p><p num="p0102">Cell proliferation may also be assayed by colony formation in soft agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor (1989)). For example, cells, transformed with HM are seeded in soft agar plates, and colonies are measured and counted after two weeks incubation.</p><p num="p0103">Involvement of a gene in the cell cycle may be assayed by flow cytometry (Gray JW et al. (1986) Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med 49:237-55). Cells transfected with an HM may be stained with propidium iodide and evaluated in a flow cytometer (available from Becton Dickinson). Accordingly, a cell proliferation or cell cycle assay system may comprise a cell that expresses an HM, and that optionally has defective p53 function (e.g. p53 is over- expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the assay system and changes in cell proliferation or cell cycle relative to controls where no test agent is added, identify candidate p53 modulating agents. In some embodiments of the invention, the cell proliferation or cell cycle assay may be used as a secondary assay to test a candidate p53 modulating agents that is initially identified using another assay system such as a cell-free assay system. A cell proliferation assay may also be used to test whether HM function plays a direct role in cell proliferation or cell cycle.

Angiogenesis may be assayed using various human endothelial cell systems, such as umbilical vein, coronary artery, or dermal cells. Suitable assays include Alamar Blue based assays (available from Biosource International) to measure proliferation; migration assays using fluorescent molecules, such as the use of Becton Dickinson Falcon HTS FluoroBlock cell culture inserts to measure migration of cells through membranes in presence or absence of angiogenesis enhancer or suppressors; and tubule formation assays based on the formation of tubular structures by endothelial cells on Matrigel® (Becton Dickinson). Accordingly, an angiogenesis assay system may comprise a cell that expresses an HM, and that optionally has defective p53 function (e.g. p53 is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the angiogenesis assay system and changes in angiogenesis relative to controls where no test agent is added, identify candidate p53 modulating agents. In some embodiments of the invention, the angiogenesis assay may be used as a secondary assay to test a candidate p53 modulating agents that is initially identified using another assay system. An angiogenesis assay may also be used to test whether HM function plays a direct role in cell proliferation. For example, an angiogenesis assay may be performed on cells that over- or under-express HM relative to wild type cells. Differences in angiogenesis compared to wild type cells suggests that the HM plays a direct role in angiogenesis.</p><p num="p0105">Hypoxic induction. The alpha subunit of the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), is upregulated in tumor cells following exposure to hypoxia in vitro. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 stimulates the expression of genes known to be important in tumour cell survival, such as those encoding glyolytic enzymes and VEGF. Induction of such genes by hypoxic conditions may be assayed by growing cells transfected with HM in hypoxic conditions (such as with 0.1% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2, generated in a Napco 7001 incubator (Precision Scientific)) and normoxic conditions, followed by assessment of gene activity or expression by Taqman®. For example, a hypoxic induction assay system may comprise a cell that expresses an HM, and that optionally has a mutated p53 (e.g. p53 is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the hypoxic induction assay system and

Cell adhesion assays measure adhesion of cells to purified adhesion proteins, or adhesion of cells to each other, in presence or absence of candidate modulating agents. Cell-protein adhesion assays measure the ability of agents to modulate the adhesion of cells to purified proteins. For example, recombinant proteins are produced, diluted to 2.5g/mL in PBS, and used to coat the wells of a microtiter plate. The wells used for negative control are not coated. Coated wells are then washed, blocked with 1% BSA, and washed again. Compounds are diluted to 2x final test concentration and added to the blocked, coated wells. Cells are then added to the wells, and the unbound cells are washed off. Retained cells are labeled directly on the plate by adding a membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, such as calcein-AM, and the signal is quantified in a fluorescent microplate reader.</p><p num="p0107">Cell-cell adhesion assays measure the ability of agents to modulate binding of cell adhesion proteins with their native ligands. These assays use cells that naturally or recombinantly express the adhesion protem of choice. In an exemplary assay, cells expressing the cell adhesion protein are plated in wells of a multiwell plate. Cells expressing the ligand are labeled with a membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, such as BCECF , and allowed to adhere to the monolayers in the presence of candidate agents. Unbound cells are washed off, and bound cells are detected using a fluorescence plate reader.</p><p num="p0108">High-throughput cell adhesion assays have also been described. In one such assay, small molecule ligands and peptides are bound to the surface of microscope slides using a microarray spotter, intact cells are then contacted with the slides, and unbound cells are washed off.

Methods for analyzing mRNA and protein expression are well known in the art. For instance, Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR (e.g., using the TaqMan®, PE Applied Biosystems), or microarray analysis may be used to confirm that HM mRNA expression is reduced in cells treated with the nucleic acid modulator (e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994) Ausubel FM et al, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chapter 4; Freeman WM et al, Biotechniques (1999) 26:112-125; Kallioniemi OP, Ann Med 2001, 33:142-147; Blohm DH and Guiseppi-Elie, A Curr Opin Biotechnol 2001, 12:41-47). Protein expression may also be monitored. Proteins are most commonly detected with specific antibodies or antisera directed against either the HM protein or specific peptides.

 The discovery that HM is implicated in p53 pathway provides for a variety of methods that can be employed for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of diseases and disorders involving defects in the p53 pathway and for the identification of subjects having a predisposition to such diseases and disorders. Various expression analysis methods can be used to diagnose whether HM expression occurs in a particular sample, including Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR, and microarray analysis, (e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994) Ausubel FM et al, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chapter 4; Freeman WM et al, Biotechniques (1999) 26:112-125; Kallioniemi OP, Ann Med 2001, 33:142-147; Blohm and Guiseppi-Elie, Curr Opin Biotechnol 2001, 12:41-47). Tissues having a disease or disorder implicating defective p53 signaling that express an HM, are identified as amenable to treatment with an HM modulating agent. In a preferred application, the p53 defective tissue overexpresses an HM relative to normal tissue. For example, a Northern blot analysis of mRNA from tumor and normal cell lines, or from tumor and matching normal tissue samples from the same patient, using full or partial HM cDNA sequences as probes, can determine whether particular tumors express or overexpress HM. Alternatively, the TaqMan® is used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of HM expression in cell lines, normal tissues and tumor samples (PE Applied Biosystems). Various other diagnostic methods may be performed, for example, utilizing reagents such as the HM oligonucleotides, and antibodies directed against an HM, as described above for: (1) the detection of the presence of HM gene mutations, or the detection of either over- or under-expression of HM mRNA relative to the non-disorder state; (2) the detection of either an over- or an under-abundance of HM gene product relative to the non-disorder state; and (3) the detection of perturbations or abnormalities in the signal transduction pathway mediated by HM.</p><p num="p0124">Thus, in a specific embodiment, the invention is drawn to a method for diagnosing a disease in a patient, the method comprismg: a) obtaining a biological sample from the patient; b) contacting the sample with a probe for HM expression; c) comparing results from step (b) with a control; and d) determining whether step (c) indicates a likelihood of disease.

Single stranded cDNA was then synthesized by reverse transcribing the RNA samples using random hexamers and 500ng of total RNA per reaction, following protocol 4304965 of Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, http://www.appliedbiosvstems.com/ ).</p><p num="p0142">Primers for expression analysis using TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were prepared according to the TaqMan protocols, and the following criteria: a) primer pairs were designed to span introns to eliminate genomic contamination, and b) each primer pair produced only one product.</p><p num="p0143">Taqman reactions were carried out following manufacturer's protocols, in 25 μl total volume for 96-well plates and 10 μl total volume for 384-well plates, using 300nM primer and 250 nM probe, and approximately 25ng of cDNA. The standard curve for result analysis was prepared using a universal pool ofhuman cDNA samples, which is a mixture of cDNAs from a wide variety of tissues so that the chance that a target will be present in appreciable amounts is good. The raw data were normalized using 18S rRNA (universally expressed in all tissues and cells). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="41"/>-->
 For each expression analysis, tumor tissue samples were compared with matched normal tissues from the same patient. A gene was considered overexpressed in a tumor when the level of expression of the gene was 2 fold or higher in the tumor compared with its matched normal sample. In cases where normal tissue was not available, a universal pool of cDNA samples was used instead. In these cases, a gene was considered overexpressed in a tumor sample when the difference of expression levels between a tumor sample and the average of all normal samples from the same tissue type was greater than 2 times the standard deviation of all normal samples (i.e., Tumor - average(all normal samples) &gt; 2 x STDEV(all normal samples) ). Results are shown in Table 2. Data presented in bold indicate that greater than 50% of tested tumor samples of the tissue type indicated in row 1 exhibited over expression of the gene listed in column 1, relative to normal samples. Underlined data indicates that between 25% to 49% of tested tumor samples exhibited over expression. A modulator identified by an assay described herein can be further validated for therapeutic effect by administration to a tumor in which the gene is overexpressed. A decrease in tumor growth confirms therapeutic utility of the modulator. Prior to treating a patient with the modulator, the likelihood that the patient will respond to treatment can be diagnosed by obtaining a tumor sample from the patient, and assaying for expression of the gene targeted by the modulator. The expression data for the gene(s) can also be used as a diagnostic marker for disease progression. The assay can be performed by expression analysis as described above, by antibody directed to the gene target, or by any other available detection method.
