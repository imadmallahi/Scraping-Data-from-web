Conventional aqueous emulsion based pressure sensitive adhesives are comprised of a copolymer comprised of polymerized units of acrylic esters and ethylenically unsaturated monomers, the copolymer having a T.sub.g of from -15 to -70 improvement in the aqueous based, emulsion polymerized pressure sensitive adhesives resides in the incorporation of a vinyl ester of a C.sub.8-13 neo-acid into the copolymers present in the pressure sensitive adhesives. Such copolymers incorporate a vinyl ester formed from a mixture of propylene oligomers and such vinyl ester is represented by the chemical formula:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->C.sub.8-13 H.sub.17-27 CO.sub.2 CH═CH.sub.2</pre></p><p>There are significant advantages associated with the above aqueous based pressure sensitive adhesive emulsions and the process for producing these emulsions and these advantages include:</p><p>an ability to provide enhanced properties to pressure sensitive adhesives through the methyl group rich vinyl ester mixture which exhibits a lower solubility parameter compared to the corresponding linear alkyl vinyl esters;</p><p>an ability to provide enhanced properties to pressure sensitive adhesives through the ability of the vinyl ester monomer to undergo emulsion polymerization with a variety of olefinically unsaturated comonomers;</p><p>an ability to form an excellent bond and enhanced resistance to plasticizer migration with plasticized poly(vinyl chloride);</p><p>an ability to generate a class of pressure sensitive adhesives which have an excellent balance of peel and cohesive strength;</p><p>an ability to provide enhanced thermal and hydrolytic stability to emulsion based pressure sensitive adhesives as compared to aqueous based vinyl acetate counterparts; and,</p><p>an ability to provide enhanced properties to pressure sensitive adhesives through binding to lower surface energy surfaces of lower polarity, such as polyethylene, by virtue of stronger bonding of the copolymers</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Emulsion polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as lower alkyl acrylates and vinyl esters, typically represented by vinyl acetate or vinyl propionate, to produce aqueous based pressure sensitive adhesive emulsions containing vinyl copolymer is well known. The improvement to emulsion based pressure sensitive adhesives containing vinyl copolymer incorporating polymerized units of ethylenically unsaturated monomer units resides in the incorporation of a vinyl ester of a neo-acid derived from a propylene oligomer feedstock into the vinyl copolymer.</p><p>The vinyl ester of a neo-acid of propylene oligomers or mixture thereof is incorporated into the vinyl polymer is comprised of the vinyl ester of a single or mixture of tri- and tetramers of propylene which have been converted to the corresponding single or mixture of C.sub.8-13 neo-acids. These esters typically are prepared by first converting the tri and tetramers of propylene to the corresponding acids and then converting the corresponding those neo-acids to the vinyl esters. The vinylation of those acids can be achieved either by transvinylation with vinyl acetate or by catalytic addition of the neo-acids to acetylene. Some of the vinyl esters may be represented by a singular neo-acid, but generally the vinyl esters of the neo-acids are present as a mixture.</p><p>Aqueous based pressure sensitive adhesive emulsions are based on emulsions which comprise a colloidal dispersion of the vinyl copolymer in water. The copolymers present in the pressure sensitive adhesives are typically derived from the following monomers and within the percentage proportions listed below:</p><p>(a) 5-40 wt % of a vinyl ester of a C.sub.8-13 neo-acid, preferably 15 to 30 wt %;</p><p>(b) 30-80 wt % of a C.sub.1-12 alkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid, preferably 40 to 70 wt %,</p><p>(c) 0-20% wt % of a vinyl ester of saturated aliphatic acids, preferably 0 to 10%;</p><p>(d) 0-30 wt % ethylene, styrene or butadiene, preferably 0 to 20 wt %;</p><p>(e) 0-20 wt % di-(C.sub.1-13)alkyl maleate/fumarate, preferably 0 to 10 wt %;</p><p>(f) 0-5 wt % of a hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate;</p><p>(g) 0-5 wt % (meth)acrylamide; and,</p><p>(h) 0-10 wt % alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid.</p><p>A variety of other comonomers, e.g., other ethylenically unsaturated monomers sometimes employed in the formation of the aqueous based pressure sensitive emulsions can be copolymerized with the vinyl ester of a neo-acid to form adhesives. For example, C.sub.1-8 alkyl vinyl ethers, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, nitriles, carboxylic amides such as N-vinylformamide and N-vinylacetamide, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile to produce a variety of polymers. Examples of useful alkyl vinyl ethers are methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, isopropyl vinyl ether, n-propyl vinyl ether, tert-butyl vinyl ether and n- and isobutyl vinyl ether.</p><p>Component (a) monomers which are the vinyl esters of C.sub.8-13 neo-acids and utilized in producing the improved pressure sensitive adhesives have been defined.</p><p>Component (b) monomers utilized in producing the pressure sensitive adhesives containing the vinyl esters of C.sub.8-13 neo-acids are alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid. These are esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and a C.sub.1-12 alcohol. Examples of suitable alcohols for the preparation of these esters are methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n-, iso- and tert-butyl alcohol, neopentyl alcohol, 2-ethyl-hexanol, n-octanol, dodecanol, palmityl alcohol and stearyl alcohol. Specific examples of unsaturated alkyl acrylate monomers include methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, isooctyl acrylate, isodecyl acrylate and the like.</p><p>Component (c) monomers which may be used in forming emulsion polymers for pressure sensitive adhesives can include other vinyl esters than the vinyl esters of neo-acids. Some of the more common vinyl esters used in the polymer synthesis include C.sub.3-18 alkanoic acids, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl laurate and the like. These esters, and particularly the lower alkyl esters, may detract from the overall properties of the pressure sensitive emulsion imparted by the vinyl ester of the C.sub.8-13 neo-acids.</p><p>Component (d) monomers used as a fraction of the polymers utilized in forming emulsion polymers for pressure sensitive adhesives can include hydrocarbon monomers such as ethylene, styrene, butadiene.</p><p>Component (e) monomers used in forming many of the pressure sensitive adhesives include an alkyl maleate or fumarate, for the purpose of providing enhanced tack. etc. One may suitably use the diesters of maleic acid or fumaric acid, the diester being formed by the reaction of the acid with a C.sub.1-13, such as, n-octyl alcohol, isooctyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, amyl alcohol and the like. Preferably a C.sub.4-8, alcohol is employed.</p><p>Components (f) monomers often are incorporated into the pressure sensitive adhesive polymer. Representative monomers include hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylates, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylates, hydroxypropyl methacrylates, hydroxybutyl acrylates and hydroxybutyl methacrylates.</p><p>Component (g) monomers often are incorporated into the copolymers at some levels. Examples of amides include acrylamide, methacrylamide and N-methylol-acrylamide.</p><p>Component (h) monomers include the alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated C.sub.3-6 carboxylic acids which can be incorporated into the polymer can be methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, acrylic acid and the like.</p><p>The sum of the monomers used to form the pressure sensitive copolymers is 100 percent. The emulsion copolymers are designed to have a T.sub.g of less than -15 -20 to -50 solids.</p><p>The emulsion polymerization process typically involves an initial homogenization in which the monomers which include the vinyl esters of neo-acids and the other monomers which are employed to form the vinyl copolymer such as C.sub.1-12 alkyl acrylates or methacrylates, vinyl acetate, dialkyl maleate/fumarate, ethylene, acrylamide and other monomers are thoroughly agitated. If ethylene is added to the reactor to form a copolymer, the reactor is pressured to the working pressure to effect solution of the ethylene in the monomers. Then, the reaction medium is gradually heated to polymerization temperature. The homogenization period is followed by a polymerization period during which the free radical source is added incrementally.</p><p>Various free-radical forming catalysts such as peroxide compounds can be used in carrying out the emulsion polymerization of the monomers. Combination-type catalysts employing both reducing agents and oxidizing agents can also be used. The use of this type of combined catalyst is generally referred to in the art as "redox polymerization" or "redox system." The reducing agent is also often referred to as an activator and the oxidizing agent as an initiator. Suitable reducing agents or activators include bisulfites, sulfoxylates, or other compounds having reducing properties such as ferrous salts, and tertiary aromatic amines, e.g., N,N-dimethylaniline. The oxidizing agents or initiators include hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide and the like, persulfates, such as ammonium or potassium persulfate, perborates, and the like. A specific combination-type catalyst or redox system which can be used is hydrogen peroxide and sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate.</p><p>The initiator is employed in the amount of 0.1 to 2%, preferably 0.25 to 0.75%, based on the weight of monomers introduced into the reactor. The activator is ordinarily added as an aqueous solution and the amount of activator is generally from 0.25 to 1 times the amount of initiator.</p><p>A wide variety of nonionic, anionic and cationic surfactants can be used to stabilize the emulsion in emulsion polymerization processes. Suitable nonionic emulsifying agents include polyoxyethylene condensates. Polyoxyethylene condensates may be represented by the general formula:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->R(CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --O).sub.n H</pre></p><p>where R is the residue of a fatty alcohol containing 10-18 carbon atoms, an alkylphenol, a fatty acid containing from 10-18 carbon atoms, an amide, an amine, or a mercaptan, and where n is an integer of 1 or above. Some specific examples of polyoxyethylene condensates which can be used include polyoxyethylene aliphatic ethers such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether, polyoxyethylene hydroabietyl ether and the like; polyoxyethylene alkaryl ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether and the like; polyoxyethylene esters of higher fatty acids such as polyoxyethylene laurate, polyoxyethylene oleate and the like as well as condensates of ethylene oxide with resin acids and tall oil acids; polyoxyethylene amide and amine condensates such as N-polyoxyethylene lauramide, and N-lauryl-N-polyoxyethylene amine and the like; and polyoxyethylene thioethers such as polyoxyethylene n-dodecyl thioether. Other suitable nonionic surfactants are alkylarylethoxylate alcohols, alkylethoxylate alcohol, ethoxypropoxylate, alcohols from ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide reaction products, and the like.</p><p>Another class of nonionic surfactants are sold under the Igepal trademark. One example within this class is a polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether having a cloud point of between 126 and 133 the trade mark "Igepal CO-630"; another is polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether having a cloud point above 212 trade mark "Igepal CO-887."</p><p>Examples of anionic surfactants include metal or ammonium salts of long chain alkyl sulfates and the likes; metal or ammonium salts of alkylarylethoxylated sulfates or sulfonates, paraffin sulfonates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl phosphates, etc.</p><p>A protective colloid also can be used in the polymerization mixture as a stabilizing agent. Various colloids and amounts conventionally used in emulsion polymerization can be incorporated into the latices as desired and in combination with the surfactants. Representative colloids which can be used include poly(vinyl alcohol), partially-acetylated poly(vinyl alcohol), e.g., up to 50% acetylated, casein, hydroxyethyl starch, carboxymethylcellulose, gum arabic, and the like.</p><p>The concentration range of the total amount of emulsifying agents used in emulsion polymerization is from 0.1 to 10% based on the aqueous phase of the latex regardless of the solids content. The stabilizers employed are, in part, governed by the use to which the copolymer latex is to be put. By utilizing appropriate levels of surfactant and/or protective colloid, one can obtain latex polymer particles having a variety of average particle size ranges and distributions.</p><p>In order to maintain the pH of the system at the desired value, there is suitably added a buffering agent of any convenient type. Any alkaline material which is compatible with the stabilizing agent can be used as the buffer. The amount of buffer is that sufficient to adjust the pH of the system within the desired range, e.g., 2.5 to 10 and preferably 3.5 and 8.5. The amount of buffer is generally about 0.1 to 0.5% by weight, based on the monomers.</p><p>Reaction temperatures for emulsion polymerizing the vinyl esters of neo-acids along with other monomers are conventional. The reaction temperature can be controlled by the rate of catalyst addition and by the rate of the heat dissipation therefrom. Generally, it is advantageous to maintain a temperature from about 50 to 90 as low as 0 limit is about 40</p><p>The reaction time will also vary depending upon other variables such as the temperature, the catalyst, and the desired extent of the polymerization. It is generally desirable to continue the reaction until less than 0.1% of the vinyl ester remains unreacted. Under these circumstances, a reaction time of about 4 hours has been found to be generally sufficient for complete polymerization, but reaction times ranging from 2 to 10 hours have been used, and other reaction times can be employed, if desired.</p><p>The following examples are provided to illustrate various embodiments of the invention and are not intended to restrict the scope thereof.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading><heading>Preparation of Water Borne Pressure Sensitive Adhesives of Mixed Vinyl Neo-C.sub.8-13 Esters, 2-EHA, Methyl Methacrylate and Acrylic Acid</heading><p>The mixed vinyl neo-C.sub.8-13 esters employed in forming the pressure sensitive adhesive emulsions are formed from a propylene oligomer feedstock which is comprised predominately of propylene trimers and tetramers.</p><p>To a 2-liter resin reactor are added the following initial reaction mixture comprising 200 g of deionized water, 1.28 g of sodium citrate and 133 g of a pre-emulsion monomer mixture of the following composition:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________Deionized water     288.00  gAbex EP-120 (30% active)*               8.23    gIgepal CO-887 (70% active)               8.23    gAerosol MA-80 (80% active)               7.20    gVinyl neo-C.sub.8-13 ester monomer               144.00  g      25.0%*Methyl methacrylate 74.90   g      13.0%*2-Ethylhexyl acrylate               345.60  g      60.0%*Acrylic acid        11.52   g       2.0%*______________________________________ *Abex EP120 is the ammonium salt of an alkylphenol ethoxylated sulfate, *The percentage of each monomer listed is expressed by weight of the tota monomers employed to form the copolymer in the pressure sensitive adhesiv emulsion.</pre></p><p>The initial reaction mixture is heated to 80 150-200 rpm agitation.

Again, the higher T.sub.g of Example 4 had higher shear than the Example 3 product. Peel was noticeably effected but remained good relative to commercial systems. Example 5 shows the deleterious effect on cohesive strength when a higher, linear vinyl ester is substituted for the vinyl neo-C.sub.8-13 esters. Pressure sensitive adhesives incorporating ethylene had significantly lower shear as would be expected because of the softness imparted by the ethylene. However, with regard to comparable ethylene based pressure sensitive adhesives, those values are good. Example 8 shows that replacing up to 5% of the vinyl neo-C.sub.8-13 esters with a lower aliphatic vinyl ester, viz. vinyl acetate can adversely affect peel and loop tack.
