silica gels with high pore volume is disclosed. A
hydrophilic silica hydrogel, treated with an
organosilicon compound to effect hydrophobing of the
silica hydrogel, is heated in the presence of an
oxidizing atmosphere to a temperature sufficient to
reduce the hydrophobicity imparted by the surface
treatment, thereby producing a hydrophilic silica gel
having high pore volume.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention is a method for the
preparation of hydrophilic silica gels with high pore
volume. In the method, a hydrophilic silica hydrogel
is treated with an organosilicon compound in the
presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid to
effect hydrophobing of the silica hydrogel. Then, the
hydrophobic silica gel is heated in the presence of an
oxidizing atmosphere to a temperature sufficient to
reduce the hydrophobicity imparted by the surface
treatment thereby producing a more hydrophilic silica
gel having high pore volume.</p><p num="0002">Silica gels are typically prepared by wet
processes where, for example, a sodium silicate is
gelled either under acidic or neutral conditions
resulting in a three-dimensional network which
partially collapses upon drying unless special
precautions are taken to reduce or prevent such
collapse. By definition, gels from which the liquid
medium has been removed with the structure being
compressed and the porosity reduced at least to some
degree by the surface tension forces as the liquid is
removed are referred to as xerogels. Typically such
xerogels have surface areas within the range of 50 to
600 m<sup>2</sup>/g and pore volumes within a range of 0.5 to 1
ml/g. In order to obtain silica gels having higher
porosity, typically referred to as aerogels, it is
generally necessary to convert the hydrogel to an
organogel such as an alcogel and then heat the
organogel in an autoclave to above the critical point
of the liquid so that there is no liquid vapor 
interface, releasing the vapor and thereby avoiding
collapse or change in structure. Although this method
for producing aerogels can produce silica aerogels
having surface area and porosity greater than that
typically associated with xerogels, it is a costly
method and therefore has limited utility.</p><p num="0003">The present invention provides a convenient
method whereby a hydrophilic silica gel having high
porosity can be formed without resorting to procedures
such as those described above for making aerogels.</p><p num="0004">U.S. Patent 3,024,126 teaches a method for

is not critical to the present invention and can be any
of those methods known in the art. The silica
hydrogels useful in the present method can be prepared 
by methods such as those described, for example, in
U.S. Patents 3,122,520; 5,708,069; 5,789,514; 5,647,962
and 5,795,556, and include organosilicate modified
silica hydrogels such as described in U.S. Patents
5,789,495 and 5,807,501.</p><p num="0019">The silica hydrogel useful in the present
method may be prepared by first forming a silica
hydrosol comprising from 0.02 g to 0.5 g of SiO<sub>2</sub> per ml
and if desired 1 to 50 weight percent of an
organosilicate, such as sodium methyl silicate, based
on the weight of the hydrosol. The method used to
prepare the silica hydrosol is not critical and can be
any of those known in the art. The silica hydrosol may
be prepared, for example, by deionizing sodium silicate
by a method such as the use of an ion exchange resin.
Alternatively, the silica hydrosol may be prepared by
hydrolyzing a silane at a low temperature. Preferably,
the silica hydrosol is prepared by deionizing sodium
silicate.</p><p num="0020">The silica hydrogel may be formed from the
silica hydrosol under acid or neutral conditions, that
is within a pH range of pH 0 to pH 7. If the silica
hydrogel is to be formed under acid conditions, a
strong mineral acid can be added to the silica hydrosol
to effect formation of a silica hydrogel. Any strong
mineral acid can be used. As used herein, the term
"strong mineral acid" refers to those acids which
ionize to the extent of at least 25 percent in 0.1 N
aqueous solution at 18°C. The strong mineral acid may
be, for example, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, sulfuric,
nitric and phosphoric acid. If the silica hydrogel is
to be formed under neutral conditions, a base may be 
added to the silica hydrosol to effect formation of a
silica hydrogel. The base can be, for example, NaOH,
KOH and Na<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3.36</sub>.</p><p num="0021">The temperature at which the silica hydrogel
is formed can be within a range of 20°C. to 250°C.,
with a range of 75°C. to 150°C. being preferred, and a
range of 90°C. to 110°C. being most preferred</p><p num="0022">The time required for the silica hydrogel to
form varies with the temperature and pH of the silica
hydrosol, with the time required for the silica
hydrogel to form decreasing as the pH approaches the
limits of the described pH range. It is preferred that
the silica hydrosol and resulting hydrogel be heated at
a temperature and length of time such that the
resulting silica hydrogel has a structure such that the
product after the hydrophobing step has a surface area
in the dry state within a range of 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 1000
m<sup>2</sup>/g as determined by the Brunauer Emmett and Teller
(BET) method described in the Jour. Am. Chem. Soc.
60:309 (1938) and as further described in U.S. Patent
3,122,520. Generally, the surface area of the silica
hydrogel is reduced by the hydrophobing reaction, since
the organosilyl groups which become attached to the
surface of the silica hydrogel increase the average
particle size. The surface of the silica hydrogel can
be above 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g provided that the hydrophobing
treatment brings it within a range of 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 1000
m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p><p num="0023">Prior to use in the present method the silica
hydrogel may be aged by heating for a period of time at
a temperature within a range of 20°C. to 250°C. If the 
silica hydrogel is aged, a temperature of 75°C. to
150°C. is preferred. The length of time for such aging
can be within a range of from 5 minutes up to 24 hours
or longer. Generally, it is preferred that such aging
be for a period of time within a range of 30 minutes to
20 hours.</p><p num="0024">In step (A) of the present method, a silica
hydrogel is contacted with one or more of the organosilicon
compounds described by above formulas (1), (2)
and (3) in the presence of a catalytic amount of a
strong acid. In step (A), the strong acid can be the
same acid used in preparing the silica hydrogel, if
prepared under acid conditions. However, if desired,
the silica hydrogel can be washed free of acid and a
catalytic amount of strong acid added either prior to,
simultaneously with or subsequent to the addition of
the organosilicon compound. In the case where the
organosilicon compound is, for example, a chlorosilane,
the catalytic amount of the strong acid can be
generated in situ by hydrolysis of the chlorosilane or
the reaction of the chlorosilane directly with
hydroxyls of the silica hydrogel. In step (A), a
"catalytic amount of a strong acid" is any amount
sufficient to effect reaction of the organosilicon
compound with the silica hydrogel. Examples of useful
acids include hydrochloric, sulfuric and benzene
sulfonic. It is preferred that in step (A)the strong
acid catalyst provide a pH less than 2.5.</p><p num="0025">The temperature at which the hydrophobing of
step (A) is conducted is not critical and can be from
20°C. to 250°C. Generally, it is preferred that the
hydrophobing of step (A) be conducted at a temperature 
within a range of 30°C. to 150°C. The hydrophobing of
step (A) can be conducted at the reflux temperature of
the water-immiscible organic solvent when present.</p> <p num="0026">In step (A), the silica hydrogel is reacted
with an organosilicon compound described by formulas
(1), (2) and (3). In formulas (1), (2) and (3), each
R<sup>1</sup> can be independently selected from hydrocarbon
radicals comprising 1 to 12 carbon atoms and
organofunctional hydrocarbon radicals comprising 1 to
12 carbon atoms. R<sup>1</sup> can be a saturated or unsaturated
hydrocarbon radical. R<sup>1</sup> can be a substituted or non-substituted
hydrocarbon radical. R<sup>1</sup> can be, for
example, alkyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl, propyl,
tert-butyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl and dodecyl;
alkenyl radicals such as vinyl, allyl and hexenyl;
substituted alkyl radicals such as chloromethyl, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl
and 6-chlorohexyl; and aryl radicals
such as phenyl, naphthyl and tolyl. R<sup>1</sup> can be an
organofunctional hydrocarbon radical comprising 1 to 12
carbon atoms where, for example, the functionality is
mercapto, disulfide, polysulfide, amino, carboxylic
acid, carbinol, ester or amido. Preferred is when R<sup>1</sup>
is an alkyl radical, with methyl being most preferred.</p><p num="0027">In formula (1), each X is independently
selected from halogen and alkoxy radicals comprising 1
to 12 carbon atoms. When X is a halogen, it is
preferred that the halogen be chlorine. When X is an
alkoxy radical, X may be, for example, methoxy, ethoxy
and propoxy. Preferred is when X is a chlorine atom.</p><p num="0028">The viscosity of the organosiloxanes
described by formula (2) is not limiting and can range
from that of a fluid to a gum. Generally, higher 
molecular weight organosiloxanes will be cleaved by the
acidic conditions of the present method allowing them
to react with the silica hydrogel.</p><p num="0029">The organosilicon compound may be provided to
the present method as a single compound as described by
formulas (1), (2) and (3) or as a mixture of two or
more organosilicon compounds described by these
formulas.</p><p num="0030">Examples of useful organosilicon compounds
include diethyldichlorosilane, allylmethyldichlorosilane,
methylphenyldichlorosilane, phenylethyldiethoxysilane,
3,3,3-trifluoropropylmethyldichlorosilane,
trimethylbutoxysilane, sym-diphenyltetramethyldisiloxane,
trivinyltrimethylcyclotrisiloxane,
hexaethyldisiloxane, pentylmethyldichlorosilane,
divinyldipropoxysilane, vinyldimethylchlorosilane,
vinylmethyldichorosilane, vinyldimethylmethoxysilane,
trimethylchlorosilane, hexamethyldisiloxane,
hexenylmethyldichlorosilane, hexenyldimethylchlorosilane,
dimethylchlorosilane, dimethyldichorosilane,
mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, hexamethyldisilazane
and bis{3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl}tetrasulfide.
It is preferred that the organosilicon
compound be hexamethyldisiloxane or dimethyldichlorosilane.</p> <p num="0031">The amount of organosilicon compound added to
the method is that sufficient to adequately hydrophobe
the silica hydrogel to provide a hydrophobic silica gel
which substantially retains its porosity during any
subsequent drying, solvent exchange and heating 
procedures. Generally the organosilicon compound
should be added to the method in an amount such that
there is at least 0.04 organosilyl unit per SiO<sub>2</sub> unit
in the silica hydrogel. The upper limit of the amount
of organosilicon compound added to the process is not
critical since any amount in excess of the amount
required to saturate the silica gel will act as a
solvent for the method.</p> <p num="0032">During the conduct of step (A), it may be
desirable to add a surfactant or water-miscible solvent
to facilitate the reaction of the organosilicon
compound with the silica hydrogel. The surfactant or
water-miscible solvent may be added in the presence or
absence of any water-immiscible organic solvent added
to the method. Suitable surfactants can include, for
example, anionic surfactants such as dodecylbenzene
sulfonic acid, nonionic surfactants such as
polyoxylene(23)lauryl ether and
(Me<sub>3</sub>SiO)<sub>2</sub>MeSi(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>OMe where Me is methyl,
and cationic surfactants such as N-alkyltrimethyl
ammonium chloride. Suitable water miscible solvents
can include, for example, alcohols such as methanol,
ethanol, propanol, n-butanol and tetrahydrofuran. n-Propanol
is a preferred water-miscible solvent for use
in the present method.</p> <p num="0033">The hydrophobic silica gel formed in step (A)
may be treated in step (B) as is with no steps taken to
reduce the water content. Alternatively, the
hydrophobic silica gel may have a portion,
substantially all, or all of the water removed by such
methods as centrifugation or filtration and/or drying
by the use of methods such as heating or reducing 
pressure or a combination of both heating and reducing
pressure. By the term "substantially all", it is meant
that the silica gel contain less than 5 weight percent
water.</p><p num="0034">The organic solvent can be added prior to,
simultaneously with, or subsequent to the addition of
the organosilicon compound. That is the silica
hydrogel can be first converted into an organogel by
replacement of the water with the organic solvent. On
the other hand, the organosilicon compound and the
organic solvent can be added simultaneously to the
silica hydrogel. Under these conditions, the reaction
of the silica hydrogel with the organosilicon compound
and the replacement of the water in the silica hydrogel
with the organic solvent may occur simultaneously.
Finally the organosilicon compound can be added prior
to the organic solvent, in which case the silica
hydrogel reacts with the organosilicon compound and the
resulting product is then converted into an organogel
by an addition of an organic solvent. In the latter
two cases, the conversion to an organogel is
accomplished by a phase separation in which the
hydrophobic silica gel passes into the organic solvent
phase.</p><p num="0035">A preferred method is where a water-immiscible
organic solvent is added after formation of
the hydrophobic silica hydrogel thereby effecting
formation of a hydrophobic silica organogel and the
solvent is thereafter removed from the hydrophobic
silica organogel providing a substantially dry 
hydrophobic silica gel which is then treated in step
(B) of the present method to form the hydrophilic
silica gel.</p><p num="0036">For purposes of this invention, any organic
solvent immiscible with water can be employed.
Suitable solvents include low molecular weight
siloxanes such as hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane,
diphenyltetramethyldisiloxane and
trimethylsilyl endblocked dimethylpolysiloxane fluids.
When a siloxane is employed as a solvent, it may serve
both as a solvent and as a reactant with the silica
hydrogel. In addition, suitable solvents include
aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene;
heptane and other aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents;
cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane; ethers such as
diethylether and dibutylether; halohydrocarbon such as
methylene chloride, chloroform, ethylene chloride and
chlorobenzene; and ketones such as methylisobutylketone.</p><p num="0037">The amount of water-immiscible organic
solvent is not critical so long as there is sufficient
solvent to convert the silica hydrogel into a silica
organogel. Preferably the solvent should have a
boiling point below 250°C. to enhance its removal from
the hydrophobic silica organogel, however, the boiling
point is not critical since the solvent may be removed
from the hydrophobic silica organogel by centrifuging
or other suitable means.</p><p num="0038">In step (B) of the present method, the
hydrophobic silica gel is heated in the presence of an 
oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature sufficient to
reduce the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic silica
gel. By "oxidizing atmosphere", it is meant the
presence of oxygen or oxygen source sufficient to
reduce or prevent the formation of SiOC bonds during
the heating process. In a preferred process, the
heating is effected in the presence of oxygen which may
be supplied as a component of atmospheric air.
Generally, the temperature can be any temperature that
reduces the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic silica
gel without adversely effecting the structure of the
gel. All or a portion of the hydrophobicity imparted
to the silica gel by the treatment in step (A) may be
reduced by the heating of step (B). Typically, a
temperature within a range of 300°C. to 1000°C. may be
used, with a temperature within a range of 400°C. to
800°C. being preferred. The method for heating the
hydrophobic silica gel in step (B) is not critical and
can be by means of a flame, induction furnace and those
type apparatuses typically used in commercial calcining
operations of metal oxides.</p><p num="0039">Hydrophilic silica gels prepared by the
present method can have a BET surface area within a
range of 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g and a pore volume
greater than 2 ml/g. Preferred are those hydrophilic
silica gels in which substantially all of the
hydrophobicity imparted by the treatment in step (A) to
the silica hydrogel is removed by the heat treatment of
step (B), the hydrophilic silica gel has a BET surface
area within a range of 250 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 850 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and the
pore volume is within a range of 2 ml/g to 5 ml/g. </p><p num="0040">The following examples are provided to
illustrate the present invention. These examples are

of SiO<sub>2</sub>/ml was passed through a column filled with
Dowex 50WX8-100 ion exchange resin in the acid form
(The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI). The first 800
ml of the silica hydrosol eluting from the column was
discarded and the next 2 L of deionized silica hydrosol
collected. The 2 L of deionized silica hydrosol was
placed in a 5 L flask and with rapid stirring 626 ml of
concentrated HCl was added to the flask. A silica gel
formed within a few minutes which was broken up by
stirring. The flask content was heated at 100°C. for 3
hours and then cooled to 40°C. To the resulting
suspension was added 872 ml of isopropyl alcohol and
112 ml of hexamethyldisiloxane. The flask content was
stirred for 45 minutes at room temperature and then 2.4
L of toluene were added to the flask. The flask
content was stirred for 5 minutes, stirring stopped and
the flask content allowed to separate into an aqueous
phase and a toluene phase. The aqueous phase was
drained from the flask and the toluene phase was washed
with 1 L of deionized water. The flask was fitted with
a Dean-Stark trap and the toluene phase refluxed to
remove residual water. The toluene was evaporated and
the hydrophobic silica gel further dried overnight at 
150°C. The yield of the dried hydrophobic silica gel
was 209.7 g.</p><p num="0043">Samples 2-5. Silica hydrosols containing

Clear Sodium Silicate (PQ Corporation, Valley Forge,
PA) diluted with 960 ml of deionized water to a rapidly
stirring solution of 136 ml of concentrated HCl in 504
ml of deionized water (pH=1.7). The pH of the
resulting silica hydrosol was adjusted to pH 4 with a
dilute solution of PQ N Clear Sodium Silicate (0.1 g

silica hydrogel where aged at room temperature for the
following times: sample 2, 3.5 h; sample 3, 8 h;
sample 4, 24 h; and sample 5, 96 h. After aging for
the specified times, each sample was treated as
follows. 500 ml of concentrated HCl was added to the
silica hydrogel sample followed by 833 ml of isopropyl
alcohol and 227 ml of hexamethyldisiloxane. The
resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1
h and then 1.5 L of toluene added to the sample along
with stirring. Stirring was stopped and the sample
allowed to separate into an aqueous phase and a toluene
phase. The aqueous phase was discarded and 250 ml of
isopropyl alcohol and 50 ml of deionized water added to
the toluene phase. The sample was rapidly stirred for
2 minutes. Then 700 ml of deionized water were added
to the sample with mixing and the sample again allowed
to phase separate. The aqueous phase was discarded.
The flask containing the sample was fitted with a Dean-Stark
