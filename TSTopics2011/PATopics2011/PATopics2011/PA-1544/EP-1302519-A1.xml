photopolymerizable compositions, processes for applying and curing the
compositions and articles bearing a cured coating of the compositions.
More specifically, this invention pertains to radiation-curable compositions
which contain, in addition to the typical components of radiation-curable
compositions, a polymer derived from 3,4-epoxy-1-butene.</p><heading><u style="single">Background of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0002">Radiation curing or photopolymerization (photo-induced free radical
polymerization) has become an important and useful technique for applying
and curing coatings, inks and adhesives. Radiation-curable compositions
typically comprise as essential components one or more radiation-curable
monomers and a photoinitiator. The compositions are applied as a coating
to various articles and surfaces and the monomers are polymerized to form
a film by exposing the coating of the radiation-curable composition to
radiation, typically ultraviolet (UV) or electron-beam radiation.</p><p num="0003">Radiation-curable compositions utilizing photo-induced, free-radical
polymerization reactions are finding uses today in a wide variety of
industrial processes. See, for example, <i>Radiation Curing Science and
Technology,</i> S.P. Pappas, editor, Plenum Press, New York <b>1992</b>, page 2.
For example, radiation-curable coating compositions are a mainstay of the
wood coatings industry and are widely employed as protective and
decorative coatings for metals, plastics and paper, as well as for photocurable
printing inks and adhesives. The use of radiation-curable coating
compositions is growing rapidly due to the inherent low energy
requirements of this technology as well as the need to eliminate the use of
organic solvents which are air and water pollutants. In addition, the 
polymers that are formed possess excellent chemical resistance and
mechanical properties. Free radical polymerizations have reached
reasonably large commercial usage in the past decade and are currently
growing at an overall rate of approximately 15% per year. This growth is
expected to continue as industry becomes more aware of the manifold
benefits of UV curing and as more restrictive environmental legislation
mandating lower volatile organic compound emissions is enacted.</p><p num="0004">Radiation curing presents many advantages such as high production
rates, low energy requirements and low equipment costs. In addition, it is
advantageous that users are able to avoid using a solvent in the formulation
of coating compositions. Solvents typically lead to environmental and/or
safety hazards and require additional equipment and handling steps to
remove the solvent.</p><p num="0005">Current research efforts are directed primarily to three major areas:
(1) the design and synthesis of new photoinitiator systems, (2) the
development of novel monomers and (3) the development of additives that
modify either the cure characteristics or enhance the mechanical
performance of existing photopolymerizable compositions, primarily
acrylate and methacrylate systems. The present invention pertains to the
use of poly(3,4-epoxy-1-butene) (polyepoxybutene) as a component of
novel photoinitiator systems or compositions and as a matrix modifier in
photoinitiated free radical photopolymerizations.</p><heading><u style="single">Brief Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0006">The present invention provides a novel photopolymerizable coating
composition comprising (i) an ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable
compound or monomer; (ii) a photoinitiator; and (iii) polyepoxybutene. The
polyepoxybutene is an inexpensive hydrogen donor synergist for the free
radical polymerization of the ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable
compound or monomer when the coating composition is exposed to UV 
radiation. Polyepoxybutene also may function as a chain transfer agent
during the free radical polymerization and reduce the oxygen inhibition
effect which is responsible for delayed and incomplete
photopolymerizations when the free radical polymerization is carried out in
the presence of oxygen. The oxygen inhibition effect can cause the coating
to exhibit poor mechanical properties and chemical resistance, especially in
thin film applications.</p><p num="0007">Another embodiment of the present invention is a coating or film
comprising a polymer of an ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable
compound or monomer and polyepoxybutene. The cured coating also
contains a photoinitiator or photoinitiator residue. The cured coating is
believed to comprise as the film-forming polymer an addition polymer
derived from one or more ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable
monomers having reacted therein or thereon polyepoxybutene. The
coating compositions and coatings prepared therefrom may be used as
protective and decorative coatings for metals, plastics, wood, and glass.
They also may find use as adhesives, printing inks, electrical and electronic
encapsulants.</p><p num="0008">Polyepoxybutene is a highly useful additive and matrix modifier for
photoinitiated, free-radical crosslinking polymerizations. We have found
that polyepoxybutene functions as a hydrogen donor together with aromatic
ketones to form an efficient photoinitiating system for photopolymerization
reactions. Polyepoxybutene can increase conversions in photocurable
multifunctional acrylate systems due to both chain transfer and grafting
effects. During photopolymerization, grafting of the ethylenically-unsaturated,
photopolymerizable compound or monomer onto the
backbone of polyepoxybutene takes place. Thus, polyepoxybutene
becomes an integral part of the cured polymer matrix. We also have found
that the polyepoxybutene present in our novel photopolymerizable coating
compositions reduces oxygen inhibition effects in photoinduced free radical 
polymerization systems leading to lower cost curing processes through the
elimination of the use of nitrogen as an inerting gas.</p><p num="0009">In addition, polyepoxybutene has other properties that make it
valuable for free radical photocuring processes. Polyepoxybutene is a high
molecular weight material with some film-forming characteristics. This
makes it attractive for use in coating and ink formulations that require some
viscoelastic properties for optimal deposition, flow and adhesion
characteristics.</p><heading><u style="single">Detailed Description</u></heading><p num="0010">The ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable compound or
monomer typically is an α,β-ethylenically-unsaturated, non-air-curing, free-radical-polymerizable
monomer or oligomer or mixture of monomers or
oligomers. The nature of the molecule is not critical so long as it is activated
towards free-radical polymerization via the double bonds when it is exposed
to UV radiation in the presence of a conventional photoinitiator compound.
Such unsaturated compounds include among other types, acrylic
monomers, styrenic monomers, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, vinyl imides, vinyl
amides, maleates, fumarates and mixtures thereof. Preferred monomers
are acrylic monomers and oligomers and maleate and fumarate monomers
and oligomers of number average molecular weight less than 4000
containing from 1 to 10 unsaturated groups per molecule. A particularly
preferred group of acrylic monomers is represented by the structure:
<img id="img-00040001" orientation="unknown" wi="154" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00040001.tif" inline="no" he="20"/>
wherein R<sup>1</sup> is selected from hydrogen, methyl and ethyl, where n is 1 to 10,
preferably 1, 2 or 3, and Z is a saturated or ethylenically-unsaturated
residue of an alcohol or polyol, a carboxylic acid or polycarboxylic acid, an
amine or a polyamine, an epoxide or polyepoxide or an isocyanate or 
polyisocyanate of a number average molecular weight less than 4000
containing a hydrocarbon, ester, amide, ether or urethane backbone. Such
monomers may be obtained by reaction of acryloyl, methacryloyl or
ethacryloyl chloride with an alcohol, a polyol, an amine, or a polyamine or
by the reaction of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or ethacrylic acid with an
epoxide, a polyepoxide, an isocyanate, or a polyisocyanate, or by reaction
of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate, methacrylate or ethacrylate with a carboxylic
acid, polycarboxylic acid, an epoxide, a polyepoxide, an isocyanate, or a
polyisocyanate. Such monomers include methyl acrylate, methyl
methacrylate, butyl acrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol
diacrylate, the polyacrylates, polymethacrylates and polyethacrylates of
polyethylene glycols and polyols, polypropylene glycols and polyols and
poly(tetramethylene glycols) and poly(tetramethylene) polyols of molecular
weight in the range of 100 to 4000, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, trimethylolpropane
triacrylate, dipentaerythritol monohydroxypentacrylate, ethoxylated
bisphenol A dimethacrylate, the diacrylates, dimethacrylates and diethacrylates
of epoxy compounds formed from bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin of
molecular weight in the range of 200 to 4000, and the polyacryloyl
monomers prepared by reacting isocyanate capped polyethers and
isocyanate-capped polyesters of molecular weight up to 4000 with
hydroxyethyl acrylate. The ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable
compounds also may be selected from styrene and unsaturated polyesters,
e.g., low molecular weight polyesters containing residues of maleic and/or
fumaric acid, residues of one or more diols and, optionally, residues of one
or more other dicarboxylic acids such as isophthalic acid. The ethylenically-unsaturated,
photopolymerizable compounds most commonly used
comprise multifunctional acrylic or methacrylic monomers such as:
1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, neopentylglycol
diacrylate, diethyleneglycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, 
dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate, polyurethane diacrylate, and diacrylate
esters of polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of 200 to 10,000.</p><p num="0011">The photoinitiator present in the compositions of the present
invention may be selected from the various photoinitiator compounds which
are to cause the above-described ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable
compounds to polymerize when a coating of the photopolymerizable
compound containing the photoinitiator is exposed to UV, X-ray or electron
beam radiation. Examples of such photoinitiators include aromatic ketones
such as benzophenone, Michler's ketone [4,4'-bis(methylamino)benzophenone],
4,4'-bis(diethylamino)benzophenone, 4-acryloxy-4'-diethylamino-benzophenone,
4-methoxy-4'-dimethylaminobenzophenone, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone,
camphorquinone, 2-ethylanthraquinone,
phenanthraquinone, 2-t-butylanthraquinone, 1,2-benzanthraquinone,
2,3-benzanthraquinone, 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone, benzil dimethyl ketal
and other known aromatic ketones such as those described, for example, in
U.S. Patent 3,552,973; benzoin, benzoin ethers such as benzoin methyl
ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ether, and benzoin phenyl
ether; methyl benzoin, ethyl benzoin and other benzoins.</p><p num="0012">The effective amount or concentration of the photoinitiator can vary
depending upon a number of factors such as the rate of cure desired, the
lamp intensity used, whether or not an inert atmosphere is used, the type of
monomer(s) employed, and the presence of fillers, pigments and other
additives. Normally, the amount of photoinitiator present in the
photopolymerizable compositions of the present invention are in the range
of 0.1 to 10 mole percent based on the moles of ethylenically-unsaturated,
photopolymerizable compound with concentrations of 0.5 to 5.0 mole
percent (same basis) being preferred.</p><p num="0013">The polyepoxybutene polymers which may be used in the present
invention are known compositions of matter and may be prepared
according to known procedures, e.g., the procedures described in U.S. 
Patent 5,536,882 and copending PCT Publication No. WO 00/66649,
published November 9, 2000. The polyepoxybutene polymers may be
prepared by reacting or polymerizing 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (epoxybutene) in
the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst and a nucleophilic initiator.
Examples of the polyepoxybutene polymers include polyether compounds
comprising n units of residue (1) and m units of residue (2) wherein the total
value of n+m is 2 to 70, preferably 3 to 20, n/(n+m) is a value of 0.70 to
1.00, and residues (1) and (2) have the structures:

The polyepoxybutene polymers may be prepared by contacting 3,4-epoxy-1-butene
with a hydroxyl initiator compound in the presence of a catalytic
amount of an acidic compound as described in U.S. Patent 5,536,882.</p><p num="0014">The amount of polyepoxybutene which may be present in the novel
photopolymerizable coating composition of the present invention typically is
1 to 80 weight percent, preferably 5 to 20 weight percent, polyepoxybutene
based on the total weight of the ethylenically-unsaturated,

photopolymerizable compound or monomer and the polyepoxybutene.</p><p num="0015">The coating compositions may be prepared simply by mixing the
liquid ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable monomer or monomers
and the liquid polyepoxybutene and dissolving the photoinitiator in the
mixed liquids. The coatings or films produced from the coating
compositions of the present invention typically have a thickness of 2.5 to
125 microns, more typically, 12 to 75 microns. The coating compositions
may contain other ingredients such as fillers, plasticizers, flow control
agents, flatting agents, pigments, dyes and other colorants. </p><p num="0016">There are two major classes of high quantum yield photoinitiator
systems used in free radical polymerizations. The first class comprises
photofragmentation photoinitiators. Such photoinitiators undergo either
Norrish type I or II bond cleavages upon excitation with UV light. These
systems have the advantage of simplicity and high quantum yield but suffer
from high cost and inherent thermal instability that limits pot life in the
presence of highly reactive acrylate and methacrylate monomers. The
second class of photoinitiator systems is called hydrogen abstraction
photoinitiators and consists of an aromatic ketone in combination with a
hydrogen donor. Upon excitation, the aromatic ketone undergoes efficient
crossover from the initially formed excited singlet to the excited triplet state.
The excited triplet ketone exhibits diradical character and abstracts
hydrogen atoms from the donor. This reaction is exemplified below in
equation 1 where D-H represents a hydrogen donor.
<img id="img-00080001" orientation="unknown" wi="156" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00080001.tif" inline="no" he="23"/>
The benzhydrol free radical typically dimerizes while the radical formed by
hydrogen abstraction can initiate the polymerization of a vinyl monomer.
Typical aromatic ketones used for this purpose are benzophenone,
Michler's ketone, thioxanthone and 2-isopropylthioxanthone. Although a
wide variety of hydrogen donor synergists have been employed, the most
popular are diethanolamine and triethanolamine. Hydrogen abstraction
photoinitiators have the advantage that they are inexpensive and display
excellent thermal stability. This latter feature is due to the fact that radical
species are formed only on irradiation with light.</p><p num="0017">Polyepoxybutene is a polymeric allylic ether that possesses easily
abstractable allylic ether hydrogen atoms in each repeating unit along the
polymer backbone. Thus, polyepoxybutene functions as a hydrogen donor 
that together with an aromatic ketone may initiate polymerization under UV
irradiation.</p><p num="0018">In addition to providing grafting sites along the chain for polymer
attachment and growth, polyepoxybutene also functions as a chain transfer
agent during polymerization. The mechanism proposed for chain transfer is
depicted in equation 2:
<img id="img-00090001" orientation="unknown" wi="158" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00090001.tif" inline="no" he="60"/></p><p num="0019">Hydrogen abstraction by the growing acrylate chain results in
termination of that chain to form "dead" chains and at the same time
generates potential new graft sites on polyepoxybutene. Typically, when
multifunctional monomers are employed in photopolymerizations, the
conversions are low due to entrapment of the growing free radical sites
within the crosslinked matrix. However, the presence of a chain transfer
agent should increase the overall conversion in these systems. Thus, we
have found that photopolymerizable compositions containing
polyepoxybutene proceed to higher conversions than those in which
triethanolamine is used as a hydrogen donor.</p><p num="0020">As compared to conventional chain transfer agents in free radical
polymerizations, the use of polyepoxybutene produces polymers with higher
molecular weights (or higher crosslink densities). In contrast, conventional
chain transfer agents have a strong molecular weight lowering effect on the
resulting acrylate polymer, due to the presence of multiple hydrogen
abstraction (i.e., chain transfer and graft) sites along the backbone. </p><p num="0021">One of the most difficult problems to overcome in free radical
photopolymerizations is the sensitivity of these reactions to the presence of
oxygen. The well known "oxygen inhibition effect" is responsible for
delayed and incomplete photopolymerizations and contributes to poor
mechanical properties and chemical resistance, particularly in thin film
applications. This problem may be overcome by simply carrying out such
polymerizations in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen. However, this is
not always an acceptable or practical solution that can be used in all cases
and, especially, for many low-cost, high-speed applications. The oxygen
inhibition problem can be minimized or avoided by including in the coating
compositions additives that rapidly consume dissolved molecular oxygen in
the film undergoing photopolymerization. Typically, the additives that are
most useful are those that undergo facile autoxidation such as amines.
Polyepoxybutene undergoes autoxidation by virtue of the presence of the
easily abstracted allylic ether hydrogen atoms situated along the backbone.
We have discovered that the addition of polyepoxybutene to
photopolymerizable coating compositions comprising (i) an ethylenically-unsaturated,
photopolymerizable compound or monomer and (ii) a
photoinitiator results in the mitigation of the oxygen inhibition effect. Usually,
the depletion of oxygen occurs more rapidly than the rate of diffusion of
oxygen into the film of the coating composition allowing free radical
polymerization of the ethylenically-unsaturated, photopolymerizable
compound or monomer to proceed.</p><heading><u style="single">Examples</u></heading><p num="0022">The coating compositions of the present invention and their
preparation and use in preparing novel coatings are further illustrated by the
following examples. The polyepoxybutene used in the examples was
prepared by the boron trifluoride etherate-catalyzed, ring-opening
polymerization of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene carried out in the presence of 
1,4-butanediol. This hydroxyl-terminated oligomer had a ratio of residue (1)
to residue (2) of 95:5 and a number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>)
determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of 1413 g/mol
(polystyrene standards). The acrylic monomers used in this investigation
were purified by distillation prior to use. Triethanolamine and the aromatic
ketones used in this work were used as purchased unless otherwise noted.
Routine infrared spectra were obtained using a Midac-M1300 Fourier
transform Infrared spectrometer. Gas chromatographic (GC) analyses were
performed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Gas Chromatograph equipped
with a 10 m 5% OV-17 phenylsilicone capillary column and a flame
ionization detector. <sup>1</sup>H NMR experiments were carried out using either
Varian XL-200 (200 MHz) or Inova-300 (300 MHz) spectrometers at room
temperature using chloroform-d as the solvent and employing
tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Thermal gravimetric
analyses were carried out in air at a heating rate of 40°C/minute using a
Perkin-Elmer (Stamford, CT) Thermal Analyzer equipped with a TGA-7
module. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out with the
aid of a Hewlett-Packard, Gel Permeation Chromatograph equipped with a
refractive index detector and µ-styragel columns (particle size 5 µm, mixed
24-34 Å pores). Chloroform was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0
mL/min.</p><p num="0023">The photopolymerizable coating compositions were prepared by
dissolving the aryl ketone in the monomer and then adding polyepoxybutene
at room temperature. One drop of the photopolymerizable coating
compositions was placed onto a 12 µm oriented and corona treated
polypropylene film (General Electric Capacitor Dept., Hudson Falls, NY),
covered with an identical polypropylene film, and then mounted in 5 cm x 5
cm slide frames. These samples are designated as "covered" indicating
that they are protected by means of the polymer film from the atmosphere.
Other samples were knife coated onto the polypropylene films and mounted 
as described above in 5 cm x 5 cm slide frames. These samples are
designated as "uncovered" since the liquid films are exposed to
atmospheric oxygen. The thickness of the coating composition films was
estimated at 10-25 µm. The coating compositions were polymerized
(cured) using broadband, i.e., unfiltered UV irradiation from a mercury arc
lamp. Photopolymerizations of the coating compositions were carried out at
room temperature and were monitored using Fourier transform real-time
infrared spectroscopy (FT-RTIR). A Midac M-1300 FTIR spectrometer
equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector
was used. The instrument was fitted with a UVEXS Model SCU-110
mercury arc lamp equipped with a flexible liquid optic wand. The end of this
wand was directed at an incident angle of 45° onto the sample window and
the distance from the window varied from 6-18 cm to control the light
intensity. UV light intensities were measured with the aid of a radiometer
(UV Process Supply, Inc., Chicago, IL) at the sample window. A light
intensity of 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> was employed in the photopolymerizations
described in the examples.</p><p num="0024">Infrared spectra were collected at a rate of 1 spectrum per second
using LabCalc, data acquisition software obtained from the Galactic
Industries Corp. and were processed using GRAMS-386 software from the
same company. During irradiation, the decrease in the absorbance band
due to the carbonyl groups at 1640 cm<sup>-1</sup> of the respective acrylic
monomers was monitored. Data analysis and subsequent conversion
versus time plots were obtained using Excel software (Microsoft Corp.
Redmond, WA). Three to five runs were performed for each kinetic study
and the results averaged to give the final conversion versus time data
contained in the following tables. Under these conditions, the run-to-run
reproducibility was ± 5%. </p><heading><u style="single">Example 1</u></heading><p num="0025">A solution of 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (2.26 g), benzophenone

were combined with stirring at room temperature to make a homogeneous
solution. A thin sample of this composition was prepared and UV cured as
described above for a period of 2 minutes. The polymeric film that was
obtained was dissolved in chloroform and precipitated into methanol. This
procedure was repeated twice to free the polymer from residual monomer.
Comparison of a <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of the dried polymer with the spectra of
authentic samples of polyepoxybutene and isobornyl acrylate show that the
polymeric coating bears a series of new methyl bands that can be attributed
to the isobornyl group of the acrylate grafted polymer. The polymer also
contains resonances that can be attributed to the allylic double bond of
polyepoxybutene. This experiment demonstrates that acrylate groups are
efficiently grafted onto the backbone of polyepoxybutene during free radical
polymerization.</p><heading><u style="single">Reference Example 1</u></heading><p num="0036">The following procedure is exemplary of the methods by which

and 16.4 g (0.12 mole) of boron trifluoride etherate. To the rapidly-stirred
mixture was added 3,4-epoxy-1-butene via feed pump. During the addition,
the temperature was allowed to rise from room temperature then it was held
at 30-35°C. After 1141 g of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene had been added, the 
catalyst was judged to have become deactivated (no longer exothermic).
The addition was briefly stopped to add another 3.8 g of boron trifluoride
etherate (dissolved in 3.8 g of diethyl ether) to the mixture. The monomer
addition was continued with three more catalyst additions (total catalyst
weight 25.4 g, 0.18 mole). A total of 1401.4 g (19.99 moles) of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene

temperature overnight. Twelve grams of water was added to the reaction
mixture then it was stirred for three hours before adding 65.6 g of calcium
oxide. After several hours the slurry was filtered through a steam-heated
filter funnel containing Celite® to give a light yellow liquid. This liquid was
stripped of low boiling point components by passage through a wiped-film
evaporator at 129°C and 1.2 mm. The polyepoxybutene was the nonvolatile
