The gels of this invention are extremely soft, flexible, and have elastic memory, characterized by a gel rigidity of from about less than 2 gram to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher. These and other properties are particularly essential for the gels to have utility as composites, toys, therapeutic hand excercising grips, electrical and electronic encapsulation, shock absorbers, acoustical isolators, components for cushions, medical, sports medical, and many other uses. The gels are characterized by a rigidity of about 350 grams to about 1,800 gram Bloom, a tear resistance of at least about 1 Kg/cm, and strands of the gel are capable of flossing at least ten cycles without completely breaking apart as tested under fully contacting surfaces under a uniform spring load of 0.9027 Kg.</p></abstract><description lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><?description-type Parent Case Text?><heading>ORIGINS OF INVENTION AND RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p>This application is a CIP of Ser.

The gels also possess high tensile strength and rapid return from high extension and can exist in an altered state of delay elastomeric recovery as it regains its original shape following high extensions or dynamic deformations. Such combination of properties are not found in gels of substantially the same rigidity made from triblock copolymers. The gels of the present invention also exhibit low set, high dimensional stability, crack, tear, craze, and creep resistance, excellent tensile strength and high elongation, long dynamic shear, tear and stress forces, excellent processing ability for cast molding, extruding, fiber forming film forming and spinning, non-toxic, nearly tasteless and odorless, soft and strong, optically clear, highly flexible, processing elastic memory, substantially with little or no plasticizer bleedout. The gels are especially suitable and have advantages where resistance to dynamic stretching, shearing and tearing forces are particularly critical such as those forces acting during dental flossing, while gels in the altered state with delay elastomeric recovery from deformation and extension are excellent for use where energy and vibration damping at high impact, low frequencies, such as in running shoe cushioning designs are essential.</p><p>Moreover, the gels can be made with selectively lower gel rigidities while achieving higher tensile strength or can be orientated to achieve high gel rigidities with lower gel tensile strengths.</p><p>Generally, the unique tear resistant gels comprises: (I) 100 parts by weight of one or more of a crystalline linear or star-shaped multiblock copolymers or a mixture of two or more of said copolymers; said linear multiblock copolymer have the general configuration A--Z--A and said star-shaped multiblock copolymer have the general configuration (A--Z)n, the subscript n being a number and in the case n is the interger 2, (A--Z).sub.2 denotes simply A--Z--A; wherein each A is a selected glassy polymer end block segment of polystyrene, poly(alpha-methylstyrene), poly(o-methylstyrene), poly(m-methylstyrene), poly(p-methylstyrene) or poly(tertiary-butylstyrene) and wherein Z is a midblock of one or more polymer chains of crystalline forming poly(ethylene) in combination with one or more polymer chains of poly(ethylene-butylene) or poly(ethylene-propylene);

These domains serve to crosslink and reinforce the structure. This physical elastomeric network structure is reversible, and heating the polymer above the softening point of the glassy domains temporarily disrupt the structure, which can be restored by lowering the temperature. The disruption of the sub-micron domains due to heating above the softening point forces the glassy domains to open up, unlocking the network structure and flow. Upon cooling below the softening point, the glassy polymers reforms together into sub-micron domains, locking into a network structure once again, resisting flow. It is this unlocking and locking of the network structure on the sub-micron scale with the surfaces of various materials which allows the gel to form interlocking composites with other materials.</p><p>Theory notwithstanding, the multiblock copolymer gel properties can be attributed to the additional blocks affecting the separate polymer phases, the additional blocks affecting the heterophase structure, the additional blocks affecting the interfacial regions between phases of the multiblock polymers or the additional blocks forming a separate phase or inducing the formation of additional separate phases. Due to the additional number of midblocks of the copolymers (I), the difference in solubility parameters between (A) and (Z) becomes greater than the solubility parameters differences between (A) and (D) of triblock copolymers, where D denotes the lone midblock polymer chain. Moreover, the presence of additional midblocks of ethylene, propylene, butylene, ethylene-propylene, or ethylene-butylene can contribute to stress-induced crystallization. This may explain why as the viscosity of the multiblock copolymers is increased to a higher level, the appearance of the gels change from crystal clear to more translucent white.</p><p>The gels of the present invention resist tearing under tensile loads or dynamic deformation in that when cut or notched, the "crack" made on the gel deep surface does not readily propagate further under dynamic deformation or tensile loads. Unlike triblock copolymer gels, such as (SEBS) and (SEPS) gels which possess high tensile strength and will catastrophically snap apart into two reflective clean smooth surfaces when cut or notched under tensile or dynamic loads. Furthermore, when elongated, the instant gels can exhibit two or more draw plateaus and can possess high tensile strength and rapid return from high extension without noticeable set or deformation. As observed, the gels can be stretched by a first tensile load with uniform deformation to a measured length, upon the application of higher tensile loads, the gel can be further extended without breaking. Upon release, the gel returns immediate to its original shape and any necking quickly disappears. Again, theory notwithstanding, the additional drawing plateaus of the gel can be attributed to yielding of crystalline formations ethylene or propylene components in the gel or yield of induced interfacial regions of concentrated ethylene or propylene between the domains which during extension absorbs the elastic energy. Likewise, the resistance to tear propagation of the instant gels when notched under tensile load can be attributed to yielding of the gel midblock components, yielding of additional phases, or yielding of interfacial regions before rupture or deformation of the (A) domains can take place.</p><p>Additionally, shearing, heating or cooling form the molten state can alter the gels' state. Thei nstant gels can be made to exhibit long elastomeric recovery times. Such gels can be used effectively in suppressing low frequency vibrations and for absorbing energy. The unusual properties of the gels can be attribured to altering different phase or interfacial arrangements of the domains of the multiblock copolymers.</p><p>It should be noted that when the Z to Z ratios falls substantially below about 30:70, various properties such as elongation, tensile strength, tear resistance and the like can decrease while retaining other desired properties, such as gel rigidity, flexibility, elastic memory.</p><p>In general, for these block copolymers, the various measured viscosities of 5, 10, 15, and 20, weight percent solution values in toluene at 30 C. can be extrapolated to a selected concentration. For example, a solution viscosity of a 5 weight percent copolymer solution in toluene can be determined by extrapolation of 10, 15, and 20 weight percent measurements to 5 weight percent concentration.</p><p>The Brookfield Viscosities can be measured at various neat polymer concentrations, for example, the selected high viscosity linear multiblock coplymers in (I) can have a typical Brookfield Viscosity value of a 20 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25 cps and higher, and advantageously about 2,000 cps and higher. Typically, the Brookfield Viscosity values can range from at least about 1,800 to about 16,000 cps and higher. More typically, the Brookfield Viscosity values can range from at least about 1,800 cps to about 40,000 cps and higher. Still more typically, the Brookfield Viscosity values can range from at least about 1,800 cps to about 80,000 cps and higher. Due to structural variations between the multiblock and star-shaped copolymers, the high viscosity star-shaped or radial copolymers, typically, may exhibit a lower Brookfield Viscosity value than its counterpart linear multiblock copolymers. However, when the multiblock copolymers are considered as star-shaped or branched, then at equal branch lengths, the solution viscosities of the multiblock copolymers and branched copolymers are about the same or equivalent.</p><p>In all cases, the molecular chain lengths (molecular weights) of the multiblock and star-shaped (or radial) copolymers (I) must be sufficient to meet the high solution Brookfield Viscosities requirements described herein that is necessary for making the soft, strong and extreme tear resistant gels.</p><p>The copolymers (I) selected have Brookfield Viscosity values ranging from about 1,800 cps to about 80,000 cps and higher when measured at 20 weight percent measured at 25 weight percent solids solution toluene. Typical examples of Brookfield Viscosity values for star-shaped copolymers at 25 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25 about 3,500 cps to about 30,000 cps and higher; more typically, about 9,000 cps and higher. Other advantageous multiblock and multiblock star-shaped copolymers can exhibit viscosities (as measured with a Brookfield model RVT viscometer at 25 solution in toluene of about 400 cps and higher and at 15 weight percent solution in toluene of about 5,600 cps and higher. Other advantageous multiblock and star-shaped copolymers can exhibit about 8,000 to about 20,000 cps at 20 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25 C.

Shell Technical Bulletin SC:1393-92 gives solution viscosity as measured with a Brookfield model RVT viscometer at 25 toluene of approximately 400 cps and at 15% weight in toluene of approximately 5,600 cps. Shell publication SC:68-79 gives solution viscosity at 25 toluene of approximately 2,000 cps. When measured at 5 weight percent solution in toluene at 30 1651 is about 40. Examples of high viscosity SEBS triblock copolymers includes Kuraray's SEBS 8006 which exhibits a solution viscosity at 5 weight percent at 30 polymer exhibits a viscosity at 20 weight percent solution in toluene at 30 10 weight percent of about 1220 cps, and at 20 weight percent 78,000 cps. Kuraray SEPS 2005 polymer exhibits a viscosity at 5 weight percent solution in toluene at 30 of about 1200 cps, and at 20 weight percent 76,000 cps. Other grades of SEBS, SEPS, (SEB).sub.n, (SEP).sub.n polymers can also be utilized in the present invention provided such polymers exhibits the required high viscosity. Such SEBS polymers include (high viscosity) Kraton G 1855X which has a Specific Gravity of 0.92, Brookfield Viscosity of a 25 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25 about 8,000 to about 20,000 cps at a 20 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 25</p><p>The styrene to ethylene and butylene (S:EB) weight ratios for the Shell designated polymers can have a low range of 20:80 or less. Although the typical ratio values for Kraton G 1651, 4600, and 4609 are approximately about 33:67 and for Kraton G 1855X approximately about 27:73, Kraton G 1654X (a lower molecular weight version of Kraton G 1651 with somewhat lower physical properties such as lower solution and melt viscosity) is approximately about 31:69, these ratios can vary broadly from the typical product specification values. In the case of Kuraray's SEBS polymer 8006 the S:EB weight ratio is about 35:65. In the case of Kuraray's 2005 (SEPS), and 2006 (SEPS), the S:EP weight ratios are 20:80 and 35:65 respectively. Much like S:EB ratios of SEBS and (SEB).sub.n, the SEP ratios of very high viscosity SEPS triblock copolymers are about the same and can typically vary as broadly.</p><p>The triblock copolymers (II) such as Kraton G 1654X having ratios of 31:69 or higher can be used and do exhibit about the same physical properties in many respects to Kraton G 1651 while Kraton G 1654X with ratios below 31:69 may also be use, but they are less advantageous due to their decrease in the desirable properties of the final gel.</p><p>Plasticizers particularly advantageous for use in practicing the present invention are will known in the art, they include rubber processing oils such as paraffinic and naphthenic petroleum oils, highly refined aromatic-free paraffinic and naphthenic food and technical grade white petroleum mineral oils, and synthetic liquid oligomers of polybutene, polypropene, polyterpene, etc. The synthetic series process oils are high viscosity oligomers which are permanently fluid liquid nonolefins, isoparaffins or paraffins of moderate to high molecular weight.</p><p>Examples of representative commercially available plasticizing oils include Amoco functionality at one end of polybutene polymer, liquid poly(ethylene/butylene), liquid heter-telechelic polymers of poly(ethylene/butylene/sytrene) with epoxidized polyisoprene and poly(ethylene/butylene) with epoxidized polyisoprene: Example of such polybutenes include: L-14 (320 Mn), L-50 (420 Mn), L-100 (460 Mn), H-15 (560 Mn, H-25 (610 Mn), H-35 (660 Mn), H-50 (750 Mn), H-100 (920 Mn), H-300 (1290 Mn), L-14E (27-37 cst @ 100 (635-690 cst @ 210 Mn), E23 (1433 Mn), Kraton L-1203, EKP-206, EKP-207, HPVM-2203 and the like. Example of various commercially oils include: ARCO Prime (55, 70, 90, 200, 350, 400 and the like), Duraprime and Tufflo oils (6006, 6016, 6016M, 6026, 6036, 6056, 6206, etc.), other white mineral oils include: Bayol, Bernol, American, Blandol, Drakeol, Ervol, Gloria, Kaydol, Litetek, Lyondell (Duraprime 55, 70, 90, 200, 350, 400, etc.), Marcol, Parol, Peneteck, Primol, Protol, Sontex, and the like.</p><p>Generally, plasticizing oils with average molecular weights less than about 200 and greater than about 700 may also be used (e.g. H-300 (1290 Mn)).</p><p>Of all the factors, the amount of plasticizing oils can be controlled and adjusted advantageously to obtain substantially higher tear and tensile strength gels. The improvements in tensile strength of the gels are accompanied by corresponding increase in gel rigidity as the amount of plasticizing oils are lowered until the rigidity of the gels becomes much higher than that of the gums which surround the teeth. Although higher tensile strengths can be obtained as the amount of plasticizing oils in the gel approaches zero, the tensile strength of the floss, however, must be maintained at an acceptable gel rigidity (at sufficient high plasticizing oil levels) in order to be as soft as the gums required for flossing. For example, the rigidities of a gel containing 100, 200, or 300 parts by weight of oil is much higher than a gel containing 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, or 900 parts of oil.</p><p>These gels can exhibit a larger unit lateral contraction at the same elongation per unit of length as their counterpart parent gels from which the new gels are derived or formed. This property would allow a same unit volume of gel when elongated as its parent to easily wedge between the teeth when flossing. It would seem that a gel having the 1.0 cm.sup.3 volume made from a ratio of 100 parts by weight of copolymer and 400 parts plasticizer would have a unique macro volume configurations that is at equilibrium with the plasticizer when is much like a 3-D fingerprint which is uniquely different from any other gel of a different copolymer to plasticizer ratio. Reducing the plasticizer content of a ratio 100:400 gel to a 100:300 ratio of copolymer to plasticizer will decrease the amount of plasticizer, but the original macro volume configurations will remain the same.</p><p>Speculative theories not withstanding, configurations may take the form of (1) swiss cheese, (2) sponge, (3) the insides of a loaf of bread, (4) structures liken to ocean brain corals, (5) large structures and small structures forming the 3-D gel volume landscape, (6) the outer heated surface which cools faster than the inner volumes of the gel during its cooling histories may have a patterned crust (rich in A micro-phases) like that of a loaf of bread and the inner volume may have much like 1-5, and (7) the many different possible structures are unlimited and volume landscapes may be interconnected at the macro-level by threads or micro-strands of Z micro-phases.</p><p>The amount of plasticizer extracted can advantageously range from less than about 10% by weight to about 90% and higher of the total weight of the plasticizer. More advantageously, the extracted amounts of plasticizer can range from less than about 20% by weight to about 80% by weight of the total plasticizer, and still more advantageously, from about 25% to about 75%. Plasticizing oils contained in the gels can be extracted by any conventional methods, such as solvent extraction, physical extraction, pressure, pressure-heat, heat-solvent, pressure-solvent-heat, vacuum extraction, vacuum-heat extraction, vacuum-pressure extraction, vacuum-heat-pressure extraction, vacuum-solvent extraction, vacuum-heat-solvent-pressure extraction, etc. The solvents selected, should be solvents which do not substantially disrupt the A and Z phases of the (I) copolymers forming the gels. Any solvent which will extract plasticizer from the gel and do not disrupt the A and Z phases can be utilized. Suitable solvents include alcohols, primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, glycols, etc., examples include methanol, ethanol, tetradecanol, etc. Likewise, the pressures and heat applied to remove the desired amounts of oils should not be sufficient to disrupt the A and Z domains of the (I) copolymers. To form a lower rigidity gel, the simplest method is to subject the gel to heat in a partial vacuum or under higher vacuum for a selected period of time, depending on the amount of plasticizer to be extracted.</p><p>The gels can be made non-adhearing, non-sticking, (non-tacky), by incorporating an advantage amount of stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), metal stearates (e.g., calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, etc.), polyethylene glycol distearate, polypropylene glycol ester or fatty acid, and polytetramethylene oxide glycol disterate, waxes, stearic acid and waxes, metal stearate and waxes, metal stearate and stearic acid. The use of stearic acid alone do not reduce tack. The amount of stearic acid is also important. As an example, ratio of 200 grams stearic acid to 2,000 gram of SEBS (a ratio of 0.1) will result in spotted tack reduction on the surface of the gel. A ratio of 250 to 2,000 will result in spotted crystallized regions on the surface of the gel or spotted tack reduction. A ratio of 300 to 2,000 will result in complete tack reduction with large stearic acid crystallized regions on the surface of the gel. When microcrystalline waxes are incorporated together with stearic acid, the crystallization of stearic acid completely disappears from the surface of the gel. For example excellent result is achieved with 200 grams of stearic acid, 150 grams of microcrystalline wax and 2,000 grams of SEBS. The same excellent results is achieved when SEBS is adjusted to 3,000 grams, 4,000 grams, etc. The same result is achieved with (I) copolymers as well as in combination with polymers (II) such as SEPS, (SEB).sub.n, (SEP).sub.n polymers.</p><p>The gels can also contain useful amounts of conventionally employed additives such as stabilizers, antioxidants, antiblocking agents, colorants, fragrances, flame retardants, flavors, other polymers in minor amounts and the like to an extend not affecting or substantially decreasing the desired properties. Additives useful in the gel of the present invention include: tetrakis[methylene 3,-(3'5'-di-tertbutyl-4"-hydroxyphenyl) propionate]methane, octadecyl 3-(3",5"-di-tert-butyl-4"-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, distearylpentaerythritol-diproprionate, thiodiethylene bis-(3,5-ter-butyl-4-hydroxy) hydrocinnamate, (1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris[3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl]benzene), 4,4"-methylenebis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol), stearic acid, oleic acid, stearamide, behenamide, oleamide, erucamide, N,N"-ethylenebisstearamide, N,N"-ethylenebisoleamide, stearyl erucamide, erucyl erucamide, oleyl palmitamide, stearyl stearamide, erucyl stearamide, calcium sterate, other metal sterates, waxes (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene, microcrystalline, carnauba, paraffin, montan, candelilla, beeswax, ozokerite, ceresine, and the like). The gel can also contain metallic pigments (aluminum and brass flakes), TiO2, mica, fluorescent dyes and pigments, phosphorescent pigments, aluminatrihydrate, antimony oxide, iron oxides (Fe3O4, --Fe2O3, etc.), iron cobalt oxides, chromium dioxide, iron, barium ferrite, strontium ferrite and other magnetic particle materials, molybdenum, silicone fluids, lake pigments, aluminates, ceramic pigments, ironblues, ultramarines, phthalocynines, azo pigments, carbon blacks, silicon dioxide, silica, clay, feldspar, glass microspheres, barium ferrite, wollastonite and the like.

The gels of the composites are formed from copolymers (I), polymers (II), and plasticizers (III) described above.</p><p>Sandwiches of gel-material (i.e. gel-material-gel or material-gel-material, etc.) are useful as dental floss, shock absorbers, acoustical isolators, vibration dampers, vibration isolators, and wrappers. For example the vibration isolators can be use under research microscopes, office equipment, tables, and the like to remove background vibrations. The tear resistance nature of the instant gels are superior in performance to triblock copolymer gels which are much less resistance to crack propagation caused by long term continue dynamic loadings.</p><p>The gels are prepared by blending together the components including other additatives as desired at about 23 forming a paste like mixture and further heating said mixture uniformly to about 150 blend is obtained. Lower and higher temperatures can also be utilized depending on the viscosity of the oils and amounts of multiblock copolymers (I) and polymer (II) used. These components blend easily in the melt and a heated vessel equipped with a stirrer is all that is required. Small batches can be easily blended in a test tube using a glass stirring rod for mixing. While conventional large vessels with pressure and/or vacuum means can be utilized in forming large batches of the instant compositions in amounts of about 40 lbs or less to 10,000 lbs or more. For example, in a large vessel, inert gases can be employed for removing the composition from a closed vessel at the end of mixing and a partial vacuum can be applied to remove any entrapped bubbles. Stirring rates utilized for large batches can range from about less than 10 rpm to about 40 rpm or higher.</p><p>The gel articles can be formed by blending, injection molding, extruding, spinning, casting and other conventional methods. For example, Shapes having various crossection can be extruded.</p><p>The gels can also be formed directly into articles or remelted in any suitable hot melt applicator and extruded into shaped articles and films or spun into threads, strips, bands, yarns, or other shapes. With respect to various shapes and yarn, its size are conventionally measured in denier (grams/9000 meter), tex (grams/1000 meter), and gage (1/2.54 cm). Gage, tex, denier can be converted as follows: tex=denier/9=specific gravity (2135/gage), for rectangular cross section, tex=specific gravity and w the width of the strip, both in centimeters. General descriptions of (1) block copolymers, (2) elastomeric fibers and conventional (3) gels are found in volume 2, starting at pp. 324-415, volume 6, pp 733-755, and volume 7, pp. 515 of ENCYCLOPEDIA OF POLYMER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, 1987 which volumes are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>The instant gels is excellent for cast molding and the molded products have various excellent characteristics which cannot be anticipated form the properties of the raw components. Other conventional methods of forming the composition can be utilized.</p><p>In general, the basis of this invention resides in the fact that one or more of a high viscosity linear multiblock and star-shaped multiblock copolymers (I) or a mixture of two or more of such copolymers having (A) end block to elastomeric block ratio preferably within the contemplated range of styrene to rubber ratios of from about 20:80 to about 40:60 and higher, more preferably from between about 31:69 to about 40:60 and higher when blended in the melt with an appropriate amount of plasticizing oil makes possible the attainment of gels having a desirable combination of physical and mechanical properties, notably high elongation at break of at least 1,600%, ultimate tensile strength of about 8 dyne/cm.sup.2 and higher, low elongation set at break of substantially not greater than about 2%, tear resistance of 5 and higher, substantially about 100% snap back when extended to 1,200% elongation, and a gel rigidity of substantially from about 2 gram to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher.</p><p>More specifically, the gels of the present invention exhibit one or more of the following properties. These are: (1) tensile strength of about 8 greater; (2) elongation of less than about 1,600% to about 3,000% and higher; (3) elasticity modulus of about 10.sup.4 dyne/cm.sup.2 to about 10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2 and greater; (4) shear modulus of about 10.sup.4 dyne/cm.sup.2 to about 10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2 and greater as measured with a 1, 2, and 3 kilogram load at 23 less than about 2 gram Bloom to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher as measured by the gram weight required to depress a gel a distance of 4 mm with a piston having a cross-sectional area of 1 square cm at 23 C.; (6) tear propagation resistance of at least about 5 dyne/cm.sup.2 ; (7) and substantially 100% snap back recovery when extended at a crosshead separation speed of 25 cm/minute to 1,200% at 23 crosshead separation speed of 25 cm/minute at 23</p><p>The gel articles molded from the instant compositions have various additional important advantages in that they do not crack, creep, tear, crack, or rupture in flexural, tension, compression, or other deforming conditions of normal use; but rather the molded articles made from the instant composition possess the intrinsic properties of elastic memory enabling the articles to recover and retain its original molded shape after many extreme deformation cycles. In applications where extreme tear resistance, low rigidity, high elongation, good compression set and excellent tensile strength are important, the instant gels would be advantageous.</p><p>The gels of the present invention are useful in low frequency vibration applications, such as viscoelastic layers in constrained-layer damping of mechanical structures and goods, as viscoelastic layers used in laminates for isolation of acoustical and mechanical noise, as anti-vibration elastic support for transporting shock sensitive loads, as vibration isolators for an optical table, as viscoelastic layers used in wrappings, enclosures and linings to control sound, as compositions for use in shock and dielectric encapsulation of optical, electrical, and electronic components. The compositions are also useful as molded shape articles for use in medical and sport health care, such use include therapeutic hand exercising grips, dental floss, crutch cushions, cervical pillows, bed wedge pillows, leg rest, neck cushion, mattress, bed pads, elbow padding, dermal pads, wheelchair cushions, helmet liner, cold and hot packs, exercise weight belts, traction pads and belts, cushions for splints, slings, and braces (for the hand, wrist, finger, forearm, knee, leg, clavicle, shoulder, foot, ankle, neck, back, rib, etc.), and also soles for orthopedic shoes. Other uses include various shaped articles as toys, optical uses (e.g. cladding for cushioning optical fibers from bending stresses) and various optical devices, as lint removers, dental floss, as tips for swabs, as fishing bate, as a high vacuum seal (against atmosphere pressure) which contains a useful amount of a mineral oil-based magnetic fluid particles, etc. Moreover, the casted, extruded, or spun threads, strips, yearns, tapes can be weaved into cloths, fine or coarse fabrics.</p><p>The instant compositions can be formed in any shape; the original shape can be deformed into another shape (to contact a regular or irregular surface) by pressure and upon removal of the applied pressure, the composition in the deformed shape will recover back to its original shape.</p><p>As an example of the versatility of use of the instant gels, a hand exerciser can be made in any shape so long as it is suitable for use as a hand exerciser: a sphere shape, a cube shape, a rectangular shape, etc. Likewise, a wheelchair cushion can be made from the composition in any shape, so long as it meets the needs of the user of the cushion. For example, a cushion can be made by forming th composition into a selected shape matching the contours of the specific body part or body region. The composition can be formed into any desired shaped, size and thickness suitable as a cushion; the shaped composition can be additionally surrounded with film, fabric, foam, or any other desired material or combinations thereof. Moreover, the composition can be casted onto such materials, provided such materials substantially maintain their integrity (shape, appearance, texture, etc.) during the casting process. The same applies for brace cushions for the hand, wrist, finger, forearm, knee, leg, etc.</p><p>Other uses include self closing or self tightening enclosures for splicing electrical and telephone cables and wires. For example, the gels can be preformed into a small diameter tubing within an outer elastic tubing, both the internal gel tubing and external elastic tubing can be axially expanded and fixed in place by a removable continuous spiral retainer. Upon insertion of a spliced pair or bundle of cables or wires, the spiral retainer can be removed, as the retainer is removed, the gel and elastic tubing impinges onto the inserted cables or wires splices, thereby sealing the electrical splices against weather, water, dirt, corrosives and shielding the splice from external abuse. The enclosure is completed without the use of heat or flame as is conventionally performed. In the case of multiblock copolymer (I) "treated" gels exhibiting delay recovery or long relaxation times and having extreme tear resistance, a tape of such a gel can be used to wrap the area of a spliced pair or bundle of cable or wire by extending the gel tape and wrapping it around the splice. The delayed recovery of the gel is important in that when the splice is fully wrapped and the gel tape end is let go, it will not quickly unravel itself. This allows time to fix in place an outer elastic shelve around the gel tape wrapped area. Thus, the gel tape will eventually fully recover around the spliced area gradually developing a strong radial recovery force about the spliced area so as to prevent the entry of water, dirt, and other contaminations. Triblock copolymer gels do not have adequate tear strength and have too rapid a recovery to allow time for placement of an outer elastic shelve.</p><p>As the treated gels and gels formed from multiblock copolymers (I) having more and more midblock polymer chains can be expected to exhibit greater delay recovery form extension or longer relaxation times with increasing number of midblocks and increasing midblock lengths, such as gels having more than three midblocks forming the copolymers (I) can exhibit extreme tear resistance and excellent tensile strength while at the same time exhibit almost liquid like properties. For example, a fun toy can be made from (S-E-EB-E-S), (S-B-EB-EB-S), (S-E-EP-E-EP-S), (S-P-EB-P-EB-S), (S-E-EB-E-EB-E-S), (S-E-EP-E-EP-E-EP-E-S), (S-E-EP-EP).sub.n, (S-B-EP-E-EP).sub.n, (S-E-EP-E-EP-E).sub.n, (S-E-EB-E-EB-E-EB-E-EB-S).sub.n copolymer gels which are molded into cube shapes when placed on the surface of a incline will collect it self together and flow down the incline as a moving body much like a volume of water moving on a high surface tension surface. This is due to the greater distance between the end block (A) domains. Such liquid like performing gels can be very strong and exhibit extreme tear resistance as exhibited by gels made from (S-E-EP-S) multiblock copolymer gels with shorter (A) distance between domains. Such liquid like gels when shaped into a cube will be deformed by the force of gravity on Earth, but will retain its memory and regain to its molded cube shape when released in outer space or reform into a cube if let loose in a container of liquid of equal density. As a comparison, such a toy formed in the shape of a large cube from a high viscosity triblock copolymer with a plasticizer content of 1:1,600 parts will be flattened by the force of gravity and run down an incline, but is very fragile and will start to tear if attempt is made to pick it up by hand. This is an excellent comparison of the difference of tear resistance difference between triblock copolymer gels and multiblock copolymer gels. A useful application is to use such an elastic liquid gel volume to fill a container or to encapsulate an electrical or electronic component in a container filling every available space, when needed, the shapeless gel volume can be removed by pouring it out of the container whole.</p><p>The most surprising, unexpected, versatile use of the composition is dental flossing. The dental floss can be almost any shape so long as it is suitable for dental flossing. A thick shaped piece of the composition can be stretched into a thin shape and used for flossing. A tinner shaped piece would require less stretching, etc. For purposes of dental flossing, while flossing between two closely adjacent teeth, especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial contact points and more especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial amalgam alloy metal contact points showing no gap between the teeth, it is critical that the gel resist tearing, shearing, and crazing while being stretched to a high degree in such situations. For example, dental gel floss can take the form of a disk where the segments of the circumference of the disk is stretched for flossing between the teeth. Other shaped articles suitable for flossing include threads, strips, yarns, tapes, etc., mentioned above.</p><p>In order for gels to be useful as a dental floss, it must overcome the difficult barriers of high shearing and high tearing under extreme elongation and tension loads. The difficulties that the gels must overcome during flossing can be viewed as follows: during the action of flossing, the gel is stretched from no less than about 200% to about 1,100% or higher the gel floss is deformed as it is pulled down with tearing action between the contacting surfaces of the teeth, then, the wedge of gel loss is sheared between the inner contacting surfaces of the teeth, and finally, the elongated wedged of gel floss is pulled upwards and out between the surfaces of the teeth. The forces encountered in the act of flossing are: tension, shearing, tearing under extreme tension.</p><p>This invention advances the flossing art by providing strong, soft, and extreme tear resistant gels made from multiblock copolymers which gels are substantially as soft as the gums surrounding the teeth.</p><p>Gel floss formed from the gels has many advantages over conventional dental floss such as regular and extra fine waxed and unwaxed nylon floss, spongy nylon fiber floss, and waxed and unwaxed expanded and unexpended teflon floss. Such conventional floss are not recommended for use by children, since a slip or sudden snap in forcing the floss between the teeth may cause injury to the gums which often times results in bleeding. For sensitive gums and inflamed gums which has become red and puffy, it is difficult to floss at, near, and below the gumline. The soft gel floss with softness substantially matching the softness of the gums are of great advantage for use by children and for flossing teeth surrounded by sensitive and tender gums.</p><p>The shear resistant characteristics of the gels can be indirectly determined by subjecting the gel to the shear forces of a pair of twisting strings and the resulting inward pulling forces of the twisting strings can be directly read off of a spring scale. As a pair of strings are gradually twisted, typical values will range from less than one pound to fifty pounds and greater. As the string is being twisted (simulating increased shearing forces), the measured pulling forces can range from a low value of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 . . . to values of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 pounds and greater.</p><p>Gel material of low strength can not resist the tremendous shearing action of the twisting strings. The twisting action of the strings can exhibit a first order twist, a second order twist, or higher order twists. A first order twist refers to one or more twists of a pair of strings (i.e. a pair of strings when twisted together forms a small tight binding helix). A second order twist refers to one or more large binding helixes build up by a par of strings that have been twisted beyond the maximum number of twist which normally produce small tight binding helixes of the first order kind. Similarly, a third order twist refers to a much larger tightly binding helix build up by the maximum number of second order twists produced by the pair of twisting strings. The third order twist may be manifested by the appearance of a branch of two or more twist of the first order twisting strings.</p><p>The order of twisting will increase (from a one, two, three, and higher order twist) until the rubber band breaks. Likewise, a looped string with one end attached to a spring scale and the other end attached to a fixed anchor can be twisted into a first, second , third, and higher ordered twist state. This method can be utilized to directly measure the force generated for each ordered twist states. The static force generated by twisting a string on a spring scale is a way of determining the shear force generated in the shearing action of forcing the gel floss between two closely contacting teeth when flossing.</p><p>In considering dental flossing criteria, one or more of the following conditions can be regarded as critical factors for dental flossing gels.</p><p>Shear Resistant Criteria</p><p>For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should withstand a twisting string shearing force of at least about 5 Kg, more advantageously at least about 8 Kg, and still more advantageously at least about 10 Kg of inward pulling force of a pair of twisting strings measured directly on a spring scale.</p><p>Flossing Cycle Criteria</p><p>For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously be able to perform at least 4 flossing cycles, more advantageously 8 cycles, and still more advantageously of about 20 cycles without breaking apart when a 3.0 mm diameter gel strand is tested on a set of simulated upper front teeth fully contacting under a uniform spring load of (0.9027 Kg) two pounds. The simulated upper front teeth comprises two small stainless steel rollers (3/8" dia.) facing lengthwise parallel and forced together so as to form a contact length of 1/2 inches under a spring load of two pounds as measured by a Entran load cell adjusted by a straight micrometer at room temperature.</p><p>Gel Strength Criteria</p><p>For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously exhibit a tensile strength of at least 5 Kg/cm.sup.2 (when extended to break as measured at 180 mandrel attached to a spring scale) and more advantageously at least 8 Kg/cm.sup.2, and still more advantageously of about 10 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher. The high and gels useful as dental floss can exhibit tensile strengths at break of at least 20 Kg/cm.sup.2, more advantageously of at least 40 Kg/cm.sup.2, and exceptionally more advantageously at least 60 Kg/cm.sup.2. Typically, the tensile strengths range from about 20 Kg/cm.sup.2 to about 110 Kg/cm2 and higher, more typically from about 30 Kg/cm.sup.2 to 80 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher, especially more typically from about 40 Kg/cm.sup.2 to about 90 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher, and exceptionally typically from about 50 Kg/cm.sup.2 to about 100 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher.</p><p>Propagating Tear Criteria</p><p>As a minimum, for the Gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously exhibit a propagating tear force (when propagating a tear as measured at 180 diameter mandrel attached to a spring scale) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 3 Kg/cm and higher. The gels useful as dental floss can exhibit tear strengths of at least 4 Kg/cm and higher, more advantageously of at least 6 Kg/cm and higher, exceptionally more advantageously of at least 8 Kg/cm and higher. Typically, the tear propagation strength can range from about 5 Kg/cm to about 20 Kg/cm and higher, more typically from about less than 5 Kg/cm to about 25 Kg/cm and higher, especially more typically from about less than 6 Kg/cm to about 30 Kg/cm and higher, and exceptionally more typically from about less than 8 Kg/cm to about 35 Kg/cm and higher.</p><p>For the Gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously exhibit a propagating tension tear force (when a cylindrical sample is notched and a tear is initiated at the notched area and propagated past its maximum cylindrical diameter by length-wise stretching of the cylindrical sample) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 4 Kg/cm and higher. The extreme tear resistant gels typically will exhibit even higher tension tear values.</p><p>Rigidity Criteria</p><p>The rigidities of the extreme tear resistant useful for flossing can advantageously range from about 350 gram to about 1,800 gram Bloom, more advantageously from about 400 gram to about 1,500 gram Bloom, especially more advantageously from about 450 gram to about 1,200 gram Bloom, still more advantageously from about 450 gram to about 1,000 gram Bloom, and less advantageously at values of greater than 1,800 gram Bloom.</p><p>In general, as a minimum, the flossing gels should exhibit several critical properties, including advantageously the ability to:</p><p>(1) withstand a shearing force of at least about 5 Kg under the string twisting test described above,</p><p>(2) perform at least 4 flossing cycles without breaking apart when tested on a set of simulated upper front teeth fully contacting under a uniform spring load of two pound,</p><p>(3) exhibit a tensile strength of at lest 5 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher,</p><p>(4) exhibit a propagating tear force at 180 least about 1 Kg/cm, and</p><p>(5) exhibit a propagating tension tear force (on a notched cylindrical sample) of at least about 1 Kg/cm.</p><p>For use as a dental floss, the gel is made (by extruding, spinning, casting, etc) as a continuous gel strand, the gel strand can be in the shape of a fiber of a selected diameter (from less than about 0.15 to about 5.0 mm and greater) as a continuous tape having a selected width and thickness (less than 0.10 mm thin to about 5.0 mm and thicker) or in any desired shape suitable for flossing. The fiber, tape or a selected shape is then cut to a desired length, rolled up and placed into a dispenser suitable for containing and dispensing a measured use amount of gel floss. The continuous fiber and tape can be partly cut or notched for measured single or multiple use. When the floss is pulled from the dispenser to a point showing the notched or cut mark on the length of gel floss, the lid is pushed down on the gel floss nipping it and allowing the floss to be further pulled and separated at the notched or cut point. Additionally, a suitable floss dispenser containing a measured length of gel floss can be fitted with a cutting edge attached to its lid or on its body and the uncut and unnotched gel gloss can be dispensed from the dispensing container and cut at the desired measured use length by pressing close the dispenser cutting edge down on the floss so as to nip and cut the gel or by simply closing the dispenser lid or running the gel along the cutting edge on the dispenser body separating a useful length of gel floss.</p><p>In practice, typically during flossing, a gel strand will under go various deformations, some of these deformations can be measured, including original shape, extended shape under tension, nipping force, and nipped deformation under a measured force and width. Typically, any shaped gel strand can be used for flossing, a square cross-section, a circular cross-section, a rectangular cross-section, round, oval, etc. For example, a 2.35 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.14 mm thickness (along a 3 mm uniform width of its cross-section) by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 16.78:1; a 1.89 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.14 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 13.5:1; a 2.75 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.19 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 14.4:1; and a 2.63 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.19 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 13.8:1. The cross-section of the gel floss can be reduced to any degree by stretching and nipping (from less than about 1% to about 1,600% and higher). Advantageously, a gel having the required strength, tear resistance, gel rigidity, and other characteristics described can be formed into a floss of any selected cross-section and thickness provided the floss is capable of being stretched when flossing under tension without breaking. Typically the stretching or pulling force is from about less than 0.1 Kg to about 3 Kg and higher. The cross-section of the strand of gel floss should be capable of being nipped by a 0.9027 Kg (2 pounds) force applied across a width of 3 mm from its original cross-sectional dimensions to a nipped thickness of about 3.0 mm to about 0.02 mm and lower, more advantageously from about 2.5 mm to about 0.04 mm and lower, still more advantageously from about 2.0 mm to about 0.08 mm and lower; especially advantageously from about 1.5 mm to about 0.15 mm and lower; especially more advantageously from about 1.2 mm to about 0.20 mm and lower; especially still more advantageously from about 1.0 mm to about 0.25 mm and lower.</p><p>The gels made from higher viscosity copolymers (I) are resistant to breaking when sheared than triblock copolymer gels. This can be demonstrated by forming a very soft gel, for example 100 parts copolymer to 800 parts plasticizing oil. The soft gel is cut into a strip of 2.5 cm in the left hand about its cross-section and an exposed part of the gel strip being gripped lengthwise around its cross-section tightly by the right hand as close to the left hand as possible without stretching. With the two hands gripping the gel strip's cross-section, the hands are moved in opposite directions to shear apart the gel strip at its cross-section. The shearing action by the gripping hands is done at the fastest speed possible as can be performed by human hands. The shearing action is performed at a fraction of a second, possible at about 0.5 seconds. Using this demonstration, the copolymer (I) gels will not easily break completely apart as would gels formed from triblock copolymers. In some cases, it will take two, three, or more attempts to shear a high viscosity copolymer (I) gel strip this way. Whereas, a lower viscosity triblock copolymer gel trip can be shared apart on the first try. For gels made from copolymers with viscosities of 5 wt % solution in Toluene, their shear resistance will decrease with decreasing viscosity. For example, the shear strengths as tested by hand shearing described above of gels made from copolymers having viscosities of 150, 120, 110, 105, 95, 90, 89, 85, 70, 60, 58, 48, 42, 40, 35, 28, 27, 25, 21 cps, and the like can be expected to decrease with decreasing viscosity.</p><p>The tensile strengths of multiblock copolymer gels made from higher viscosity copolymers (I) can be slightly lower than or equal to the tensile strengths of gels made from lower solution viscosity triblock copolymers (II).</p><p>Strands of gels comprising higher viscosity multiblock copolymers will perform better than gel strands made from gels of lower viscosity triblock copolymers when used in flossing amalgam molars and more than three times better when used in flossing front teeth.</p><p>Gels, in general, will exhibit higher tensile and greater tear resistance than their parent gels containing higher concentrations of plasticizer.</p><p>As compared to spongy nylon, regular waxed nylon, and extra fine unwaxed nylon when flossing amalgam molars, the performance of multiblock copolymer gels are on the average substantially better.</p><p>While advantageous components and formulation ranges based on the desired properties of the multiblock copolymer gels have been disclosed herein.

As the amount of oil contained in the original gel is reduced from 600 parts by weight to less than 200 parts by weight, the "reduced plasticizer volume" gels are weighted and tested.

The gels useful for flossing are characterized by low rigidities and high solution viscosity of the gels made from multiblock copolymers having two or more midblock polymer chains.</p><p>Tables 6-9 are illustrative in meeting one or more of the criteria detailed above.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 6______________________________________Illustrative Modes of Practice Contemplated formultiblock copolymer Gels   5 Wt %             Parts Number of100 Parts by   Copolymer  Styrene by Wt floss cycles                                    Samplewt      Viscosity (cps)              %       of Oil                            to break                                    No.______________________________________S-E-EP-S   90         30      300   30+     44S-E-EP-E-S   60         30      300   30+     45(S-E-EP)n   240        35      300   30+     46(S-E-EP-E)n   240        35      300   30+     47S-B-EP-S   90         30      300   30+     48S-E-EB-S   90         35      300   30+     49S-EB-EP-S   90         30      300   30+     50S-E-EP-EP-S   90         30      300   30+     51______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 7______________________________________Illustrative Modes of Practice Contemplated formultiblock copolymer Gels    5 Wt %             Parts Number  Sam-100 Parts by    Copolymer  Styrene by Wt Floss cycles                                     plewt       Viscosity (cps)               %       of Oil                             to Break                                     No.______________________________________S-E-EP-EB-S    120        33      250   30+     52S-E-EP-EP-S    120        33      250   30+     53(S-B-EP)n    380        35      250   30+     54(S-E-EB)n    380        35      250   30+     55S-E-EP-E-EP-S    120        30      250   30+     56S-E-EP-P-S    120        35      250   30+     57S-E-B-EP-S    120        30      250   30+     58S-E-EP-EP-E-S    120        30      250   30+     59______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 8______________________________________Illustrative Modes of Practice Contemplated formultiblock copolymer (0.5-2.0 cm diameters) Gel Strands     5 Wt %             Parts # Floss                                     Sam-100 Parts by     Copolymer  Styrene by Wt cycles plewt        Viscosity (cps)                %       of Oil                              to Break                                     No.______________________________________S-E-EP-S  40         30      350   30+    60S-E-EP-S  60         30      350   30+    61(S-E-EP-EB)n     340        30      350   30+    62(S-E-EP-EP-E)n     340        30      350   30+    63S-E-EP-E-EP-E-S     90         30      350   30+    64S-EB-EP-EP-S     90         35      350   30+    65S-B-EB-B-S     90         30      350   30+    66S-E-EP-EP-E-S     90         30      350   30+    67______________________________________</pre></p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 9______________________________________Illustrative Modes of Practice Contemplated formultiblock copolymer (0.5-2.0 cm diameters) Gel Strands    5 Wt %             Parts # Floss100 Parts by    Copolymer  Styrene by Wt cycles Samplewt       Viscosity (cps)               %       of Oil                             to Break                                    No.______________________________________S-E-EB-S 120        30      250   40+    68S-E-EP-S 120        30      250   40+    69(S-E-EB)n    280        35      250   40+    70(S-E-EP)n    280        35      250   40+    71S-E-EP-E-S    120        30      250   40+    72S-EP-E-EP-S    120        30      250   40+    73S-EB-E-EB-S    120        30      250   40+    74S-EB-EB-S    120        30      250   40+    75______________________________________</pre></p><p>While certain features of this invention have been described in detail with respect to various embodiments thereof, it will, of course, be apparent that other modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of this invention, and it is not intended to limit the invention to the exact details shown above except insofar as they are defined in the following claims.</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What I claim is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
