derivatives, which are antithrombotic agents, having utility in a variety of therapeutic
areas including the prevention and/or treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after
surgery, major medical illness, paralysis, malignancy, prolonged immobilisation
trauma, application of lower limb plaster casts, or fractures of the lower limbs or
pelvis; recurrent DVT; DVT during pregnancy when there is a previous history
thereof; reocclusion following thrombolytic therapy; chronic arterial obstruction;
peripheral vascular disease; acute myocardial infarction; unstable angina; atrial
fibrillation; thrombotic stroke; transient ischaemic attacks; disseminated intravascular
coagulation; coagulation in extra-corporeal circuits; occlusion of arterio-venous
shunts and blood vessel grafts (including coronary artery by-pass grafts); and
restenosis and occlusion following angioplasty. They also have utility as an adjunct
to thrombolytic therapy.</p><p num="0002">The compounds of the invention are potent and selective inhibitors of
thrombin, which is the final serine protease enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The
prime function of thrombin is the cleavage of fibrinogen to produce fibrin which forms
linear insoluble polymers which, in turn, are cross-linked by factor Xllla, itself
activated by thrombin. In addition, thrombin regulates its own production by
activation of factors V and VIII earlier in the cascade. It also has important actions
at the cellular level, where it acts on specific receptors to cause platelet aggregation,
endothelial cell activation and fibroblast proliferation. Thus thrombin has a central
regulatory role in haemostasis and thrombus formation.</p><p num="0003">Clearly then, potent, selective and orally bioavailable thrombin inhibitors
represent an attractive target for the convenient therapeutic control of
thrombosis. In addition, thrombin potently causes neurite retraction and
therefore a thrombin inhibitor is of potential therapeutic utility in the treatment of
acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the compounds 
disclosed herein are of potential value in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and
scarring, and in wound healing.</p><p num="0004">Because of their potential as substrate mimics, arginine derivatives have
been explored as thrombin inhibitors and this work led to the discovery of argatroban
(see Cardiovascular Drug Rev., 1991, <u style="single">9</u>, 247). In turn, other research groups have
sought to express the basic arginine function in alternative structures; for example,
WO-A-95/13274 discloses amidinophenylalanine and amidinopyridylalanine
derivatives as antithrombotic agents. Further variations on the theme of arginine
mimicry amongst thrombin inhibitors are represented by, <u style="single">inter</u><u style="single">alia</u>, the guanidinyl-
and amidinyl-substituted heterocyclic compounds disclosed in EP-A-0623595. In
general, however, compounds containing the basic arginine, amidine or guanidine
function have poor oral bioavailability and are poorly selective since they inhibit
trypsin as well as thrombin.</p><p num="0005">Thrombin inhibitors containing a 3-amino-2-pyridone acetamide template
have been disclosed by Corvas Int Inc in PCT patent reference WO 96/18644 and
COR Therapeutics Inc in WO 98/16547. Compounds of the type disclosed within
WO 96/18644 and WO 98/16547 contain a guanidino function as an arginine mimic
and are likely to be irreversible inhibitors of thrombin by virtue of the presence of an
aldehyde or an activated carbonyl fragment.</p><p num="0006">Thrombin inhibitors containing a 3-amino-2-pyridone or pyrazinone acetamide
fragment and an arginine mimic which is not a guanidine or amidine have been
disclosed by Merck in PCT patent reference WO 97/40024, WO 97/01338, WO
97/30708, WO 98/09987, WO 99/11267 and in Bioorg Med Chem Letters. 1997, 7,
p1497; 1998, 8, p1719, 1998, 8, p817.</p><p num="0007">The present inventors have now found a class of non basic or weakly basic
bicyclic heterocyclic arginine mimics which are highly potent, selective, reversible
thrombin inhibitors with good oral bioavailability. </p><p num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention provides compound of formula (I):
