Materials and methods are provided for treating disease states, including cancer
and autoimmune disease, by facilitating or inhibiting the migration or
activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. In particular, chemokines are
used to initiate, amplify or modulate an immune response. In one
emodiment, chemokines are used to attract dentritic cells to the site of antigen
delivery. An increase number of dendritic at the site of antigen delivery means
more antigen uptake and a modified immune response.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><heading><u style="single">Field Of The Invention</u></heading><p num="0001">The invention relates to the use of human chemokines in the treatment
of disease states, including cancer. The administered chemokines direct the
migration of either all antigen-presenting dendritic cells or a specific subset of
dentritic cells. In one embodiment, disease-specific antigen(s) and/or a moiety
designed to activate dentritic cells is administered in conjunction with the
chemokine(s).</p><heading><u style="single">Background Of The Invention</u></heading><p num="0002">Dendritic cells (DC) specialize in the uptake of antigen and their
presentation to T cells. DC thus play a critical role in antigen-specific immune
responses.</p><p num="0003">DC are represented by a diverse population of morphologically similar
cell types distributed widely throughout the body in a variety of lymphoid and
non-lymphoid tissues (Caux, <i>et al</i>., 1995, <i>Immunology Today</i><b>16</b>:2; Steinman,
1991, <i>Ann</i>. <i>Rev</i>. <i>Immunol</i>. <b>9</b>:271-296). These cells include lymphoid DC of the
spleen, Langerhans cells of the epidermis, and veiled cells in the blood
circulation. DC are collectively classified as a group based on their morphology,
high levels of surface MHC-class II expression as well as several accessory
molecules (B7-1[CD80] and B7-2[CD86]) that mediate T cell binding and
costimulation (Inaba, <i>et al</i>., 1990, <i>Intern</i>. <i>Rev. Immunol</i>. <b>6</b>:197-206 ; Frendenthal,
<i>et al</i>., 1990, <i>Proc</i>. <i>Natl</i>. <i>Acad. Sci</i>. USA <b>87</b>:7698), and absence of certain other
surface markers expressed on T cells, B cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells.</p><p num="0004">DC are bone marrow-derived and migrate as precursors through blood
stream to tissues, where they become resident cells such as Langerhans cells in
the epidermis. </p><p num="0005">In the periphery, following pathogen invasion, immature DC such as
fresh Langerhans cells are recruited at the site of inflammation (Kaplan, <i>et al</i>.,
1992, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>175</b>:1717-1728; McWilliam, <i>et al</i>., 1994, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>179</b>:1331-1336)
where they capture and process antigens, (Inaba, <i>et al</i>., 1986. <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>164</b>:605-613; Streilein, <i>et al</i>., 1989, <i>J. Immunol</i>. <b>143</b>:3925-3933; Romani, <i>et al</i>.,
1989., <i>J Exp. Med.</i><b>169</b>:1169-1178; Puré, <i>et al</i>., 1990. <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>172</b>:1459-1469;
Schuler, <i>et al</i>., 1985, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>161</b>:526-546).</p><p num="0006">Antigen-loaded DC then migrate from the peripheral tissue via the
lymphatics to the T cell rich area of lymph nodes, where the mature DC are
called interdigitating cells (IDC) (Austyn, <i>et al</i>., 1988, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>167</b>:646-651;
Kupiec-Weglinski, <i>et al</i>., 1988, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>167</b>:632-645; Larsen, <i>et al</i>., 1990, <i>J. Exp.
Med</i>. <b>172</b>:1483-1494; Fossum, S. 1988, <i>Scand. J. Immunol</i>. <b>27</b>:97-105; Macatonia, <i>et
al</i>., 1987, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>166</b>:1654-1667; Kripke, <i>et al</i>., 1990., <i>J. Immunol</i>. <b>145</b>:2833-2838).
At this site, they present the processed antigens to naive T cells and
generate an antigen-specific primary T cell response (Liu, <i>et al</i>., 1993, <i>J. Exp.
Med</i>. <b>177</b>:1299-1307; Sornasse, <i>et al</i>, 1992, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>175</b>:15-21; Heufler, <i>et al.,</i>
1988. , <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>167</b>:700-705).</p><p num="0007">During their migration from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs, DC
undergo a maturation process encompassing dramatic changes in phenotype
and functions (Larsen, <i>et al.,</i> 1990, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>172</b>:1483-1494; Streilein, <i>et al.,</i>
1990, <i>Immunol. Rev</i>. <b>117</b>:159-184; De Smedt, <i>et al.,</i> 1996, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>184</b>:1413-1424).
In particular, in contrast to immature DC such as fresh Langerhans cells,
which capture and process soluble proteins efficiently and are effective at
activating specific memory and effector T cells, mature DC such as IDC of
lymphoid organs are poor in antigen capture and processing but markedly
efficient in naive T cell priming (Inaba, <i>et al.,</i> 1986. <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>164</b>:605-613;
Streilein, <i>et al.,</i> 1989, <i>J. Immunol</i>. <b>143</b>:3925-3933; Romani, <i>et al.,</i> 1989, <i>J. Exp.

1995, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>182</b>:389-400; Cella, <i>et al.,</i> 1997, <i>Current Opin. Immunol</i>. <b>9</b>:10-16).</p><p num="0008">Signals regulating the traffic pattern of DC are complex and not fully
understood. </p><p num="0009">Signals provided by TNFα and LPS are known to induce <i>in vivo</i>
migration of resident DC from the tissues to the draining lymphoid organs (De
Smedt, <i>et al.,</i> 1996. <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>184</b>:1413-1424; MacPherson, <i>et al.,</i> 1995, <i>J.

<i>Immunology</i>. <b>84</b>:31-35),</p><p num="0010">Chemokines are small molecular weight proteins that regulate leukocyte
migration and activation (Oppenheim, 1993, <i>Adv. Exp. Med</i>. <i>Biol.</i><b>351</b>:183-186;
Schall, <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol</i>. <b>6</b>:865-873; Rollins, 1997, <i>Blood</i><b>90</b>:909-928;
Baggiolini, <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>Adv. Immunol</i>. <b>55</b>:97-179). They are secreted by
activated leukocytes themselves, and by stromal cells including endothelial
cells and epithelial cells upon inflammatory stimuli (Oppenheim, 1993, <i>Adv</i>.
<i>Exp. Med. Biol</i>. <b>351</b>:183-186; Schall, <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol</i>. <b>6</b>:865-873;
Rollins, 1997, <i>Blood</i><b>90</b>:909-928; Baggiolini, <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>Adv. Immunol</i>. <b>55</b>:97-179).
Responses to chemokines are mediated by seven transmembrane
spanning G-protein-coupled receptors (Rollins, 1997, <i>Blood</i><b>90</b>:909-928; Premack,
<i>et al.,</i> 1996, <i>Nat. Med.</i><b>2</b>:1174-1178; Murphy, P.M. 1994, <i>Ann. Rev. Immunol.</i><b>12</b>:593-633). Several chemokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3,
MCP-4, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES
(regualted on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), SDF-1, Teck
(thymus expressed chemokine) and MDC (marcrophage derived chemokine)
have been reported to attract DC <i>in vitro</i> (Sozzani, <i>et al.,</i> 1995, <i>J. Immunol.</i><b>155</b>:3292-3295; Sozzani, <i>et al.,</i> 1997, <i>J. Immunol</i>. <b>159</b>:1993-2000; Xu, <i>et al.,</i> 1996, <i>J</i>.
<i>Leukoc. Biol</i>. <b>60</b>:365-371; MacPherson, <i>et al.,</i> 1995, <i>J. Immunol</i>. <b>154</b>:1317-1322;
Roake, <i>et al.,</i> 1995, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>181</b>:2237-2247).</p><p num="0011">In recent years, investigators have attempted to exploit the activity of DC
in the treatment of cancer. In an animal model, as few as 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> antigen-pulsed
DC will induce immunity when injected into naive mice (Inaba <i>at al</i>., 1990,
<i>Intern. Rev. Immunol.</i><b>6</b>:197-206). Flamand <i>et al</i>. (<i>Eur. J. Immunol</i>., 1994,
<b>24</b>:605-610) pulsed mouse DC with the idiotype antigen from a B-cell lymphoma
and injected them into naive mice. This treatment effectively protected the
recipient mice from subsequent tumor challenges and established a state of
lasting immunity. Injection of antigen alone, or B cells pulsed with antigen,
had no effect, suggesting that it was the unique characteristics of DC that were 
responsible for the anti-tumor response. It has been postulated that DC are not
only capable of inducing anti-tumor immunity, but that they are absolutely
essential for this process to occur (Ostrand-Rosenberg, 1994, <i>Current Opinion in
Immunol</i>. <b>6</b>:722-727; Grabbe <i>et al.,</i> 1995, <i>Immunol. Today</i><b>16</b>:117-120; Huang <i>et
al</i>., 1994, <i>Science</i><b>264</b>:961-965). Huang and coworkers (Huang <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>Science</i><b>264</b>:961-965) inoculated mice with a B7-1 transfected tumor that was known to
produce anti-tumor immunity. They demonstrated that only mice with MHC-compatible
APC were capable of rejecting a tumor challenge. Studies in
humans have demonstrated a similar role for DC. It has been reported that
peptide-specific CTL are readily induced from purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells using
peptide-pulsed DC, but are not elicited when peptide-pulsed monocytes are
used (Mehta-Damani <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>J. Immunology</i><b>153</b>:996-1003).</p><p num="0012">Of significant clinical interest the histologic infiltration of dendritic cells
into primary tumor lesions has been associated with significantly prolonged
patient survival and a reduced incidence of metastatic disease in patients with
bladder, lung, esophageal, gastric and nasopharygeal carcinoma. In contrast, a
comparatively poorer clinical prognosis is observed for patients with lesions
that exhibit a sparse infiltration with DC and metastatic lesions are frequently
deficient in DC infiltration (Becker, 1993, <i>In Vivo</i><b>7</b>:187; Zeid <i>et al.,</i> 1993,
<i>Pathology</i><b>25</b>:338; Furihaton <i>et al.,</i> 1992, <b>61</b>:409; Tsujitani <i>et al.,</i> 1990, <i>Cancer</i><b>66</b>:2012; Gianni <i>et al.,</i> 1991, <i>Pathol. Res. Pract</i>. <b>187</b>:496; Murphy <i>et al.,</i> 1993, <i>J. Inv.
Dermatol</i>. <b>100</b>:3358). A patient with advanced B-cell lymphoma was recently
treated with DC pulsed with the patient's own tumor idiotype (Hsu <i>et al.,</i> 1996,
<i>Nature Medicine</i><b>2</b>(<b>1</b>):52). This produced a measurable reduction in the
patient's B-cell lymphoma. Treatment of prostate cancer using DC pulsed with
PSM antigen has been reported by Murphy <i>et al.,</i> (<i>The Prostate</i> 1996 <b>29</b>:371).</p><p num="0013">Techniques have recently emerged for the <i>in vitro</i> propagation of large
numbers of DC from circulating monocytes or from CD34 hematopoietic
progenitors in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) in combination with either interleukin 4 (IL-4) or tissue necrosis
factor α (TNFα) (Sallusto <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>179</b>:1109-1118; Romani <i>et al.,</i>
1994, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>180</b>:83-93: Caux <i>et al.,</i> 1992, <i>Nature</i><b>360</b>:258). The combination
of GM-CSF and IL-4 induces peripheral blood monocytes to differentiate into
potent DC (Kiertscher and Roth, 1996, <i>J. Leukocyte Biol</i>. <b>59</b>:208-281). With the 
combination of these two cytokines a 100-fold increase in the yield of DC can be
achieved from peripheral blood <i>in vitro</i>.</p><p num="0014">In mice, tumor antigen-loaded <i>in vitro</i> generated DC have been shown,
by various groups, to prevent the development of tumors and more
importantly to induce the regression of established tumors. A clinical trial has
been conducted in which patients with melanoma are being treated with GM-CSF-activated
APC pulsed with a peptide from the MAGE-1 tumor antigen
(Mehta-Damani, <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>J. Immunology</i><b>153</b>:996-1003). Pre-immunization,
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from two patients were predominantly CD4<sup>+</sup>
and lacked specific tumor reactivity. In contrast, after immunization tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes from the same patients were predominantly CD8<sup>+</sup> and
demonstrated MAGE-1 specific anti-tumor cytotoxicity. It thus appears from
these studies that DC have a unique and potent capacity to stimulate immune
responses.</p><p num="0015">Dendritic cell therapy thus represents a very promising approach to the
treatment of disease, in particular, cancer. There is a continuing need for
improved materials and methods that can be used not only to expand and
activate antigen presenting dendritic cells, but to facilitate the migration of DC
so as to be both therapeutically as well as prophylactically useful.</p><heading><u style="single"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></u></heading><p num="0016">The present invention fulfills the foregoing need by providing materials
and methods for treating disease states by facilitating or inhibiting the
migration or activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. It has now been
discovered that chemokines are useful therapeutic agents. Disease states which
can be treated in accordance with the invention include parasitic infections,
bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, cancer, autoimmune
dieseases, graft rejection and allergy.</p><p num="0017">The invention provides a method of treating disease states comprising
administering to an individual in need thereof an amount of chemokine
sufficient to increase the migration of immature dendritic cells to the site of
antigen delivery. In one aspect of the invention a chemokine such as MIP-3α,
MIP-1α and RANTES, or a combination thereof is administered. In a preferred 
method of the invention, a disease-associated antigen, such as a tumor-associated
antigen is administered in conjunction with the chemokine.</p><p num="0018">Another aspect of the invention provides a method of treating disease
states comprising administering to an individual in need thereof an amount of
chemokine sufficient to decrease the migration of immature dendritic cells to
the site of antigen delivery.</p><p num="0019">In still another aspect of the invention, cytokines, in particular GM-CSF
and IL-4 are administrered in combination, either before or concurently, with
the chemokine. Administration of GM-CSF and IL-4 stimulates generation of
DC from precursors, thereby increasing the number of DC available to capture
and process antigen.</p><p num="0020">Yet another aspect of the invention an activating agent such as TNF-α is
administered to provide maturation signals which drives the migration of DC
from tissues toward lypmph organs vessels to the draining lymph.</p><heading><u style="single"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></u></heading><p num="0021"><sl><li>Figure 1 shows that immunization with a plasmid encoding a
chemokine and a tumor-associated antigen has a protective effect against tumor
engraftment.</li><li>Figure 2 shows that greater CTL activeity with the administration of a

responses to chemokines was heretofore not known. The inventors have
discovered that the pattern of chemokine receptors expressed by DC change
according to their stage of maturation and that chemokines can be used to drive
migration of DC subsets and thereby control the initiation of the immune
response. Chemokines can be used in accordance with the invention as 
adjuvants to attract selectively the immature DC subsets at the site of antigen
delivery. In the context of autoimmune disease, tissue rejection or allergy, the
invention provides a method of blocking DC functions by interfering with their
migration through e.g., the development of CCR6 and CCR7 antagonists.</p><p num="0024">Depending on the subset of DC presenting the antigen to the immune
system, the response could vary dramatically. DC can induce tolerance. DC
found in the medulla of the thymus play a role in the negative selection of
developing self-reactive thymocytes (Brocker, <i>et al.,</i> 1997, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>185</b>(3):541-550).
DC can also tolerize self-reactive peripheral T cells (Kurts, <i>et al</i>., 1997, <i>J</i>.
<i>Exp. Med</i>. <b>186</b>(2):239-245; Adler, <i>et al</i>., 1998, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>187</b>(10):1555-1564). A
specific subset of mouse DC, possibly of lymphoid origin, has been proposed to
induce immune tolerance (Ardavin, 1993, <i>Nature</i><b>362</b>(6422):761-763).
Furthermore, the recent description that the candidate human counterpart to
the lymphoid DC (the DC-2) (Grouard, <i>et al.,</i> 1997, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>185</b>(6):1101-1111)
cannot secrete IL-12 suggests that, following presentation by this subpopulation,
the immune response might be biased towards a TH-2 type.</p><p num="0025">When the goal is to decrease the immune response, tolerizing DC
(autoimmunity, allergy) are recruited, or the quality of the response is modified
by recruiting specifically DC-2 (TH1 greater that TH2, i.e., in allergy).</p><p num="0026">A chemokine for use in the invention is a natural protein of the body
that is active on a restricted subset of DC, in particular, immature DC. Several
of these cytokines, including MIP-3α, Teck, DCtactin-β and MCP-4, have been
identified by the inventors.</p><p num="0027">The chemokine used in practicing the invention may be a recombinant
protein with an amino-acid sequence identical to the natural product, or a
recombinant protein derived from the natural product but including
modifications that changes its pharmacokinetic properties while keeping its 
original chemoattractant property. The mode of delivery of the chemokine
may be by injection, including intradermal, intramuscular and subcutaneous,
or topical, such as an ointment or a patch.</p><p num="0028">The chemokine may also be delivered as a nucleic add sequence by the
way of a vector, such as a viral vector (e.g., adenovirus, poxvirus, retrovirus,
lentivirus), or an engineered plasmid DNA.</p><p num="0029">The term "chemokine" as used herein includes chemotactic agents. A
chemotactic agent may be a small chemical compound which is a selective
agonist of a chemokine receptor expressed by immature DC. CCR6, the natural
receptor the the chemokine MIP-3α is an example of such a receptor.</p><p num="0030">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the chemokine
is administered with a disease-associated antigen. The antigen can be any
molecular moiety against which an increase or decrese in immune response is
sought. This includes antigens derived from organisms known to cause
diseases in man or animal such as bacteria, viruses, parasites (e.g., <i>Leishmania</i>)
and fungi. This also includes antigens expressed by tumors (tumor-associated
antigens) and plant antigens (allergens).</p><p num="0031">Tumor associated antigens for use in the invention include, but are not
limited to Melan-A, tyrosinase, p97, β-HCG, GalNAc, MAGE-1, MAGE-2,
MAGE-3, MAGE-4, MAGE-12, MART-1, MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC18,
CEA, DDC, melanoma antigen gp75, HKer 8, high molecular weight melanoma
antigen, K19, Tyr1 and Tyr2, members of the pMel 17 gene family, c-Met, PSA,
PSM, α -fetoprotein, thyroperoxidase, gp100 and p53. This list is not intended to
be exhaustive, but merely exemplary of the types of antigen which may be used
in the practice of the invention.</p><p num="0032">Different combinations of antigens may be used that show optimal
function with different ethnic groups, sex, geographic distributions, and stage of
disease. In one embodiment of the invention at least two or more different
antigens are administered in conjunction with the administration of
chemokine. </p><p num="0033">The antigen can by delivered or administered at the same site and the
same time as the chemokine, or after a delay not exceeding 48 hours.
Concurrent or combined administration, as used herein means the chemokine
and antigen are administered to the subject either (a) simultaneously in time.
or (b) at different times during the course of a common treatment schedule. In
the latter case, the two compounds are administered sufficiently close in time to
achieve the intended effect. The antigen can be in the form of a protein, or one
or several peptides, or of a nucleic acid sequence included in a delivery vector.</p><p num="0034">Both primary and metastatic cancer can be treated in accordance with the
invention. Types of cancers which can be treated include but are not limited to
melanoma, breast, pancreatic, colon, lung, glioma, hepatocellular, endometrial,
gastric, intestinal, renal, prostate, thyroid, ovarian, testicular, liver, head and
neck, colorectal, esophagus, stomach, eye, bladder, glioblastoma, and metastatic
carcinomas. The term "carcinoma" refers to malignancies of epithelial or
endocrine tissues including respiratory system carcinomas, gastrointestinal
system carcinomas, genitourinary system carcinomas, prostatic carcinomas,
endocrine system carcinomas, and melanomas. Metastatic, as this term is used
herein, is defined as the spread of tumor to a site distant to regional lymph
nodes.</p><p num="0035">A moiety designed to activate, induce or stimulate maturity of the DC
may be advantageously administered. Such agents provide maturation signals
which promote migration from the tissues to the lymph nodes. This moiety
can be a natural product of the body such as TNF-α or RP-105, or an agonist
antibody recongnizing a specific structure on DC such as an anti-CD-40
antibody, or another substance. The activating substance can be a sequence of
nucleic acids containing unmethylated CpG motifs known to stimulate DC. In
the embodiment of the invention where the chemokine and/or antigen is
delivered by the means of a plasmid vector, these nucleic acid sequences may be
part of the vector.</p><p num="0036">GM-CSF and IL-4 can advantageous be administered in combination with
the chemokine and/or antigen. The administration combination of GM-CSF 
and IL-4 stimulates generation of DC from precursors. GM-CSF and IL-4 may
be administered for purposes of increasing the number of circulating immature
DC which might then be locally recruited locally be the subsequent injection of
chemokine(s). This protocol would imply a systemic pre-treatment for a least
five to seven days with GM-CSF and IL-4. An alternative would be to favor by
local administration of GM-CSF and IL-4 the local differentiation of DC-precursors
(monocytes) into immature DC which could then pick up the
antigen delivered at the same site.</p><p num="0037">Generally, chemokine(s) and/or antigen(s) and/or activating agent(s)
and/or cytokine(s) are administered as pharmaceutical compositions
comprising an effective amount of chemokine(s) and/or antigen(s) and/or
activating agent(s) and/or cytokine(s) in a pharmaceutical carrier. These
reagents can be combined for therapeutic use with additional active or inert
ingredients, e.g., in conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or
diluents, e.g., immunogenic adjuvants, along with physiologically innocuous
stabilizers and excipients. A pharmaceutical carrier can be any compatible, non-toxic
substance suitable for delivering the compositions of the invention to a
patient.</p><p num="0038">The quantities of reagents necessary for effective therapy will depend
upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site,
physiological state of the patient, and other medicants administered. Thus,
treatment dosages should be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. Animal
testing of effective doses for treatment of particular cancers will provide further
predictive indication of human dosage. Various considerations are described,
e.g., in Gilman <i>et al.,</i> (eds.) (1990) <i>Goodman and Gilman's: The Pharmacological
Bases of Therapeutics</i>, 8th Ed., Pergamon Press; and <i>Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences</i>, 17th ed. (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA.
Methods for administration are discussed therein and below, e.g., for
intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intramuscular administration, transdermal
diffusion, and others. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers will include water,
saline, buffers, and other compounds described, e.g., in the <i>Merck Index</i>, Merck 
&amp; Co., Rahway, New Jersey. Slow release formulations, or a slow release
apparatus may be used for continuous administration.</p><p num="0039">Dosage ranges for chemokine(s) and/or antigen(s) and/or activating
agent(s) would ordinarily be expected to be in amounts lower than 1 mM
concentrations, typically less than about 10 µM concentrations, usually less than
about 100 nM, preferably less than about 10 pM (picomolar), and most
preferably less than about 1 fM (femtomolar), with an appropriate carrier.
Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller doages which are less than the
optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small
increments until the optimum effect under the circumstance is reached.
Determination of the proper dosage and administration regime for a particular
situation is within the skill of the art.</p><p num="0040">The preferred biologically active dose of GM-CSF and IL-4 in the practice
of the claimed invention is that dosing combination which will induce
maximum increase in the number of circulating CD14<sup>+</sup>/CD13<sup>+</sup> precursor cells;
the expression of antigen presenting molecules on the surface of DC precursors
and mature DC; antigen presenting activity to T cells; and/or stimulation of
antigen-dependent T cell response consistent with mature DC function. In the
practice of the invention the amount of IL-4 to be used for subcutaneously
administration typically ranges from about 0.05 to about 8.0µg/kg/day,
preferably 0.25 - 6.0 µg/kg/day, most preferably 0.50 - 4.0 µg/kg/day. The
amount of GM-CSF is to be used for subcutaneous administration typically
ranges from about 0.25µg/kg/day to about 10.0 µg/kg/day, preferably from about
1.0 - 8.0 µg/kg/day, most preferably 2.5 - 5.0µg/kg/day. An effective amount for
a particular patient can be established by measuring a significant change in one
or more of the parameters indicated above. </p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p num="0041">The invention can be illustrated by way of the following non-limiting
examples, which can be more easily understood by reference to the following
materials and methods.
<sl><li><i>Hematopoietic factors</i>, <i>reagents and cell lines</i>. Recombinant GM-CSF (specific
activity: 2.10<sup>6</sup> U/mg, Schering-Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ) was
used at a saturating concentration of 100 ng/ml. Recombinant human TNFα
(specific activity: 2x10<sup>7</sup> U/mg, Genzyme, Boston, MA) was used at an optimal
concentration of 2.5 ng/m. Recombinant human SCF (specific activity 4x10<sup>5</sup>
U/mg, R&amp;D Abington, UK) was used at an optimal concentration of 25 ng/ml.
Recombinant human IL-4 (specific activity: 2.10<sup>7</sup> U/mg, Schering-Plough
Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ) was used at a saturating concentration of
50 U/ml. Recombinant human chemokines MIP-1α (specific activity: 2x10<sup>5</sup>
U/mg, 9x10<sup>12</sup> U/M), RANTES (specific activity: 1x10<sup>4</sup> U/mg, 8x10<sup>10</sup> U/M), MIP-3α
(specific activity: 4x10<sup>5</sup> U/mg, 3x10<sup>12</sup> U/M) and MIP-3β (specific activity:
1x10<sup>4</sup> U/mg, 9x10<sup>10</sup> U/M) were obtained trough R&amp;D (Abington, UK). LPS
was used at 10 ng/ml (Sigma).
The murine CD40 ligand transfected cell line (CD40-L L cells) was used as
stimulator of DC maturation.</li><li><i>Generation of DC from cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC</i>. Umbilical cord blood samples
were obtained following full term delivery. Cells bearing CD34<sup>+</sup> antigen were
isolated from mononuclear fractions through positive selection as described
(Caux, <i>et al.,</i> 1996, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>184</b>:695-706; Caux, <i>et al.,</i> 1990, <i>Blood</i>. <b>75</b>:2292-2298),
using anti-CD34<sup>+</sup> monoclonal antibody (Immu-133.3, Immunotech
Marseille, France), goat anti mouse IgG coated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec
GmBH, Bergish Gladbach, Germany) and Minimacs separation columns
(Miltenyi Biotec). In all experiments the isolated cells were 80% to 99% CD34<sup>+</sup>.
After purification, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were cryopreserved in 10% DMSO.
Cultures were established in the presence of SCF, GM-CSF and TNFα as
described (Caux, <i>et al.,</i> 1996, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>184</b>:695-706) in endotoxin-free medium
consisting of RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Techniques, France, 
Irvine, UK), 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5x10<sup>-5</sup> M β-mercaptoethanol,
100 µg/ml gentamicin (Schering-Plough, Levallois, France) (referred to as
complete medium). After thawing, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were seeded for expansion in
25 to 75 cm<sup>2</sup> culture vessels (Linbro, ICN Biomedicals, Acron, OH) at 2x10<sup>4</sup>
cells/ml. Optimal conditions were maintained by splitting these cultures at
day 5 and 10 with medium containing fresh GM-CSF and TNFα (cell
concentration: 1-3x10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml). At day 12, between 70 to 90% of the cells are
CD1a<sup>+</sup> DC.</li><li><i>Isolation of immature and mature DC according to CD86 expression by FACS-sorting</i>.
After 12 days of culture in presence of GM-CSF and TNFα, cells were
collected and labelled with FITC-conjugated OKT6 (CD1a) (Ortho Diagnosis
System, Raritan, NJ) and PE-conjugated IT2.2 (CD86) (Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA). Cells were separated according to CD1a and CD86 expression into
immature CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>-</sup>, and mature CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> DC populations using a
FACStarplus® (laser setting: power 250 mW, excitation wavelength 488 nm,
Becton-Dickinson, Sunnyvale. CA). All the procedures of staining and sorting
were performed in presence of 0.5 mM EDTA in order to avoid cell
aggregation. Reanalysis of the sorted populations showed a purity &gt; 98%.</li><li><i>Generation of DC from peripheral blood monocytes</i>. Monocytes were purified
by immunomagnetic depletion (Dynabeads, Dynal Oslo, Norway) after
preparation of PBMC followed by a 52% Percoll gradient. The depletion was
performed with anti-CD3 (OKT3), anti-CD19 (4G2), anti-CD8 (OKT8), anti-CD56
(NKH1, Coulter Corporation, Hialeah, FL) and anti-CD16 (ION16, Immunotech)
monoclonal antibodies. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells were produced by
culturing purified monocytes for 6-7 days in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4
(Sallusto, <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>179</b>:1109-1118).</li><li><i>Induction of maturation of in vitro generated DC</i>. CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC were cultured
until day 6 in presence of GM-CSF+TNFα and in presence of GM-CSF alone
from day 6 to day 12 in order to preserve their immaturity. Immature DC from
CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC or monocyte-derived DC were activated for 3h to 72h in presence of
TNFα (2.5 ng/ml) or LPS (10 ng/ml) or CD40L transfected L cells (1 L cells for 5
DC) as described (Caux, <i>et al.,</i> 1994, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>180</b>:1263-1272). </li><li><i>Purification of CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC from peripheral blood or tonsils</i>. CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC were
prepared as previously described from peripheral blood or tonsils (Grouard, <i>et
al</i>., 1996, <i>Nature</i><b>384</b>:364-367). Briefly, tonsils obtained from children
undergoing tonsillectomy were finely minced and digested with collagenase IV
and DNase I (Sigma). The collected cells were centrifuged through Ficoll-Hypaque
with SRBC (BioMérieux, Lyon, France) for 15 min at 500 rpm, then for
30 min at 2000 rpm. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated
by Ficoll-Hypaque. CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (OKT3), CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells (4G7), and CD14<sup>+</sup>
monocytes (MOP9) were removed from the resulting low density cells by
magnetic beads (anti-mouse Ig-coated Dynabeads, Dynal). A second depletion
was performed with anti-NKH1, anti-glycophorine A (Immunotech) and anti-CD20
(1F54). The remaining cells were stained with the following mAbs: anti-CD1a
FITC (OKT6); anti-CD14 FITC, anti-CD57 FITC, anti-CD16 FITC, anti-CD7
FITC, anti-CD20 FITC, anti-CD3 FITC (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA);
anti-CD4 PE-Cy5 (Immunotech) and anti-CD11c PE (Becton Dickinson).
CD4<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>lineage<sup>-</sup> DC were isolated by cell sorting using a FACStarPlus®
(laser setting: power 250 mW, excitation wavelength 488 nm). All the
procedures of depletion, staining and sorting were performed in presence of 0.5
mM EDTA. Reanalysis of the sorted population showed a purity &gt; 97%.</li><li><i>Chemotaxis assay</i>. Cell migration was evaluated using a chemotaxis
microchamber technique (48-well Boyden microchamber, Neuroprobe,
Pleasanton, CA) (Bacon, <i>et al.,</i> 1988. <i>Br</i>. <i>J. Pharmacol</i>. <b>95</b>:966-974). Briefly,
human recombinant MIP-3α and MIP-3β, MIP-1α and RANTES were diluted to
concentrations ranging from 1 ng/ml to 1000 ng/ml in RPMI 1640 medium,
and were added to the lower wells of the chemotaxis chamber. 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well (or
5x10<sup>4</sup> cells/well for CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC) in 50µl of RPMI 1640 medium were applied to
the upper wells of the chamber, with a standard 5-µm pore
polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter (Neuroprobe) separating the
lower wells. The chamber was incubated at 37°C in humidified air with 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> for 1h. Then, cells which had migrated to the underside of the filter were
stained with Field's A and Field's B (BDH, Dorcet, England) and counted using
an image analyser (software: Vision Explorer and ETC 3000, Graphtek,
Mirmande, France) in two randomly selected low power fields (magification
x20). Each assay was performed in duplicate and the results were expressed as
the mean ± SD of migrating cells per 2 fields. </li><li><i>Extraction of total RNA and Synthesis of cDNA</i>. Cells were prepared as
described above, and total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium thiocyanate
method as mentioned by the manufacturer (RNAgents total RNA isolation
system, Promega). After DNAse I (RQ1 RNAse free DNAse, Promega)
treatement, RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and the quality was
evaluated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde denaturing conditions. First
strand cDNA was synthetized from total RNA extracted in RNAse-free
conditions. The reaction was performed with 5 µg of total RNA, 25 ng/µl oligo
dT<sub>12-18</sub> primers (Pharmacia, Orsay, France) and the Superscript kit (SuperScript
II RNase H<sup>-</sup> Reverse Transcripase, Gibco BRL), as described by the
manufacturer. For all samples, synthesis of cDNA was controlled and
calibrated by RT-PCR using β-actin primers for 21 cycles.</li><li><i>RT-PCR analysis</i>. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed in a Perkin Elmer
9600 thermal cycler, in a final volume of 100 µl reaction mixture containing 2.5
U AmpliTaq enzyme (5U/µl, Perkin Elmer, Paris, France) with its 1X buffer, 0.2
mM of each dNTP (Perkin Elmer, Paris, France), 5% DMSO, and 1 µM of each
forward and reverse primers. CCR6 (Accession No. Z79784) and CCR7
(Accession No. L08176) primers were designed within regions of lowest
homology between the chemokine receptors. +80/CCR6
5'- ATTTCAGCGATGTTTTCGACTC -3' forward primer, -1081/CCR6
5'- GGAGAAGCCTGAGGACTTGTA -3' reverse primer, +154/CCR7
5'- GATTACATCGGAGACAACACC -3' forward primer and -1202/CCR7
5'- TAGTCCAGGCAGAAGAGTCG -3' reverse primer were used for RT-PCR
and sequencing. For both chemokine receptors, the reaction mixture was
subjected to 30 and 35 cycles of PCR with the following conditions : 94°C for 1
min, 61.5°C for 2 min and 72°C for 3 min. PCR products were visualized on
1.2% agarose gels containing 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide. Reaction products
migrating at the predicted size (1,021 bp for CCR6 and 1,067 bp for CCR7) were
gel purified and subcloned into pCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Leek, The
Netherlands) for sequencing verification on an ABI 373A Sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA.) using dye terminator technology. Two other
oligonucleotides, -622/CCR6 5'- GCTGCCTTGGGTGTTGTATTT -3' and
+662/CCR7 5'- AGAGGAGCAGCAGTGAGCAA -3', were used as probes for 
hybridization with the PCR products separated on 1.2% agarose gel and blotted
onto Hybond N<sup>+</sup> membranes (Amersham, Les Ulis, France).</li><li><i>Calcium fluorimetry</i>. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was measured using the
fluorescent probe Indo-1, according to the technique reported by Grynkiewicz <i>et
al</i>. (<i>J. Biol. Chem</i>., 1985, <b>260</b>:3440-3450) Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and
resuspended at 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium (see above). Then,
cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with 3 µg/ml Indo-1 AM
(Molecular Probes) in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed and
resuspended in HBSS/1% FCS at 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. Before measurement of
intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, cells were diluted 10 fold in HBSS/10 mM
Hepes/1.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> preheated at 39°C. Samples were excited at 330 nm with
continous stiring and the Indo-1 fluorescence was measured as a function of
time at 405 nm (dye is complexed with Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and 485 nm (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium),
in a 810 Photomultiplier Detection System (software: Felix, Photon Technology
International, Monmouth Junction, NJ). Results are expressed as the ratio of
values obtained at the two emission wavelengths.</li><li><i>In situ hybridization</i>. <i>In situ</i> hybridization was performed as described
(Peuchmaur, <i>et al.,</i> 1990, <i>Am. J. Pathol</i>. <b>136</b>:383-390). Two couple primers were
used for amplifying by RT-PCR the majority of the open reading frame of MIP-3α
(Accession No. D86955) and MIP-3β 3α (Accession No. U77180) genes.
+77/MIP-3α5'- TTGCTCCTGGCTGCTTTG -3' forward primer and -425/MIP-3α
5'- ACCCTCCATGATGTGCAAG -3' reverse primer, +25/MIP-3β
5'- CTGCTGGTTCTCTGGACTTC -3' forward primer and -439/MIP-3β
5'- CACACTCACACTCACACACAC -3' reverse primer, were used as described
above with an annealing temperature at 62°C. Then, PCR products were cloned
into pCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) for the
generation of sense and anti-sense probes with the adapted promoters. Sense
and antisense <sup>35</sup>S-labeled probes of MIP-3α and MIP-3β, were obtained by run off
transcription of the 367 bp and 435 bp fragments, respectively. Six µm human
tonsil sections were fixed in acetone and 4% paraformaldehyde followed by 0.1
M triethanolamine/0.25% acetic anhydride. The sections were hybridized
overnight, RNAse A treated and exposed for 24 days. After development
sections were stained with hematoxylin.</li></sl></p><heading><u style="single">Example 1</u></heading><heading><i>Differential responsiveness to MIP-3α and MIP-3β
during development of CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived DC</i></heading><p num="0042">To understand the regulation of DC traffic the response to various
chemokines of DC at different stages of maturation was studied. DC were
generated from CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC cultured in the presence of GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> TNFα, and
tested at different days of culture for their ability to migrate in response to
chemokines in Boyden microchambers. MIP-3α and MIP-3β recruited 2 to 3
times more CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived DC than MIP-1α or RANTES. However, MIP-3α
and MIP-3β attracted DC collected at different time points of the culture. The
response to MIP-3α was already detected at day 4, maximal at day 5-6 and lasted
until day 10. At day 13 to 14, the response to MIP-3α was usually lost. In
contrast, the response to MIP-3β, which could not be detected before day 10,
peaked at day 13, and persisted beyond day 15. Of note, at early time points,
when most of the cells in culture were still DC precursors (CD1a<sup>-</sup>CD86<sup>-</sup>), the
response to MIP-3α could be detected at concentrations of 1 to 10 ng/ml
(depending on the experiment). In contrast, four days later, when almost all
cells were immature DC (CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>-</sup>), ≥300 ng/ml were needed to attract the
cells (Fig.2, day 10), suggesting a progressive desensitization of the cells during
maturation. Relatively high concentrations of MIP-3β (300 ng/ml) were also
needed to recruit mature DC (CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup>). Checkerboard analysis established
that MIP-3α and MIP-3β induced chemotaxis and not chemokinesis of DC.</p><p num="0043">To confirm the relation between the stage of maturation and the
response to MIP-3α and MIP-3β, CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived DC were sorted by FACS at day
10 of culture according to CD86 expression into immature DC (CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>-</sup>)
and mature DC (CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup>). CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>-</sup> responded exclusively to MIP-3a
while CD1a<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> responded mainly to MIP-3β. These observations also
confirmed that the cells recruited by MIP-3α and MIP-3β were indeed DC
(CD1a<sup>+</sup>). The correlation between DC maturation and chemokine
responsiveness was further illustrated when the immaturity of DC was
preserved by removing TNFα from day 6 to day 12 and when their maturation
was synchronized by addition of TNFα, LPS or CD40L. Response to MIP-3α had
strongly decreased upon 48h maturation with TNFα, LPS and CD40L.
Meanwhile, the response to MIP-3β was induced by all three signals, CD40L and 
LPS being more potent than TNFα. In kinetics experiments, the response to
MIP-3α decreased by 50 to 70% after only 24h of CD40 activation and was
completely lost at 72h. The response to MIP-3β was already maximal after 24h of
CD40 activation and required relatively high concentration of chemokine (100-300
ng/ml at 48h).</p><p num="0044">Taken together, these results establish that immature CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived DC
respond to MIP-3α while mature DC respond to MIP-3β.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 2</u></heading><heading><i>Responses to MIP-3α and MIP-3β parallel the expression
of their respective receptors CCR6 and CCR7 on CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived DC</i></heading><p num="0045">To define the mechanisms of regulation of MIP-3α and MIP-3β
responsiveness, the expression of their respective receptors CCR6 (Power, <i>et al.,</i>
1997,<i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>186</b>:825-835; Greaves, <i>et al.,</i> 1997, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. <b>186</b>:837-844; Baba,

Res. Commun</i>. <b>236</b>:212-217) and CCR7 (Yoshida, <i>et al.,</i> 199, <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i><b>272</b>:13803-13809) mRNA was studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. During DC
development from CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC, CCR6 mRNA was first detected at day 6,
increased up to day 10 after when it decreased and became barely detectable at
day 14. In contrast, CCR7 mRNA appeared at day 10 and steadily increased up to
day 14. Moreover, CD40L-dependent maturation induced progressive down-regulation
of CCR6 mRNA which became almost undetectable after 72h, and
up-regulation of CCR7 mRNA as early as 24h. Similar results were obtained
after either LPS or TNFα-induced DC maturation. The up-regulation of CCR7
mRNA following activation was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of cDNA
libraries.</p><p num="0046">In line with the migration assays, and the regulation of CCR6 and CCR7
expression, MIP-3 α induced a Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux exclusively in resting/immature DC
and MIP-3β in mature DC only. Maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes were observed with 30
ng/ml of MIP-3α and 30 ng/ml of MIP-3β, on immature and mature DC,
respectively. </p><p num="0047">These results show that changes in responsiveness to MIP-3α and MIP-3β
are linked to the regulation of CCR6 and CCR7 mRNA expression, and suggest
that CCR6 and CCR7 are the major functional receptors expressed on DC for
MIP-3α and MIP-3β, respectively.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 3</u></heading><heading><i>The response to MIP-3β is also induced
upon maturation of monocyte-derived DC</i></heading><p num="0048">Monocyte-derived DC, generated by culturing monocytes in presence of
GM-CSF+IL-4 for 6 days, are typically immature DC (CD1a<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>-</sup>, CD80<sup>low</sup>,
CD86<sup>low</sup>, CD83<sup>-</sup>) (Celia, <i>et al.,</i> 1997, <i>Current Opin. Immunol</i>. <b>9</b>:10-16; Sallusto, <i>et
al</i>., 1994, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>179</b>:1109-1118). They migrated in response to MIP-1α and
RANTES but neither to MIP-3α nor to MIP-3β. The lack of response of
monocyte-derived DC to MIP-3α is in accordance with the absence of CCR6
expression on those cells (Power, <i>et al.,</i> 1997, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>186</b>:825-835; Greaves, <i>et
al.</i>, 1997, <i>J. Exp. Med.</i><b>186</b>:837-844). Upon maturation induced by TNFα, LPS, or
CD40L, responses to MIP-1α and RANTES were lost while response to MIP-3β
was induced. Like with CD34<sup>+</sup>-derived DC, the response to MIP-3β correlated
with the up-regulation of CCR7 mRNA expression observed upon maturation
induced by TNFα, LPS or CD40L. Again, up-regulation of CCR7 occurred at
early time points (3 h), after TNFR or CD40 signaling. Moreover, migration and
chemokine receptor expression data were in agreement with Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux results.</p><p num="0049">These results extend to monocyte-derived DC the concept that upon
maturation, DC loose their responsiveness to various chemokines while they
become sensitive to a single chemokine, MIP-3β.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 4</u></heading><heading><i>Peripheral blood CE11c<sup>+</sup> DC migrate</i>
i<i>n response to MIP-3β after maturation</i></heading><p num="0050">The chemotactic activities of MIP-3α and MIP-3β on immature CD11c<sup>+</sup>
DC isolated from peripheral blood (or tonsils) also were studied. Freshly
isolated DC did not migrate in response to MIP-3α, nor to MIP-3β, an
observation which correlates with the absence of CCR6 and CCR7 mRNA
expression in these cells. However, the maturation which is known to occur 
after overnight culture with GM-CSF, turned on the response of CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC to
MIP-3β but not to MIP-3α. Once more, the response to MIP-3β correlated with
the induction of CCR7 mRNA expression.</p><p num="0051">Therefore, even though immature CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC freshly isolated from
blood cannot respond to MIP-3α, these results show that the maturation
dependent on responsiveness to MIP-3β also applies to <i>ex-vivo</i> isolated DC.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 5</u></heading><heading><i>In vivo MIP-3α is expressed in inflammed epithelium
and MIP-3β within T cell rich areas of tonsils</i></heading><p num="0052">The physiological relevance of the findings reported in Example 4 was
addressed through the analysis of MIP-3α and MIP-3β mRNA expressions by <i>in
situ</i> hybridization on sections of inflammed tonsils. mRNA for MIP-3α was
detected at high levels in inflammed epithelial crypts but not in T cell rich areas
nor in B cell follicles. In fact, MIP-3α expression was restricted to cells lining the
epithelial crypts. In contrast, expression of MIP-3β mRNA was restricted to T
cell rich areas. The strongest signal was present in scattered cells, with a
distribution overlapping that of IDC. Outside the paracortical area, no signal
could be detected in B cell follicles, nor in epithelial crypts. Serial sections
showed clear absence of MIP-3β expression within epithelial crypts where MIP-3α
was abundantly present. Sense probes for MIP-3α and MIP-3β, did not
generate background hybridization.</p><p num="0053">Therefore, MIP-3α expression is restricted to inflammed epithelium, at
the site of antigen entry where immature DC should be recruited. In contrast,
MIP-3β is only detected in paracortical areas, where mature IDC home and
generate primary T cell responses.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 6</u></heading><heading><i>Chemokine (MIP-3α) administrationin an in vitro mouse model</i></heading><p num="0054">Since MIP-3α was shown by the inventors to be a chemotactic factor for
mouse immature dendritic cells <i>in vitro</i>, the ability of the chemokine MIP-3α
to attract immature D<i>C in vivo</i> and to modulate the antigen-specific immune 
response against a tumor <i>in vivo</i> was studied. If a tumor-associated antigen is
delivered at the same time, more DC will be available to capture the antigen, an
therefore the antigen-specific response against this antigen should be increased.</p><p num="0055">Chemokine was delivered <i>in vivo</i> via a plasmid vector (PcDNA3,
InVitrogen), that contains the cDNA encoding mouse MIP-3α under the control
of the CMV promoter (PMIP-3α). The antigen used was β-galactosidase isolated
from <i>E. coli</i>. The antigen was delivered in viva via the same plasmid vector
PcDNA3 (called Placz). The tumor was a C26 colon carcinoma syngeneic in
BALB/c mice that has been stably transfected with the gene encoding for β-galactosidase.
Therefore, in this system, β-galactosidase defines a tumor-associated
antigen.</p><p num="0056">Groups of 6 female 6 week-old mice were injected with either the empty
PcDNA3 plasmid (negative control), the plasmid Placz encoding the antigen
alone, or a mixture of Placz and PMIP-3α. Injections (50 µg of total plasmid)
were performed in the hind footpad every week for 4 weeks. After that time,
mice were injected subcutaneously with the C26 tumor cell line expressing β-galactosidase.
Typically, all mice develop subcutaneous tumors after 10 days.
The appearance of tumors in these groups of mice were monitored. It was
found that the appearance of tumors was delayed after Placz and Placz+PMIP-α
injection (Figure 1). This shows that immunization with a plasmid encoding a
tumor-associated antigen has a protective effect against tumor engraftment.
The delay was greater with Placz+PMIP-3α than with Placz, suggesting that the
chemokine MIP-3α increases the tumor associated antigen-specific immune
response when delivered with the antigen.</p><p num="0057">It is believed that a good anti-tumor response is associated with a strong
T cell-mediated antigen-specific cytotoxicity (CTL activity). Therefore, the CTL 
activity in the same groups of mice was analyzed 30 days after tumor
inoculation. Spleen cells were removed and stimulated for five days with
irradiated syngeneic DC plus an immunodominant CTL peptide derived from
β-galadosidase in the presence of interleukin-2. Then their ability to lyse a cell
line stably transfected with the gene encoding for β-galactosidase (P13.1) was
measured, in parallel with their ability to lyse the parental cell line P815 that
does not express β-galactosidase (Figure 2). This was done using different ratios
of effectors (splenocytes) versus targets (P13.1 or P815). The results show that
mice injected with Placz+P-MIP-3α prior to tumor challenge have a greater CTL
activity than mice injected only with Placz or with PCDNA3 alone, against the
tumor-associated antigen β-galactosidase.</p><p num="0058">Many modifications and variations of this invention can be made
