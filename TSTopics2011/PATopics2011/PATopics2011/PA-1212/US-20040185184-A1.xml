ALD relies on self-limiting surface reactions in order to provide accurate thickness control, excellent conformality, and uniformity over large areas. As the microscopic features on a chip grow increasingly narrow and deep, these unique features make ALD one of the most promising deposition methods in the manufacturing of the future circuits. </p><p>[0004] The feature that makes ALD a unique deposition method compared to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is that it deposits atoms or molecules on a wafer a single layer at a time. Additionally, ALD films are deposited at temperatures significantly lower than comparable CVD processes, thereby contributing to lower thermal exposure of the wafer during processing. Furthermore, as another distinction from CVD methods, no strict precursor flux homogeneity is required in ALD because of the self-limiting growth mechanism. The flux has only to be large enough to fully saturate the surface with the given reactant. This enables, for example, the utilization of low vapor pressure solids, which are difficult to be delivered at constant rates. </p><p>[0005] ALD accomplishes deposition by introducing gaseous precursors alternately onto a workpiece such as, for example, semiconductor substrate or wafer. Under properly adjusted processing conditions, i.e., deposition temperature, reactant dose, length of precursor, and purge pulses, a chemisorbed monolayer of a first reactant is left on the surface of the workpiece after a purge sequence. Typically, the purge sequence is completed by evacuating or purging the entire reactor chamber. Afterwards, the first reactant is reacted subsequently with a second reactant pulse, such as a flux of a generated reactive gas species, to form a monolayer of a desired material along with any gaseous reaction byproducts, such as when compounds are used as precursors. The surface reactions are self-controlled and produce no detrimental gas phase reactions, thereby enabling accurate control of film thickness by counting the number of deposition cycles. </p><p>[0006] In one particular ALD method, there is a high degree of interest in using a point of use generated reactive gas species. However, for ALD processes, it is difficult to generate a high flux of short-lived reactive gas species on the surface of the wafers and cycle it through a number of on/off states at a fast rate required for high throughput ALD processes. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p>[0007] The present invention solves the above-mentioned difficulties by providing an improved atomic layer deposition method and system. In particular, a dispenser unit according to the present invention is used with a point of use generated reactive gas species for atomic layer deposition, which permits the cycling of the system through a number of on/off states at a fast rate for higher processing throughput. </p><p>[0008] In a reaction chamber containing a workpiece, a precursor gas is flown directly onto an exposed surface of the workpiece from the dispenser unit to form a surface reactant thereon. Additionally, an input gas is flown in through a side of the dispenser unit. The flows of precursor and input gases are separated by a pump/purge setup on the dispenser unit designed to prevent mixing. As the workpiece is scanned under the dispenser unit to form the surface reactant, the input gas is exposed to a focused beam of electromagnetic radiation. The electromagnetic radiation dissociates a gaseous constituent of the input gas creating the high flux of point of use generated reactive gas species. The incoming flux of the generated reactive gas species reacts with the surface reactant in a complete and self-limiting reaction forming a desired monolayer of a material thereon. Multiple dispenser units can be used to increase the ALD process. </p><p>[0009] A system and apparatus for generating a high flux of short-lived activated reactive gas species using transmission gas (es) is disclosed by commonly assigned patent application: Ser. No. 09/998073 for “A Method to Provide High Flux of Point of Use Activated Reactive Species for Semiconductor Processing,” filed on Nov. 30, 2001, which is herein incorporated fully by reference. </p><p>[0010] In one aspect, the present invention encompasses a method of chemically treating a surface of a workpiece. The method comprises exposing the surface of the workpiece to a direct flow of a precursor gas to form a surface reactant thereon, and providing a flow of an input gas above the surface of the workpiece. The method further comprises preventing the mixture of the precursor gas and the input gas with a purge gas, directing a beam of electromagnetic radiation into the input gas to produce a high flux of generated reactive gas species, and reacting the generated reactive gas species with the surface reactant. </p><p>[0011] In another aspect, the present invention encompasses a system for chemically treating a surface of a workpiece. The system comprises a supply of an input gas, a supply of a precursor gas, and a supply of a purge gas. A dispenser unit is adapted to expose the surface of the workpiece to a direct flow of the precursor gas for a surface reactant formation, to provide a flow of the input over the workpiece, and to provide the purge gas between the precursor gas and the input gas to prevent mixing of the precursor and input gases. The dispenser unit further includes a pair of evacuation ports for evacuating the purge gas. A source is adapted to converge a beam of electromagnetic radiation in the flow of the input gas in close proximity to the surface of the workpiece, but spaced a finite distance therefrom, to dissociate the input gas into a high flux of generated reactive gas species that reacts with the surface reactant to chemically treat the surface of the workpiece. </p><p>[0012] In still another aspect, the present invention encompasses a dispenser unit adapted for use in a reaction chamber for atomic layer deposition of a material onto a surface of a workpiece. The dispenser unit comprises a first gas port adapted to provide a flow on an input gas over the surface of the workpiece to be dissociated by a radiation beam into a point of use generated reactive species. Further included is a second gas port adapted to provide a direct flow of a precursor gas onto the surface of the workpiece which by chemisorption forms a first surface reactant, and a third gas port adapted to flow a purge gas to prevent mixing of the input and precursor gases. Also provided is a pair of evacuation ports adapted to evacuation at least the purge gas. </p><p>[0013] These and other features and objects of the present invention will be apparent in light of the description of the invention embodied herein. </p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading><p>[0014] The following detailed description of the embodiments of the present invention can be best understood when read in conjunction with the following drawings, where like structure is indicated with like reference numerals and in which: </p><p>[0015]FIG. 1 is an enlarged cross sectional view of a workpiece during a chemical treatment procedure according to the present invention; </p><p>[0016]FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic side view of a structure adapted to chemically treat a surface of a workpiece according to the present invention; </p><p>[0017]FIG. 3 is a diagrammatic top view of a structure adapted to chemically treat a surface of a workpiece according to the present invention; and </p><p>[0018]FIG. 4 is a process flow chart of a program which implements an embodiment of the atomic layer deposition method according to the present invention.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading><p>[0019] In the following detailed description that follows, reference is made to various specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that specific equipment, processing steps, energy sources, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </p><p>[0020] The term “workpiece” as used herein includes semiconductor substrate, printed circuits, and other structures that may be chemically treated by the method and system of the invention. </p><p>[0021] The terms “substrate” as used herein include any semiconductor-based or other structure having an exposed surface in which to form a structure using the system or method of this invention. Substrate is to be understood as including silicon-on-insulator, doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial layers of silicon supported by a base semiconductor foundation, and other semiconductor structures. Furthermore, when reference is made to a substrate in the following description, previous process steps may have been utilized to form active devices, regions or junctions in the base semiconductor structure or foundation. </p><p>[0022]FIG. 1 discloses an improved atomic layer deposition method and apparatus according to the present invention providing a point of use generated/activated reactive gas species for processing a surface <b>2</b> of a workpiece <b>4</b>. A first precursor gas, indicated by <b>5</b>, is flown directly onto the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece from a first gas port <b>6</b><i>a </i>of a dispenser unit <b>8</b>. From a side of the dispenser unit <b>8</b>, a flow of an input gas <b>10</b> is provided from a second gas port <b>6</b><i>b </i>in a direction away from the flow of the precursor gas <b>5</b>. </p><p>[0023] Between the first and second gas ports <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, the dispenser unit <b>8</b> further includes a pair of evacuation ports <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and a third gas port <b>6</b><i>c</i>. As illustrated, juxtaposed to the first evacuation port <b>12</b><i>a </i>are the first and third gas ports, <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>c</i>, and juxtaposed to the second evacuation port <b>12</b><i>b </i>are the second and third gas ports, <b>6</b><i>b </i>and <b>6</b><i>c</i>. The third gas port <b>6</b><i>c </i>is used to flow a purge gas, indicated by <b>14</b>, directly onto the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece. </p><p>[0024] In a purge/pump sequence, as the precursor gas <b>5</b>, input gas <b>10</b>, and purge gas <b>14</b> are flown from the dispenser unit <b>8</b>, the pair of evacuation ports <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>pump out any residuals/gases in their general vicinity. By this arrangement, ports <b>6</b><i>c </i>and <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>on the dispenser unit <b>8</b> prevent the mixing of the precursor gas <b>5</b> and the input gas <b>10</b> by creating a pump/purge barrier therebetween. </p><p>[0025] During processing, ALD pulse lengths are determined by the space between the gas ports as well as a scan speed of workpiece. Accordingly, under properly adjusted processing conditions (i.e., deposition temperature, reactant dose, and length of precursor and purge gases pulses), scanning the workpiece <b>4</b> under the dispenser unit <b>8</b> in the direction indicated by “X”, leaves a chemisorbed monolayer of a surface reactant, illustrated by symbols “A”, on the surface <b>2</b> after the purge/pump sequence of the dispenser unit <b>8</b> with flows of the precursor gas <b>5</b> and purge gas <b>14</b>. </p><p>[0026] While scanning the workpiece <b>4</b>, a beam of electromagnetic radiation <b>16</b> is directed into the input gas <b>10</b> producing at the point of use a high flux of short-lived generated reactive gas species, illustrated by symbols “B”, by dissociating a gaseous constituent of the input gas <b>10</b>. As the reactive gas species B reaches the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>, reactants A and B react together in a complete and self-limiting reaction which forms a desired monolayer of a material, illustrated by symbol S, on the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>. Material monolayer S may be an element or a compound. Therefore, the above-described multi-port dispenser unit <b>8</b> permits at the same time the formation of both surface reactant A on a first portion of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> and the desired material monolayer S on a subsequent surface portion of the workpiece. </p><p>[0027] The beam of electromagnetic radiation <b>16</b> may advantageously be provided as a converging laser beam. Additionally, to ensure that maximum energy is provided at the focal point of the laser beam, a transmission gas <b>18</b> that is substantially nonattenuating to preselected wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation may be provided by a fourth gas port <b>6</b><i>d</i>. Furthermore, the second gas port <b>6</b><i>b </i>may be a nozzle providing a laminar flow of the input gas <b>10</b> over the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> such that the beam <b>16</b> converges in the flow in close proximity to the surface of the workpiece, but spaced a finite distance therefrom. This finite distant is indicated by symbol “H.” It is to be appreciated that the input gas is provided over the surface of the workpiece in a gas layer having a thickness that is at least large enough to accommodate the finite distance H. </p><p>[0028] It is to be appreciated that a laminar flow prevents the input gas from spiraling over the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>, thereby minimizing non-uniform distribution of the generated reactive gas species B. Baffles may be incorporated into the nozzle <b>6</b><i>b </i>to break up the incoming gas stream into the desired laminar flow. Furthermore, the width of nozzle <b>6</b><i>b </i>can be made adjustable to optimize the gas flow rate for particular chemically treatments of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0029] With regard to distance H, the beam <b>16</b> is focused in proximity to the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> such that maximum beam energy dissociates at the point of use a gaseous constituent of the input gas <b>10</b> into the high flux of generated reactive gas species B. Preferably, distance H is less than a few mean-free-path lengths of the generated reactive gas species B, or from about 2 millimeters to about 4 millimeters above the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>. At a distance from about 2 millimeters to about 4 millimeters, the generated flux of reactive gas species B is closes enough in order to migrate to the surface <b>2</b>, yet far enough that the focal point of the laser beam <b>16</b> does not inadvertently impact the workpiece <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0030] It is to be further appreciated that the laser beam <b>16</b> can dissociate more than one generated reactive gas species B depending on the composition of the input gas <b>10</b>, and also depending on the particular wavelength(s) of electromagnetic radiation present in the laser beam <b>16</b>. Therefore, besides reducing energy losses of the laser at its focal point, the present invention also gives access to new, quickly disappearing metastables that would otherwise disappear and never reach the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece if formed well above the wafer surface. In the next sections, the above-described methodology and apparatus is further disclosed by the exemplary embodiments of a processing system <b>20</b> shown by FIGS. 2-4. </p><p>[0031]FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic sectional side view of the major component parts of an exemplary embodiment of a processing system <b>20</b> having a chamber <b>22</b> for containing the workpiece <b>4</b> to be processed. In a typical example, the workpiece <b>4</b> comprises a semiconductor wafe of 1 to 8 inches in diameter and 0.127 to 0.89 mm thick, which is supported upon a conventional chuck <b>24</b>. </p><p>[0032] The chamber <b>22</b> is sealable such that it may contain and hold a subambient pressure of from about 0.1 Torr to about 100 Torr of a gaseous atmosphere, generally indicated by <b>26</b>, which is supplied to the chamber from first and second gas sources <b>28</b><i>a </i>and <b>28</b><i>b</i>, respectively. As illustrated by FIG. 3, the first gas source <b>28</b><i>a </i>is in gas communication with the chamber <b>22</b>, and provides the precursor and purge gases <b>5</b> and <b>14</b>, and optionally, transmission gas <b>18</b>. These gases each may be a single gas or a mixture of such gasses. </p><p>[0033] The second gas source <b>28</b><i>b </i>is also in gas communication with the chamber <b>22</b> and provides the input gas <b>10</b>. Gases <b>5</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>14</b> and/or <b>18</b> are regulated in a conventional manner, such as for example, in-line pressure regulators <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>, values <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and mass flow meters <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>. When introducing mixtures of gases in the chamber <b>22</b>, including other conditioning gas/gases to aid and/or inhibit such chemical processes, conventional mixing chambers <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b </i>may be used, if desired, to homogenize the gaseous mixture(s). </p><p>[0034] After completion of the ALD processes, the gaseous atmosphere <b>26</b> within the chamber <b>22</b> may be quickly evacuated by a first mechanical exhaust pump <b>38</b><i>a </i>connected also in gas communication with the chamber via a first exhaust valve <b>40</b><i>a</i>. However, it is to be appreciated that unlike prior art type chambers, the entire gaseous atmosphere <b>26</b> within the chamber <b>22</b> does not need to be purge or exhausted between pulse phases of the ALD process due to the purge/pump set-up of the dispenser unit <b>8</b> provided therein. As illustrated by FIG. 3, the pair of evacuation ports <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the dispenser units are in gas communication with a second mechanical exhaust pump <b>38</b><i>b </i>and regulated by a second exhaust valve <b>40</b><i>b </i>for the above purpose. </p><p>[0035] The input gas <b>10</b> is a gas or mixture of gases that absorb predetermined wavelengths of electromagnetic energy and dissociate to form the desired generated reactive gas species B. Such gases that include: N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CCl<sub>4</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, CDF<sub>3</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, SiH<sub>4</sub>, CFCl<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>CO, (FCO)<sub>2</sub>, SF<sub>5</sub>NF<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>Br, CF<sub>3</sub>NO, (CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO, CF<sub>2 </sub>HCl, CF<sub>2</sub>HBr, CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>2</sub>CFCl, CF<sub>2</sub>CFH, CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, fluorohalides, halocarbons, and combinations thereof. Such desired reactive gas species B include: NO, OH, NH, N, F, CF<sub>3</sub>, CF<sub>2</sub>, CF, NF<sub>2</sub>, NF, Cl, O, BCl<sub>2</sub>, BCl, FCO, and combinations thereof. It is to be appreciated that the choice of input gas <b>10</b> employed in a photoreactive treatment procedure is guided by the type of chemically treatment process to be carried out. </p><p>[0036] The transmission gas <b>18</b>, if used, is a gas or mixture of gases that is non-attenuating to predetermined wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission gasses, as well as the purge gas include argon, nitrogen, helium, neon, and combinations thereof. </p><p>[0037] Depending on the particular parameters used in the chamber <b>22</b>, other conditioning gases may be used such as to absorb electromagnetic radiation, to reduce the concentration of an reactive gas species, or as a catalyst for the reaction between the reactive gas species B and the reactant(s), such as surface reactant A. As such, a conditioning gas may be employed for controlling the reaction rate between the reactive gas species B and reactant A, or for creating a minimum reaction energy threshold for limiting the production of undesirable reaction products (e.g., ozone and hazardous polymer-based reaction products). </p><p>[0038] Examples of conditioning gas molecules include nitrogen, helium and argon. Nitrogen acts mainly to impede the reaction between material deficient regions and reactant gases, while argon tends to impede the diffusion of the primary reactant gas molecules, rather than to participate in a reaction. Helium behaves in an intermediate manner between nitrogen and argon. </p><p>[0039] The chamber <b>22</b> also contains a translation stage <b>42</b> to support the workpiece <b>4</b> in the chuck <b>24</b> and to move it in and out of the chamber <b>22</b>. The translation stage <b>42</b> is electrically driven, and moves the chuck <b>24</b> and workpiece <b>4</b> held thereon back and forth within the chamber <b>22</b> at a constant rate (e.g., about 6.5 mm/sec) specified by a controller <b>44</b>. As best illustrated by FIG. 3, protruding banking pins <b>46</b> spaced by about 120 degrees hold the workpiece <b>4</b> in place on the chuck <b>24</b>. </p><p>[0040] In one embodiment, the translation stage <b>42</b> causes relative motion between the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>, the dispenser unit <b>8</b>, and the beam <b>16</b> such that the precursor gas <b>5</b>, purge gas <b>14</b>, and beam <b>16</b> sweeps or scans over the surface <b>2</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> during processing. In another embodiment, the workpiece <b>4</b> may be held stationary during processing, and the dispenser unit <b>8</b> and scanning optics <b>48</b> of a laser system <b>50</b> are moved to cause the desired relative motion between the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>, the dispenser unit <b>8</b>, and the beam <b>16</b>. </p><p>[0041] The laser beam <b>16</b> is shaped and delivered to the chamber <b>22</b> via the conventional laser system <b>50</b> that includes the scanning optics <b>48</b>, a laser controller <b>52</b>, and a laser source <b>54</b>. In particular, the scanning optics <b>48</b> typically comprises one or more mirrors <b>56</b> (only one of which is shown) and focusing lenses <b>58</b>. The mirrors <b>56</b> direct laser beam <b>16</b> towards the focusing lens <b>58</b> which shapes the conventional rectangular cross-section beam <b>16</b> received from the laser source <b>54</b> into a converging beam of electromagnetic energy proximate the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0042] In one embodiment, the focusing lens <b>58</b> forms part of a window <b>60</b> of the chamber <b>22</b>, such as in the embodiment when relative motion is provided between the laser beam <b>16</b> and workpiece <b>4</b> by the translation stage <b>42</b>. In other embodiments, the scanning optics <b>48</b> along with the focusing lens <b>58</b> move relative to the window <b>60</b> to provide the desired scanning of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> with beam <b>16</b>. The windows <b>60</b> may be quartz, sapphire, or zinc selenide. In still other embodiments, the focusing lens <b>58</b> is a cylindrical refractive lens, and both the lens <b>58</b> and window <b>60</b> are made from fused silica which allows visual inspection of the chamber <b>22</b> during a photoreactive treatment procedure, which is useful for monitoring the progress of a reaction as well as for end-point detection. </p><p>[0043] Additionally, although laser beam <b>16</b> is illustrated as a long narrow band <b>62</b> that extends across the major expanse of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> during processing, it is to be understood that laser beam <b>16</b> can comprise other shapes. For example, the beam <b>16</b> may be provided as a circular beam which traverses across an entirety of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> along the shown X and Y axes. Alternatively, the beam <b>16</b> can be configured to be wide enough to cover an entirety of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> without being passed across such surface. </p><p>[0044] Laser source <b>54</b> may be an excimer laser (for example, a Cymer CX-2 excimer laser available from Cymer Laser Technologies of San Diego, Calif., USA), which generates a pulsed beam <b>16</b> at wavelengths of 248 nm and 193 nm, and adapted to provide beam energy in the range of about 100 to about 5000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Other lasers could be used, e.g., a tunable Alexandrite solid state pulsed laser in combination with a frequency multiplier. As shown in FIG. 2, the cross-sectional dimensions of the beam <b>16</b> from the laser source <b>54</b> may be in the range of 3 mm×5 mm to 5 mm×15 mm. The scanning optics <b>48</b> focuses beam <b>16</b> so that at distance H above the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>, the final beam gives the appearance of a knife-edge. In particular, the laser beam <b>16</b> can predominantly comprise a single wavelength of ultraviolet light, and such wavelength can be chosen to interact with a specific constituent of the input gas <b>10</b>. </p><p>[0045] A beam dump <b>63</b> (FIG. 2) with a surface that strongly absorbs radiant energy in the range 157-250 nm (e.g., a block of hard-anodized aluminum with a row of narrow vanes oriented in the direction of the reflected laser beam) is mounted inside the chamber <b>22</b>. The beam dump <b>63</b> receives radiant energy reflected from the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> during processing. Additionally, a diagnostic laser beam <b>64</b> from a helium-neon laser <b>66</b> may be introduced into the chamber <b>22</b> through the scanning optics <b>48</b>, and/or through the window <b>60</b>. A monitor <b>68</b> could then be configured to receive a reflected diagnostic beam <b>64</b> to verify that the surface <b>2</b> has been treated without having to remove the workpiece <b>4</b> from the chamber <b>22</b> (e.g., by interferometric or light scattering techniques well-known in the field of surface analysis). </p><p>[0046] The translation stage <b>42</b> can comprise components for the temperature control of workpiece <b>4</b> during processing. Such components can include one or both of heating and cooling components <b>70</b> to maintain the workpiece <b>4</b> at a desired temperature. Additionally, the translation stage <b>42</b> may include various sensors that monitor pressure <b>72</b>, temperature <b>74</b>, and gases <b>76</b> in the chamber <b>22</b>. </p><p>[0047] For purposes of controlling the surface treatment sequence, the controller <b>44</b> produces the necessary signals to operate processing system <b>20</b> in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of the controller <b>44</b>. The controller <b>44</b> includes a programmable central processing unit (CPU) <b>202</b> that is operable with a memory <b>204</b>, a mass storage device <b>206</b>, an input control unit <b>208</b>, and a display unit <b>210</b>. However, those skilled in the art will realize that it would be a matter of routine skill to select an appropriate computer system to control processing system <b>20</b>. Additionally, those of skill in the art will also realize that the invention could be implemented using hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other hardware circuitry. As such, it should be understood that the invention could be implemented, in whole or in part, in software, hardware or both. </p><p>[0048] The controller <b>44</b> further includes well-known support circuits <b>214</b> such as power supplies <b>216</b>, clocks <b>218</b>, cache <b>220</b>, input/output (I/O) circuits <b>222</b> and the like. The I/O circuit is connected to a control system bus <b>212</b>. The bus <b>212</b> couples to the controller <b>44</b> the in-line flow regulators <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>, gas values <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, mass flow meters <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>, exhaust pumps <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b</i>, exhaust valves <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b</i>, translation stage <b>42</b>, laser controller <b>52</b>, heating and cooling components <b>70</b>, chamber sensors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>76</b>, and a chamber door <b>78</b>. Optionally, an electrically driven mechanical arm <b>80</b>, which moves the workpiece <b>4</b> in and out of the chamber <b>22</b> through the chamber door <b>78</b> to and from a transport device/chamber <b>82</b>, may be also controlled by the controller <b>44</b>. </p><p>[0049] Other elements controlled by the controller <b>44</b> may include the following: mixing chambers <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b </i>for mixing different gases, and if used, transition motors (not shown) for the dispenser unit <b>8</b> and scanning optics <b>48</b>. It is to be appreciated that the system controller <b>44</b> provides signals to the chamber elements to cause these elements to perform operations for forming the reactive gas species in the subject apparatus to accomplish atomic layer deposition, and other semi-conductor processing, if desired. </p><p>[0050] The memory <b>204</b> contains instructions that the CPU <b>202</b> executes to facilitate the performance of the processing system <b>20</b>. The instructions in the memory <b>204</b> are in the form of program code such as a program <b>300</b> (FIG. 4) that implements the method of the present invention. The program code may conform to any one of a number of different programming languages. For example, the program code can be written in C, C++, BASIC, Pascal, or a number of other languages. </p><p>[0051] The mass storage device <b>206</b> stores data and instructions and retrieves data and program code instructions from a processor-readable storage medium, such as a magnetic disk or magnetic tape. For example, the mass storage device <b>206</b> can be a hard disk drive, floppy disk drive, tape drive, or optical disk drive. The mass storage device <b>206</b> stores and retrieves the instructions in response to directions that it receives from the CPU <b>202</b>. Data and program code instructions that are stored and retrieved by the mass storage device <b>206</b> are employed by the processor unit <b>202</b> for operating the processing system <b>20</b>. The data and program code instructions are first retrieved by the mass storage device <b>206</b> from a medium and then transferred to the memory <b>204</b> for use by the CPU <b>202</b>. </p><p>[0052] The input control unit <b>208</b> couples a data input device, such as a keyboard, mouse, or light pen, to the processor unit <b>202</b> to provide for the receipt of a chamber operator's inputs. The display unit <b>210</b> provides information to a chamber operator in the form of graphical displays and alphanumeric characters under control of the CPU <b>202</b>. </p><p>[0053] The control system bus <b>212</b> provides for the transfer of data and control signals between all of the devices that are coupled to the control system bus <b>212</b>. Although the control system bus <b>212</b> is displayed as a single bus that directly connects the devices in the CPU <b>202</b>, the control system bus <b>212</b> can also be a collection of buses. For example, the display unit <b>210</b> input control unit <b>208</b> and mass storage device <b>206</b> can be coupled to an input-output peripheral bus, while the CPU <b>202</b> and memory <b>204</b> are coupled to a local processor bus. The local processor bus and input-output peripheral bus are coupled to form the control system bus <b>212</b>. Operation </p><p>[0054] Reference is also made to FIG. 4, which is a process flow chart of the program <b>300</b> that implements the ALD methodology according to the present invention. Prior to ALD processing, in step <b>310</b> an appropriate set of reaction parameters are selected for use by the controller <b>44</b>. Such reaction parameters include, for example but are not limited to: energy wavelength, energy density of the incident laser beam, gas composition, pressure and mass flow rates of precursor gas <b>5</b>, input gas <b>10</b>, purge gas <b>14</b>, and optionally, transmission gas <b>12</b> inside the reaction chamber <b>22</b>, stage translation rate, and temperature of workpiece <b>4</b>. </p><p>[0055] Once the reaction parameters are selected, the workpiece <b>4</b> in step <b>320</b> is loaded into the chamber <b>16</b> through door <b>78</b>, preferably from the transport device/chamber <b>82</b>, and positioned on the wafer chuck <b>24</b> against banking pins <b>46</b>, preferably by mechanical arm <b>80</b>, with the surface <b>2</b> to be treated facing up. The order of selecting reaction parameters in step <b>310</b> and loading in step <b>320</b> is non-critical, and may be completed in any order or simultaneously. </p><p>[0056] In step <b>330</b>, mechanical pump <b>38</b> <i>a </i>pumps on the chamber <b>22</b> until a pressure of between about 1 and about 10 Torr is achieved. Next, in step <b>340</b> the stage <b>42</b> translates the chuck <b>24</b> and workpiece <b>4</b> at a constant rate across the chamber <b>22</b> from a rear end <b>84</b> to a forward end <b>86</b> (FIG. 2). When portion of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece is at its proper position for processing, in step <b>350</b> the controller <b>44</b> electrically activates gas values <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>and flow regulators <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>(in proper sequence). The controller <b>44</b> coordinates the delivery of precursor gas <b>5</b>, input gas <b>10</b>, and optionally transmission gas <b>12</b> (FIG. 1) from gas cylinders <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and <b>28</b> <i>b </i>through the dispenser unit <b>8</b> according to the selected reaction parameters. Additionally, in this step, the controller <b>44</b> coordinates the delivery of purge gas <b>14</b>, and the pumping on evacuation ports <b>12</b> <i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>by pump <b>38</b><i>b </i>to prevent mixing of the precursor gas <b>5</b> and input gas <b>10</b> flows. </p><p>[0057] In step <b>360</b>, the controller <b>44</b> coordinates with the laser controller <b>52</b> to deliver the laser beam <b>16</b> into the input gas flow <b>10</b>. It is to be appreciated that controller <b>44</b> may be programmed to process the entire surface of the workpiece or a targeted portion. In either case, the controller <b>44</b> provides for the delivery of the laser beam <b>16</b> according to the selected reaction parameters such that the high flux of point of use reactive gas species B is generated at the proper time to react with surface reactant A at the selected locations of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>. In most cases, the controller <b>44</b> will delay the generation of the high flux of point of use reactive gas species B until reactant A is translated into its proper position for such interaction with gas species B. </p><p>[0058] In step <b>370</b>, the controller <b>44</b> checks the formation of material monolayer S on the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b>. Such as, for example, if a desired layer thickness or quality is not detected by monitor <b>68</b>, the above deposition processes may be repeated without removing the workpiece <b>4</b> from the reaction chamber <b>22</b>. If the above ALD process is completed, the gas valves <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>are closed, the chamber <b>22</b> is purged in a conventional manner, and the workpiece <b>4</b> is then removed from the chamber <b>22</b> in step <b>380</b> to await a next workpiece <b>4</b> for processing in step <b>390</b>. </p><p>[0059] In addition to the above-described ALD process, in certain situations it is may be desirous to chemically work the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> with only the generated reactive gas species B before or after such ALD processing. Examples of such chemical treatments include, but not limited to, etching, cleaning, removing photoresist, and other applications which will be apparent to those of skill in the art given the teachings herein. Depending on the kind of processing the workpiece <b>4</b> is subjected to prior to being treated in chamber <b>22</b>, and/or the type of post-processing the workpiece <b>4</b> is to undergo, the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> may be treated as many times as required without being removed from the chamber <b>16</b>, and if desired, under different reaction conditions. </p><p>[0060] It is to be appreciated that the above described method and apparatus of the present invention increases ALD production rates. The increase in production rates results from permitting the working of the surface <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>4</b> with the high flux of a point of use generated reactive gas species while ahead of forming a surface reactant with a flow of a precursor gas without the need to completely purge or evacuate the entire reaction chamber. </p><p>[0061] Additionally, the present invention makes it possible to use two or more dispenser units to further increase the ALD process. In a multiple dispenser unit arrangement, for each additional radiation beam another dispenser unit is provided, such as is illustrated by secondary dispenser unit <b>8</b>′ and additionally radiation beam <b>16</b>′ in FIG. 2. Since the function of the secondary dispenser unit <b>8</b>′ and beam <b>16</b>′ are the same as dispenser unit <b>8</b> and beam <b>16</b> as described above, for brevity, no further discussion is provided as one skilled in the art would understand the use and benefit of such an arrangement. </p><p>[0062] In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents.
