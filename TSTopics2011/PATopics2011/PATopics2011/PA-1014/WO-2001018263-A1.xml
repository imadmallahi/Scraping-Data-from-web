In the case of using air for the supply of oxygen, the effect of limited oxygen solubility is such that the rate of reaction becomes dependent on, and is limited by, the rate of oxygen transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. Specific examples of this are cited in the literature for bioleaching applications <sup>,2</sup>'.</p><p num="p0007">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0008">According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating a slurry containing reactants to be oxidised which includes the step of supplying a feed gas containing in excess of 21% oxygen by volume, to the slurry.</p><p num="p0009">The slurry may be an aqueous slurry containing significant quantities of solid reactants.

As used herein the expression "oxygen enriched gas" is intended to include a gas, eg air which contains in excess of 21 % oxygen by volume This is an oxygen content greater than the oxygen content of air The expression "pure oxygen<sup>"</sup> is intended to include a gas which contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume</p><p num="p0010"><sup>"</sup>Reactant", as used herein, includes a substance or material which requires the presence of oxygen to undergo a chemical reaction</p><p num="p0011">Preferably the feed gas which is supplied to the slurry contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume le is substantially pure oxygen</p><p num="p0012">The method may include the step of maintaining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a desired range which may be determined by the operating conditions and the type of reactants in the slurry In oxidation processes limited by oxygen mass transfer, the applicant has established that a lower limit for the dissolved oxygen concentration to sustain oxidation, is in the range of from 0.2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 4.0 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> On the other hand if the dissolved oxygen concentration is too high the oxygen utilisation efficiency is reduced and the rate of reaction may be inhibited The upper threshold concentration also depends on the nature of the process and on the reactants but typically is in the range of from 4 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0013">Thus, preferably, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry is maintained in the range of from 0 2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0014">The method may include the steps of determining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry and, in response thereto, of controlling at least one of the following the oxygen content of the feed gas, the rate of supply of the feed gas to the slurry, and the rate of feed of slurry to a reactor</p><p num="p0015">The dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry may be determined in any appropriate way, e g by one or more of the following by direct measurement of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, by measurement of the oxygen content in gas above the slurry, and indirectly by measurement of the oxygen

According to a different aspect of the invention there is provided a method of oxygenating a slurry containing process reactants which includes the steps of maintaining the slurry at a temperature in excess of 40°C and controlling the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a predetermined range</p><p num="p0021">The said dissolved oxygen concentration may be controlled by controlling the supply of oxygen to the slurry The oxygen may be supplied to the slurry in the form of oxygen enriched gas or substantially pure oxygen</p><p num="p0022">The said temperature is preferably in the range of 60°C to 85°C</p><p num="p0023">The invention specifically extends to a method of enhancing the oxygen mass transfer coefficient from a gas phase to a liquid phase of a solid/liquid slurry which includes the step of supplying a feed gas containing in excess of 21 % oxygen by volume to the slurry</p><p num="p0024">The feed gas preferably contains in excess of 85% oxygen by volume</p><p num="p0025">The invention further extends to a method of oxygenating an aqueous slurry containing solid reactants which includes the steps of oxygenating the slurry at a temperature above 40°C and maintaining the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry in the range of from 0 2 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0026">The dissolved oxygen concentration may be maintained by supplying gas containing in excess of 21% oxygen by volume to the slurry</p><p num="p0027">The invention is also intended to cover a process plant which includes a reactor vessel, a source which feeds a solid/liquid slurry to the vessel, an oxygen source, a device which measures the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry in the vessel, and a control mechanism whereby, in response to the said measure of dissolved oxygen concentration, the supply of oxygen from the oxygen source to the slurry is controlled to achieve a dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a predetermined range

Various techniques may be used for controlling the supply of oxygen to the slurry and hence for controlling the dissolved oxygen content or concentration in the slurry at a desired value Use may for example be made of valves which are operated manually For more accurate control use may be made of an automatic control system These techniques are known in the art and are not further described herein</p><p num="p0028">For example use may be made of a dissolved oxygen probe to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry directly To achieve this the probe is immersed in the slurry The dissolved oxygen concentration may be measured indirectly by using a probe in the reactor off-gas or by transmitting a sample of the off-gas, at regular intervals, to an oxygen gas analyser Again it is pointed out that measuring techniques of this type are known in the art and accordingly any appropriate technique can be used</p><p num="p0029">A preferred approach to the control aspect is to utilise one or more probes to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, whether directly or indirectly The probes produce one or more control signals which are used to control the operation of a suitable valve or valves, eg solenoid valves, automatically so that the supply of oxygen to an air stream which is being fed to the slurry is varied automatically in accordance with real time measurements of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry A similar approach may be used to control the carbon dioxide content in the slurry</p><p num="p0030">Although it is preferred to control the addition of oxygen to a gas stream which is fed to the slurry a reverse approach may be adopted in that the oxygen supply rate to the reactor vessel may be maintained substantially constant and the rate of supply of the solid reactants in the slurry to the reactor vessel may be varied to achieve a desired dissolved oxygen concentration</p><p num="p0031">The invention is not limited to the actual control technique employed and is intended to extend to variations of the aforegoing approaches and to any equivalent process</p><p num="p0032">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p><p num="p0033">The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which

 Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a portion of a plant in which the invention is carried out, and Figures 2, 3 and 4 reflect various results and parameters obtained from operating a reactor using the principles of the invention</p><p num="p0034">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</p><p num="p0035">General Principles</p><p num="p0036">The limitation of low oxygen solubility during a process involving oxidation in a slurry, using air, at high temperatures which in turn limits the rate of reaction requires enrichment of the air with oxygen le air with an oxygen content greater than 21% by volume, or the use of pure oxygen (defined as being greater than 85% oxygen by volume) The use of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen overcomes the limited rate of reaction due to oxygen supply constraints, but has two major disadvantages a) the provision of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen is expensive and requires a high utilisation (&gt;60%) of the oxygen to warrant the additional expense <sup>(3)</sup>, and b) if the oxygen level in solution becomes too high the reaction rate may be reduced and oxygen utilisation decreases</p><p num="p0037">Therefore in order to realise the benefits of high rates of reaction at high temperatures in commercial plants, the drawbacks of requiring expensive oxygen and the risk of failure if the dissolved oxygen levels become too high must be overcome</p><p num="p0038">The oxidation of solid reactants at an elevated temperature results in high rates of reaction, but is dependent on the supply of oxygen and possibly carbon dioxide in certain applications, to maintain high rates of reaction The absorption of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bioleaching reactor is limited, in each case, by the rate of mass transfer from the gas phase into the solution phase For oxygen the rate of oxygen absorption is defined by equation (1) as follows</p><p num="p0039">R = M (C<sup>*</sup> - C<sub>L</sub>) (1) where R = Oxygen demand as mass (kg) per unit volume (m<sup>3</sup>) per unit tιme(s) (kg/m<sup>3</sup>/s), 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 M = Oxygen mass transfer coefficient in reciprocal seconds (s<sup>'1</sup>),</p><p num="p0040">C<sup>*</sup> = Saturated dissolved oxygen concentration as mass (kg) per unit volume (m<sup>3</sup>) (kg/m<sup>3</sup>), and C<sub>L</sub> = Dissolved oxygen concentration in solution as mass (kg) per unit volume (m<sup>3</sup>) (kg/m<sup>3</sup>)</p><p num="p0041">The factor (C<sup>*</sup> - C<sub>L</sub>) is referred to as the oxygen driving force A similar equation may be used to describe the rate of carbon dioxide supply to the solution If the sulphide mineral oxidation rate is increased the oxygen demand increases proportionately To meet a higher oxygen demand either the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (M) or the oxygen driving force (C<sup>*</sup>-C<sub>L</sub>) must be increased</p><p num="p0042">An increase in the oxygen mass transfer coefficient may be achieved by increasing the power input to a mixer in the reactor This improves gas dispersion in the sulphide mineral slurry With this approach, however, an increase in the oxygen mass transfer coefficient of, for example, 40% requires an increase in the power input to the mixer by a factor of as much as 200%, with a commensurate increase in operating costs</p><p num="p0043">The oxygen driving force may be increased by increasing the saturated dissolved oxygen concentration C<sup>*</sup> and reducing the dissolved oxygen content or concentration C<sub>L</sub></p><p num="p0044">The applicant has established that a lower limit for the dissolved oxygen concentration to sustain most oxidation reactions is in the range of from 0 2 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 4 0 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> Thus, in order to provide an adequate, or optimum, supply of oxygen, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the sulphide mineral slurry must be monitored and, where appropriate, the addition of oxygen to the sulphide mineral slurry must be controlled in order to maintain the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration in solution at a value of from 0 2 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 4 0 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></p><p num="p0045">On the other hand the dissolved oxygen concentration must not exceed an upper threshold value at which the reaction rate is adversely affected It is pointed out that the upper threshold concentration depends on 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
the nature of the process and the reactants A typical upper threshold value is in the range of from 4 x 10<sup>'3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 10 x 10<sup>"3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>, as for example in the application of bioleaching <sup>(4)</sup></p><p num="p0046">As has been previously indicated the rate of reaction which can be achieved when operating at a relatively low temperature of the order of from 40°C to 55°C, is limited In order to increase the rate of oxidation it is desirable in many instances to make use temperatures in excess of 60°C The optimum operating temperature is dependent on the nature of the process</p><p num="p0047">The applicant has established that the operation of the process, using a gas enriched with oxygen, or pure oxygen, as the oxidant at elevated temperatures of from 40°C to 85°C increases the specific oxidation duty of the reactor considerably, results in an unexpected and significantly enhanced oxygen mass transfer rate, increases the oxygen utilisation, providing that the dissolved oxygen concentration is controlled above the point where oxidation is prevented and below the point at which oxidation is inhibited, and the overall power required for oxidation is significantly reduced</p><p num="p0048">The controlled addition of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen directly into the bioreactor improves the oxygen utilisation efficiency In one example for bioleaching of mineral sulphides, the oxygen utilisation for a conventional commercial bioleach plant (at least 100m<sup>3</sup> in volume) operating at from 40°C to 45°C with air may be expected to achieve a maximum oxygen utilisation factor of from 40% to 50% Consequently only 40% to 50% of the total mass of oxygen supplied to the bioleach plant is used to oxidise the sulphide minerals With the method of the invention the oxygen utilisation is significantly higher, of the order of from 60% to 95% The higher oxygen utilisation is achieved by controlled oxygen addition and results from the enhanced oxygen mass transfer rate and by operating at low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the solution phase</p><p num="p0049">It will be appreciated that although high oxygen demand in process reactors has come about primarily by the use of higher temperatures, rapid oxidation rates at temperatures below 60°C will have similarly high oxygen

demands The method of the invention is therefore not restricted to suit high temperature processes only, i e at temperatures above 60°C, but also low temperature processes from 30°C to 60°C</p><p num="p0050">Another advantage of using air enriched with oxygen or pure oxygen is that the evaporation losses are reduced, because there is less inert gas removing water vapour from the top of the reactor This is particularly important in areas where water is scarce or expensive</p><p num="p0051">In carrying out the method of the invention the temperature of the slurry in the reactor may be controlled in any suitable way known in the art In one example the reactor is insulated and heating takes place by means of energy which is released by the oxidation process The temperature of the slurry is regulated using any suitable cooling system, for example an internal cooling system</p><p num="p0052">In the specific application for bioleaching, Table 1 shows typical data for specific sulphide oxidation duty and oxygen utilisation, when bioleaching with air at 40°C to 45°C, in two commercial bioreactors, Plant A and Plant B respectively, (greater than 100m<sup>3</sup> in volume)</p><p num="p0053">Table 1 Commercial Bioreactor Performance Results</p><p num="p0054"><img id="imgf000011_0001" orientation="portrait" wi="149" img-format="tif" img-content="table" file="imgf000011_0001.tif" inline="no" he="77"/><!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
