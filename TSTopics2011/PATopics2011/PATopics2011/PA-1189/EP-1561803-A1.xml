treatment of fabrics. More specifically, the present invention relates to a laundry
detergent composition capable of both cleaning and softening fabric during a
laundering process.</p><heading><b>Background</b></heading><p num="0002">Laundry detergent compositions that both clean and soften fabric during a
laundering process are known and have been developed and sold by laundry
detergent manufacturers for many years. Typically, these laundry detergent
compositions comprise components that are capable of providing a fabric-softening
benefit to the laundered fabric; these fabric-softening components include clays.</p><p num="0003">The incorporation of clay into laundry detergent compositions to impart a
fabric-softening benefit to the laundered fabric is described in the following
references. A granular, built laundry detergent composition comprising a smectite
clay that is capable of both cleaning and softening a fabric during a laundering
process is described in US 4,062,647 (Storm, T. D., and Nirschl, J. P.; The Procter &amp;
Gamble Company). A heavy-duty fabric-softening detergent comprising bentonite
clay agglomerates is described in GB 2 138 037 (Allen, E., Coutureau, M., and
Dillarstone, A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company). Laundry detergents compositions
containing fabric-softening clays of between 150 and 2,000 micrometers in size are
described in US 4,885,101 (Tai, H. T.; Lever Brothers Company). The fabric-softening
performance of a clay-containing laundry detergent composition is
improved by the incorporation of a flocculating aid to the clay-containing laundry
detergent composition. For example, a detergent composition comprising a smectite
type clay and a polymeric clay-flocculating agent is described in EP 0 299 575
(Raemdonck, H., and Busch, A.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company). </p><p num="0004">The use of silicones to provide a fabric-softening benefit to laundered fabric
during a laundering process is also known. US 4,585,563 (Busch, A., and Kosmas,
S.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company) describes that specific organo-functional
polydialkylsiloxanes can advantageously be incorporated in granular detergents to
provide remarkable benefits inclusive of through-the-wash softening and further
textile handling improvements. US 5,277,968 (Canivenc, E.; Rhone-Poulenc
Chemie) describes a process for the conditioning of textile substrates to allegedly
impart a pleasant feel and good hydrophobicity thereto, comprising treating such
textile substances with an effective conditioning amount of a specific
polydiorganosiloxane.</p><p num="0005">Detergent Manufacturers have attempted to incorporate both clay and silicone
in the same laundry detergent composition. For example, siliconates were
incorporated in clay-containing compositions to allegedly improve their dispensing
performance. US 4, 419, 250 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive
Company) describes agglomerated bentonite particles that comprise a salt
of a lower alkyl siliconic acid and/or a polymerization product(s) thereof. US 4, 421,
657 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company)
describes a particulate heavy-duty laundering and textile-softening composition
comprising bentonite clay and a siliconate. US 4, 482,477 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R.,
and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company) describes a particulate built synthetic
organic detergent composition which includes a dispensing assisting proportion of a
siliconate and preferably bentonite as a fabric-softening agent. In another example,
EP 0 163 352 (York, D. W.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company) describes the
incorporation of silicone into a clay-containing laundry detergent composition in an
attempt to control the excessive suds that are generated by the clay-containing
laundry detergent composition during the laundering process. EP 0 381 487 (Biggin,
I. S., and Cartwright, P. S.; BP Chemicals Limited) describes an aqueous based liquid
detergent formulation comprising clay that is pretreated with a barrier material such
as a polysiloxane.</p><p num="0006">Detergent manufacturers have also attempted to incorporate a silicone, clay
and a flocculant in a laundry detergent composition. For example, a fabric treatment 
composition comprising substituted polysiloxanes, fabric-softening clay and a clay
flocculant is described in WO92/07927 (Marteleur, C. A. A. V. J., and Convents, A.
C.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company).</p><p num="0007">More recently, fabric care compositions comprising an organophilic clay and
functionalised oil are described in US 6,656, 901 B2 (Moorfield, D., and Whilton,
N.; Unilever Home &amp; Personal Care USA division of Conopco, Inc.). WO02/092748
(Instone, T. et al; Unilever PLC) describes a granular composition comprising an
intimate blend of a non-ionic surfactant and a water-insoluble liquid, which may be a
silicone, and a granular carrier material, which may be a clay. WO03/055966
(Cocardo, D. M., et al; Hindustain Lever Limited) describes a fabric care
composition comprising a solid carrier, which may be a clay, and an anti-wrinkle
agent, which may be a silicone.</p><p num="0008">However, despite all of the above attempts, whatever improved fabric-softening
performance benefit that detergent manufacturers have been able to achieve for a
laundry detergent has come at the expense of its fabric-cleaning performance.
Therefore, there is still a need to improve the fabric-softening performance of a
laundry detergent composition without unduly negatively affecting its fabric-cleaning
performance.</p><heading><b>Summary</b></heading><p num="0009">The present invention overcomes the above mentioned problem by providing
an auxiliary composition, for use in the laundering or treatment of fabrics,
comprising a co-particulate admix, the co-particulate admix comprises: (i) clay; and
(ii) a hydrophobic component; and (iii) a charged polymeric fabric-softening boosting
component; wherein the auxiliary composition further comprises a flocculating aid
and optionally one or more adjunct components. </p><heading><b>Detailed Description</b></heading><heading><u style="single">Clay</u></heading><p num="0010">Typically, the clay is a fabric-softening clay such as a smectite clay. Preferred

above. Preferred clays are supplied under the tradenames: Fulasoft 1 by Arcillas
Activadas Andinas; White Bentonite STP by Fordamin; and Detercal P7 by Laviosa
Chemica Mineraria SPA.</p><p num="0012">The clay may be a hectorite clay. Typical hectorite clay has the general
formula:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/"><i>Formula (III)</i>   [(Mg<sub>3-x</sub>Li<sub>x</sub>)Si<sub>4-y</sub>Me<sup>III</sup><sub>y</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH<sub>2-z</sub>F<sub>z</sub>)]<sup>-(x+y)</sup>((x+y)/n)M<sup>n+</sup></st32:che> 
   wherein y = 0 to 0.4, if y = &gt;0 then Me<sup>III</sup> is Al, Fe or B, preferably y = 0; M<sup>n+</sup> is
a monovalent (n = 1) or a divalent (n = 2) metal ion, preferably selected from Na, K,
Mg, Ca and Sr. x is a number from 0.1 to 0.5, preferably from 0.2 to 0.4, more
preferably from 0.25 to 0.35. z is a number from 0 to 2. The value of (x + y) is the
layer charge of the clay, preferably the value of (x + y) is in the range of from 0.1 to
0.5, preferably from 0.2 to 0.4, more preferably from 0.25 to 0.35. A preferred
hectorite clay is that supplied by Rheox under the tradename Bentone HC. Other
preferred hectorite clays for use herein are those hectorite clays supplied by CSM
Materials under the tradename Hectorite U and Hectorite R, respectively.</p><p num="0013">The clay may also be selected from the group consisting of: allophane clays;
chlorite clays, preferred chlorite clays are amesite clays, baileychlore clays,

clays, dickite clays, nacrite clays and hisingerite clays; smectite clays; vermiculite
clays; and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0014">The clay may also be a light coloured crystalline clay mineral, preferably
having a reflectance of at least 60, more preferably at least 70, or at least 80 at a
wavelength of 460nm. Preferred light coloured crystalline clay minerals are china
clays, halloysite clays, dioctahedral clays such as kaolinite, trioctahedral clays such as

(montmorillonite), beidilite, nontronite, hectorite, attapulgite, pimelite, mica,
muscovite and vermiculite clays, as well as pyrophyllite/talc, willemseite and
minnesotaite clays. Preferred light coloured crystalline clay minerals are described in
GB2357523A and WO01/44425.</p><p num="0015">Preferred clays have a cationic exchange capacity of at least 70meq/100g. The
cationic exchange capacity of clays can be measured using the method described in 
Grimshaw, The Chemistry and Physics of Clays, Interscience Publishers, Inc., pp.
264-265 (1971).</p><p num="0016">Preferably, the clay has a weight average primary particle size, typically of
greater than 20 micrometers, preferably more than 23 micrometers, preferably more
than 25 micrometers, or preferably from 21 micrometers to 60 micrometers, more
preferably from 22 micrometers to 50 micrometers, more preferably from 23
micrometers to 40 micrometers, more preferably from 24 micrometers to 30
micrometers, more preferably from 25 micrometers to 28 micrometers. Clays having
these preferred weight average primary particle sizes provide a further improved
fabric-softening benefit. The method for determining the weight average particle size
of the clay is described in more detail hereinafter.</p><heading><i>Method For Determining The Weight Average Primary Particle Size Of The Clay:</i></heading><p num="0017">The weight average primary particle size of the clay is typically determined
using the following method: 12g clay is placed in a glass beaker containing 250ml
distilled water and vigorously stirred for 5 minutes to form a clay solution. The clay
is not sonicated, or microfluidised in a high pressure microfluidizer processor, but is
added to said beaker of water in an unprocessed form (i.e. in its raw form). 1ml clay
solution is added to the reservoir volume of an Accusizer 780 single-particle optical
sizer (SPOS) using a micropipette. The clay solution that is added to the reservoir
volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS is diluted in more distilled water to form a
diluted clay solution; this dilution occurs in the reservoir volume of said Accusizer
780 SPOS and is an automated process that is controlled by said Accusizer 780
SPOS, which determines the optimum concentration of said diluted clay solution for
determining the weight average particle size of the clay particles in the diluted clay
solution. The diluted clay solution is left in the reservoir volume of said Accusizer
780 SPOS for 3 minutes. The clay solution is vigorously stirred for the whole period
of time that it is in the reservoir volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS. The diluted
clay solution is then sucked through the sensors of said Accusizer 780 SPOS; this is
an automated process that is controlled by said Accusizer 780 SPOS, which
determines the optimum flow rate of the diluted clay solution through the sensors for 
determining the weight average particle size of the clay particles in the diluted clay
solution. All of the steps of this method are carried out at a temperature of 20°C. This
method is carried out in triplicate and the mean of these results determined.</p><heading><u style="single">Hydrophobic component</u></heading><p num="0018">Typically, the hydrophobic component is a silicone, more preferably a fabric-softening
