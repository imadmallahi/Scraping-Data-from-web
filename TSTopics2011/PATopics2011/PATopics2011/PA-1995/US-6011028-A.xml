The activity of nitric oxide (NO) as a vasodilator has been known for well over 100 years and NO is the active component of amylnitrite, glyceryltrinitrite and other nitrovasoadaaors. The recent identification of EDRF as NO has coincided with the discovery of a biochemical pathway by which NO is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by the enzyme NO synthase.</p><p>NO is the endogenous stimulator of the soluble guanylate cyclase and is involved in a number of biological actions in addition to endothelium-dependent relaxation including cytotoxicity of phagocytic cells and cell-to-cell communication in the central nervous system (see Moncada et al. Biochemical Pharmacology. 38, 1709-1715 (1989) and Moncada et al. Pharmacological Reviews. 43, 109-142 (1991). It is now thought that excess NO production may be involved in a number of conditions, particularly conditions which involve systemic hypotension such as toxic shock and therapy with certain cytokines.</p><p>The synthesis of NO from L-arginine can be inhibited by the L-arginine analogue, L-N-monomethyl-arginine (L-NMMA) and the therapeutic use of L-NMMA for the treatment of toxic shock and other types of systemic hypotension has been proposed (WO 91/04024 and GB-A-2240041). The therapeutic use of certain other NO synthase inhibitors apart from L-NMMA for the same purpose has also been proposed in WO 91/04024 and EP-A-0446099.</p><p>It has recently become apparent that there are at least three types of NO synthase as follows:</p><p>(i) a constitutive, Ca.sup.++ /calmodulin dependent enzyme, located in the endothelium, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.</p><p>(ii) a constitutive, Ca.sup.++ /calmodulin dependent enzyme, located in the brain, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.</p><p>(iii) a Ca.sup.++  independent enzyme which is induced after activation of vascular smooth muscle, macrophages, endothelial cells, and a number of other cells by endotoxin and cytokines. Once expressed this inducible NO synthase synthesizes NO for long periods.</p><p>The NO released by the constitutive enzymes acts as a transduction mechanism underlying several physiological responses. The NO produced by the inducible enzyme is a cytotoxic molecule for tumor cells and invading microorganisms. It also appears that the adverse effects of excess NO production, in particular pathological vasodilation and tissue damage, may result largely form the effect of NO synthesized by the inducible NO synthase.</p><p>There is also a growing body of evidence that NO may be involved in the degeneration of cartilage which takes place in certain conditions such as arthritis and it is also known that NO synthesis is increased in rheumatoid arthritis. Accordingly, further conditions in which there is an advantage in inhibiting NO production from L-arginine include autoimmune and/or inflammatory conditions affecting the joints, for example arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular ischemia, diabetes, hyperalgesia (allodynia), cerebral ischemia (both focal ischemia, thrombotic stroke and global ischemia, secondary to cardiac arrest), and other CNS disorders mediated by NO.</p><p>Further conditions in which there is an advantage in inhibiting NO production from L-arginine include systemic hypotension associated with septic and/or toxic shock induced by a wide variety of agents; therapy with cytokines such as TNF, IL-1 and IL-2; and as an adjuvant to short term immunosuppression in transciant therapy. Further conditions in which there is an advantage in inhibiting NO production from L-arginine include autoimmune diseases and/or inflammatory conditions such as those affecting the joints, for example arthritis or ARDS or inflammatory bowel disease, or asthma, cardiovascular ischemia, congestive heart failure, mycoarditits, artherosclerosis, migraine, reflux esophagitis, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis, emphysema, diabetes, hyperalgesia (allodynia) cerebral ischmeia (both focal ischemia, thrombotic stroke and global ischemia, secondary to cardiac arrest) and other CNS disorders mediated by NO, including opiate tolerance in patients needing protracted opiate analgesics, benzodiazepine tolerance in patients taking benzodiazepines, an other addictive behaviors for example nicotine and eating disorder.</p><p>Some of the NO synthase inhibitors proposed for therapeutic use so far, and in particular L-NMMA, are non-selective in that they inhibit both the constitutive and the inducible NO synthase. Use of such a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor requires that great care be taken in order to avoid the potentially serious consequences of over-inhibition of the constitutive NO-synthase including hypertension and possible thrombosis and tissue damage. In particular, in the case of the therapeutic use of L-NMMA for the treatment of toxic shock it has been recommended that the patient must be subject to continuous blood pressure monitoring throughout the treatment. Thus, while non-selective NO synthase inhibitors have therapeutic utility provided that appropriate precautions are taken, NO synthase inhibitors which are selective in the sense that they inhibit the inducible NO synthase to a considerably greater extent than the constitutive isoforms of NO synthase would be of even greater therapeutic benefit and easier to use.</p><p>WO94/12165, WO94/14780, WO93/13055, EPO440699A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,453 disclose compounds that inhibit nitric oxide synthesis and preferentially inhibit the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase.

The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be store: in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline, water-for-injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.</p><p>Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol.</p><p>Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.</p><p>Formulations for administration by inhalation can be prepared for use as an aerolized medicaments such as in a manner recited in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,135 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,150.</p><p>Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as hereinbelow recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.</p><p>It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.</p><p>The compounds of the invention may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from 0.001 to 2500 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 0.005 mg to 10 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the invention which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg.</p><p>The compounds of formula (I) are preferably administered orally or by injection (intravenous or subcutaneous). The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. However, the dose employed will depend on a number of factors, including the age and sex of the patient, the precise disorder being treated, and its severity.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 87, 682-685, 1990 and Misko et al, Eur. J. Pharm., 23, 119-125, 1993). Human inducible NOS (hiNOS), human endothelial constitutive NOS (hecNOS) and human neuronal constitutive NOS (hncNOS) were each cloned from RNA extracted from human tissue. The cDNA for human inducible NOS (hiNOS) was isolated from a λcDNA library made from RNA extracted from a colon sample from a patient with ulcerative colitis. The cDNA for human endothelial constitutive NOS (hecNOS) was isolated from a λcDNA library made from RNA extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the cDNA for human neuronal constitutive NOS (hncNOS) was isolated from a λcDNA library made from RNA extracted from human cerebellum obtained from a cadaver. The recombinant enzymes were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus vector (Rodi et al, in The Biology of Nitric Oxide, Pt. 4: Enzymology, Biochemistry and Immunology; Moncada, S., Feelisch, M., Busse, R., Higgs, E., Eds.; Portland Press Ltd.: London, 1995; pp 447-450). Enzyme activity was isolated from soluble cell extracts and partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. To measure NOS activity, 10 μL of enzyme was added to 40 μL of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6) in the presence or absence of test compounds and the reaction initiated by the addition of 50 μL of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 2.0 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 2.0 mM DTT, 4.0 mM CaCl.sub.2, 20 μM FAD, 100 μM tetrahydrobiopterin, 0.4-2.0 mM NADPH and 60 μM L-arginine containing 0.9 μCi of L-[2,3-.sup.3 H]-arginine. The final concentration of L-arginine in the assay was 30 μM. For hecNOS, and hncNOS, calmodulin was included at a final concentration of 40-100 mM. Following incubation at 37 of 300 μL of cold stop buffer containing 10 mM EGTA, 100 mM HEPES, pH 5.5 and 1 mM citrulline. [.sup.3 H]-Citrulline was separated by chromatography on Dowex 50W X-8 cation exchange resin and radioactivity determined with a liquid scintillation counter. Results are reported in Table I as the IC.sub.50 values of compounds for hiNOS, hecNOS and hncNOS. Compounds giving less than 50% inhibition at 100 μM were reported as having IC.sub.50 values of &amp;gt;100 μM and compounds giving greater than 50% inhibition at 100 μM were reported as having IC.sub.50 values of &amp;lt;100 μM.</p><p>RAW cell nitrite assay</p><p>RAW 264.7 cells are plated to confluency on a 96-well tissue culture plate grown overnight (17 h) in the presence of LPS to induce NOS. A row of 3-6 wells were left untreated and served as controls for subtraction of nonspecific background. The media was removed from each well and the cells are washed twice with Krebs-Ringers-Hepes (25mM, pH 7.4) with 2 mg/ml glucose. The cells are then placed on ice and incubated with 50 μL of buffer containing L-arginine (30 μM) +/- inhibitors for 1 h. The assay is initiated by warming the plate to 37 h. Production of nitrite by intracellular iNOS is linear with time. To terminate the cellular assay, the plate of cells is placed on ice and the nitrite-containing buffer removed and analyzed for nitrite (Misko et al, Anal. Biochem., 214, 11-16, 1993). All values are the average of triplicate wells and are compared to a background-subtracted induced set of cells (100% value).
