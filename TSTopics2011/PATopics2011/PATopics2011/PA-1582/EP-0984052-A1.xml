therefrom, to a method of making such compositions and films, and to products made
therefrom. In another aspect, the present invention relates to adhesive composition
comprising a terpolymer of an α-olefin, carbon monoxide and an ethylenically
unsaturated carboxylic ester monomer, and further comprising a thermosetting resin,
to films made therefrom, to a method of making such compositions and films, and to
products made therefrom.</p><p num="0002">Decorative laminates prepared by heat and pressure consolidation have been
produced commercially for a number of years, and have found widespread acceptance
in the building and furniture industry as counter and table tops, bathroom and kitchen
work surfaces, wall paneling, partitions and doors. Such decorative laminates can be
described as containing a number of laminae that are consolidated to form a unitary
structure carrying a surface decoration which can range from something as simple as a
solid color to something as complex as an embossed simulated wood grain finish.</p><p num="0003">More specifically, a decorative laminate generally comprises plural layers of
synthetic resin impregnated paper sheets consolidated or bonded together into a
unitary structure under heat and pressure. In normal practice the decorative laminate
assembly, from the bottom up, consists of a core of one or more sheets impregnated
with phenolic resin, above which lies a decorative sheet impregnated with melamine
resin. </p><p num="0004">The core or base member functions to impart rigidity to the laminate and
usually comprises a solid substrate which may or may not be formed prior to the
initial laminating step. Prior to stacking, the sheets of the core member are
impregnated with water alcohol solution of phenol formaldehyde, dried and partially
cured in a hot air oven, and finally cut into sheets. Examples of such a base or core
member include a plurality of sheets of 90 to 150 pound ream kraft paper impregnated
throughout and bonded with a substantially completely cured phenolic resin which has
been converted to the thermoset state during the initial laminating step, a precured
plastic laminate, such as glass fiber-reinforced thermoset polyester resin laminates and
the like, a wood product, such as hardboard, woodwaste or particle boards, plywood,
and the like, a meneral base board, such as cement-asbestos board, sheet rock, plaster
board, and the like, or a combination of these substrates.</p><p num="0005">The decorative sheet generally functions to give an attractive appearance to the
laminate, and also gives the panel its surface characteristics (i.e. resistance to chemical
agents, to heat, to light, to shock and to abrasion). It is generally high quality 50 to
125 ream weight, pigment filled, alpha cellulose paper that has been impregnated with
a solution of melamine-formaldehyde resin, dried and partially cured, and finally cut
into sheets. The decorative sheet, prior to impregnation with the resin, may be of a
solid color or may comprise a decorative design, or a photo-gravure reproduction of
natural materials, such as wood marble, leather, etc.</p><p num="0006">The decorative laminate is generally obtained by placing the resin impregnated
core and decorative sheets between steel plates and subjecting the laminate stack to
temperatures in the range of about 200°F to about 350°F and pressures in the range of 
about 800-1600 psi for a time sufficient to consolidate the laminate and cure the resins
(generally about 25 minutes to an hour). This causes the resin in the paper sheets
to flow, cure and consolidate the sheets into a unitary laminated mass referred in the
art as a decorative high-pressure laminate. Continuous methods are also know for
making decorative laminates.</p><p num="0007">Generally, more than one laminate is formed at one time by inserting a
plurality of assembled sheets in a stack with each assembly being separated by a
release sheet which allows the individual laminates to be separated after
consolidation.</p><p num="0008">Finally, the decorative laminates so formed are then bonded to a reinforcing
substrate, such as plywood, hardboard, asbestos board, particle board or the like, by
the use of adhesives such as contact adhesives, urea- formaldehyde, white flues
(polyvinyl acetate emulsions) hot melts, phenolic or resorcinol-formaldehyde epoxy,
coal tar, animal glues, and the like. The glues vary in their cost and
reliability. Very commonly the type of glue used in the industry is either a
solvent based contact adhesive, or a water-based contact adhesive. An example of a
common specific glue used is a polyvinyl acetate emulsion contact adhesive.</p><p num="0009">While these water-based or solvent-based this olyvinyl acetate emulsion
glue are inexpensive and reliable, they must be applied at the time of application of
the decorative laminate to the substrate since they set up in relatively short order, and
are applied in liquid form which may cause application difficulties.</p><p num="0010">There is a need in the art for an adhesive which can be applied to the
decorative laminate far in advance of adhering the decorative laminate to the
substrate. </p><p num="0011">There is another need in the art for an adhesive which does not need to be
applied in liquid form.</p><p num="0012">These and other needs in the art will become apparent to those of skill in the
art upon review of this specification, including its drawings and claims.</p><p num="0013">It is an object of the present invention to provide for an adhesive which can be
applied to the decorative laminate far in advance of adhering the decorative laminate
to the substrate.</p><p num="0014">It is another abject of the present invention to provide for an adhesive which
does not need to be applied in liquid form.</p><p num="0015">These and other object of the present invention will become apparent to those
of skill in the art upon review of this specification, including its drawings and claims.</p><p num="0016">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
composition which includes a terpolymer of an α-olefin, carbon monoxide and an
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic ester monomer, and further includes a
thermosetting resin. For the composition, the melt temperature of the terpolymer is
less than the set temperature of the thermosetting resin. A further embodiment of
making the composition would include contacting together the above described
components to form the composition.</p><p num="0017">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided
an adhesive film made from the above composition.</p><p num="0018">According to even another embodiment, there is provided a method of making
the above film. The method generally includes heating the above composition, to a

provided a product with an adhesive backing. The product generally includes a
substrate with the above described film affixed to the substrate.</p><p num="0020">According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, there is

added at the main feed throat by gravity. The main feed throat is located in the first
barrel segment of the extruder. The base polymer and all additives were metered into
the main feed throat with volumetric feeders which calibrated to deliver the amount of 
material required for the experiments. Material extruded from the die was passed
through a 3 roll stack. The chromed rolls of the stack were actively cooled to prevent
the film from sticking to them. Typically the temperature of the cooled rolls was
5-10°C. The plastic film was stored at room temperature.</p><heading><u style="single">MATERIALS</u></heading><p num="0041">The chemicals used for the experiments were all of commercial quality.

to melt and process the base polymer into film but kept at a low enough temperature
so that the powdered melamine resin or powdered phenolic resin do not noticeably
react with the base polymer or with themselves to increase the viscosity to the point
that films cannot be extruded from the die. This is especially important because these
powdered melamine and phenolic resins have the ability to crosslink in the extruder 
which will require extensive maintenance to free the screws and resume normal
operation of the extruder.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 1 (Elvaloy 742 Control)</u></heading><p num="0043">Neat base polymer, Elvaloy 742, was added to the twin screw extruder at a rate
of 15 pounds per hour. The barrels were heated to 70°C and the die was heated to
80°C. The 3 three rolls of the calendar were cooled to 5°C. A film was extruded and
passed through the 3 roll stack where pressure between the rolls produced a smooth
surfaced film of approximately 0.006 inches thick. This film acted as a control for
subsequent samples which contained additives.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 2 (Elvaloy 742)</u></heading><p num="0044">Neat base polymer, Elvaloy 742, was metered into the main feed throat of the
twin screw extruder at a rate of 12 pounds per hour. Also metered into the main feed
throat was 3 pounds per hour of GP-5520, powdered phenolic resin. The barrels were
maintained at 70°C and the die was set at 80°C. Cooling is possible on the barrels but
the die is air cooled only. The extruded film is light yellow in color and homogenous
to the naked eye. This procedure was repeated for the conditions with increasing
amounts of GP-5520 until the ratio of GP-5520 to base polymer approached 1 in
which case the material no longer produced an extrudable film.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 3 (Elvaloy 4924 Control)</u></heading><p num="0045">Same procedure as Example 1, except that Elvaloy 4924 was substituted for
Elvaloy 742.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 4 (Elvaloy) 4924)</u></heading><p num="0046">Same procedure as Example 2, except that Elvaloy 4924 was substituted for

Testing</u></heading><heading><u style="single">Preparation of bonded film samples</u></heading><p num="0049">Extruded film made as described above was sandwiched between a piece of
standard grade laminate (commercially available Wilsonart brand laminate grade 107,
0.050 inches thick ) the sanded side of the laminate, and a piece of clean 0.75 inch
thick, 45 pound industrial particle board. The samples were cut to measure 6 x 6
inches square. This formed sandwich was then placed in a quick closing, hydraulic
press with preheated plattens at 325°F. A piece of paperbacked, aluminum foil was
placed between the platens and the laminate surface and particle board surface to
prevent any material from contaminating the plattens during the press cycle. The press
was closed and pressure maintained at 66 pounds per square inch (psi) for 30 seconds.
The press was opened after 30 seconds and the sample was immediately removed and
allowed to cool to room temperature without additional pressure on its surfaces.</p><heading><u style="single">Preparation of Plug Samples</u></heading><p num="0050">The bonded film samples made as described above, were cut into strips 2.5
inches wide and at least 5.25 inches long. No effort was made to maintain the machine
direction orientation of the extruded film. The face or decorative laminate side was
drilled with a 1.75 inch outside diameter hole saw bit, equipped with a 0.25 inch pilot 
high speed drill bit long enough to penetrate the backside of the particle board when
the large diameter bit has penetrated the laminate and film. The distance the large
diameter hole saw bit penetrates must be at least the thickness of the high pressure
laminate and extruded film, but not more than 0.0625 inches into the particle board, so
that the plane between the extruded film and particle board has been severed. If done
manually with a drill press the operator will sense when the particle board has been
reached. The next step is to drill from the backside with a 1.00 inch wood boring bit,
also known as a paddle bit. Using the pilot hole from the previous step, drill until the
wood boring bit removes all of the particle board but does not remove any of the high
pressure decorative laminate.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 8 Instron Testing</u></heading><p num="0051">A model 4204 Instron machine was used to quantitate the bond strength
between the laminate-extruded film-particle board interfaces. The Instron unit was
equipped with a 10,000 pound load cell. The Instron was programmed to pull the
sample apart at a rate of 1 inch per minute. Failure of the bond was noted by a
decrease in the tension as the sample was pulled apart. The data were recorded by an
automated program and five plugs were run of each experimental condition. The
Instron program calculated the mean, standard deviation and mediam stress values in
pounds per square inch (psi) at maximum load for each set of five plugs. These values
are reported in Tables 2 and 5.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 9 Creep Rupture Testing</u></heading><p num="0052">The bonded film samples described above were cut into strips 2.0 inches wide
and 5.0 inches long. A bandsaw was used to make a cut into the decorative side of the
high pressure laminate. The cut was located 2.5 inches from what will become the
load end of the sample. This cut was made through the decorative side of the high 
pressure laminate, through the extruded film, and 0.0625 inches into the particle
board. From the backside, remove particle board so that 0.5 inches by 2.0 inches of
high pressure decorative laminate are exposed. Drill a 0.25 inch hole in the center of
the exposed piece of hpl. Secure the sample decorative side down in a holding device.
Secure a 20 pound weight through the hole to the sample being tested. The samples
were placed in controlled temperature room at approximately 72 degrees F. Record
the time that the experiment starts and then record when the sample fails and the
weight drops away from the structure. Results are provided in Tables III and VI.
