The phrases "rubber or elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation" or "diene based rubbers" are intended to include both natural rubber and its various raw and reclaim forms as well as various synthetic rubbers. In the description of this invention, the terms "rubber" and " elastomer" may be used interchangeably, unless otherwise prescribed. The terms "rubber composition", "compounded rubber" and "rubber compound" are used interchangeably to refer to rubber which has been blended or mixed with various ingredients and materials. Representative synthetic polymers are the homopolymerization products of butadiene and its homologues and derivatives, for example, methylbutadiene, dimethylbutadiene and pentadiene as well as copolymers such as those formed from butadiene or its homologues or derivatives with other unsaturated monomers. Among the latter are acetylenes, for example, vinyl acetylene; olefins, for example, isobutylene, which copolymerizes with isoprene to form butyl rubber; vinyl compounds, for example, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile (which polymerize with butadiene to form NBR), methacrylic acid and styrene, the latter compound polymerizing with butadiene to form SBR, as well as vinyl esters and various unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and ethers, e.g., acrolein, methyl isopropenyl ketone and vinylethyl ether. Specific examples of synthetic rubbers include neoprene (polychloroprene), polybutadiene (including cis-1,4-polybutadiene), polyisoprene<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> (including cis-1,4-polyisoprene), butyl rubber, halobutyl rubber such as chlorobutyl rubber or bromobutyl rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, copolymers of 1,3-butadiene or isoprene with monomers such as styrene, acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate, as well as ethylene/propylene terpolymers, also known as ethylene/propylene/diene monomer (EPDM), and in particular, ethylene/propylene/ dicyclopentadiene terpolymers. Additional examples of rubbers which may be used include alkoxy-silyl end functionalized solution polymerized polymers (SBR, PBR, IBR and SIBR), silicon-coupled and tin-coupled star-branched polymers. The preferred rubber or elastomers are natural rubber, synthetic polyisoprene, polybutadiene and SBR.</p><p num="p0017">In one aspect the rubber is preferably of at least two of diene based rubbers. For example, a combination of two or more rubbers is preferred such as cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural or synthetic, although natural is preferred), 3,4-polyisoprene rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, emulsion and solution polymerization derived styrene/butadiene rubbers, cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubbers and emulsion polymerization prepared butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers.</p><p num="p0018">In one aspect of this invention, an emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (E-SBR) might be used having a relatively conventional styrene content of 20 to 28 percent bound styrene or, for some applications, an E-SBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content, namely, a bound styrene content of 30 to 45 percent.</p><p num="p0019">The relatively high styrene content of 30 to 45 for the E-SBR can be considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing traction, or skid resistance, of the tire tread. The presence of the E-SBR itself is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing processability of the uncured elastomer composition mixture, especially in comparison to a utilization of a solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR).</p><p num="p0020">By emulsion polymerization prepared E-SBR, it is meant that styrene and 1,3-butadiene are copolymerized as an aqueous emulsion. The bound styrene content can vary, for example, from 5 to 50 percent. In one aspect, the E-SBR may also contain acrylonitrile to form a terpolymer rubber, as E-SBAR, in amounts, for example, of 2 to 30 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the terpolymer.</p><p num="p0021">Emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubbers containing 2 to 40 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the copolymer are also contemplated as diene based rubbers for use in this<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> invention.</p><p num="p0022">The solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR) typically has a bound styrene content in a range of 5 to 50, preferably 9 to 36, percent.</p><p num="p0023">A purpose of using S-SBR is for improved tire rolling resistance as a result of lower hysteresis when it is used in a tire tread composition.</p><p num="p0024">The rubber composition may optionally include from 0 to 20 phr of 3,4-polyisoprene rubber. The 3,4-polyisoprene rubber (3,4-PI) is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tire's traction when it is used in a tire tread composition. The Tg refers to the glass transition temperature which can conveniently be determined by a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating rate of 10¬∞C per minute.</p><p num="p0025">The cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber (BR) is considered to be beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tire tread's wear, or treadwear. Such BR can be prepared, for example, by organic solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. The BR may be conveniently characterized, for example, by having at least a 90 percent cis 1,4-content.</p><p num="p0026">The term "phr" as used herein, and according to conventional practice, refers to "parts by weight of a respective material per 100 parts by weight of rubber, or elastomer."</p><p num="p0027">The rubber composition may also include up to 70 phr of processing oil. Processing oil may be included in the rubber composition as extending oil typically used to extend elastomers. Processing oil may also be included in the rubber composition by addition of the oil directly during rubber compounding. The processing oil used may include both extending oil present in the elastomers, and process oil added during compounding. Suitable process oils include various oils as are known in the art, including aromatic, paraffinic, naphthenic, vegetable oils, and low PCA oils, such as MES, TDAE, SRAE and heavy naphthenic oils.</p><p num="p0028">In one embodiment, the rubber composition includes a low PCA oil. Suitable low PCA oils include but are not limited to mild extraction solvates (MES), treated distillate aromatic extracts (TDAE), and heavy naphthenic oils as are known in the art; see for example <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5504135B" status="new"><text>US-B- 5,504,135</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="US6103808B" status="new"><text>US-B- 6,103,808</text></patcit>.

phthalocyanine resulted in a rubber compound having similar physical properties as compared with the control. Significantly, the total amount of zinc metal in sample 2 is much lower than in sample 1, owing to the greater molecular weight of the zinc phthalocyanine (577.9 vs 81.4 for zinc oxide). The total zinc in sample 2 was therefore about 0.14 phr (as zinc metal), while that for sample 1 was about 2 phr (as zinc metal). Through use of the zinc phthalocyanine, then, a satisfactory cured rubber compound is obtained with a much lower zinc content than for the compound with zinc oxide. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the zinc content of the rubber compound was reduced by a factor on the order of 10 without reduction in physical properties of the cured rubber.</p><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLE 2</u></heading><p num="p0056">In this example, the effect of replacing zinc oxide with a substituted zinc porphyrin compound in a sulfur cured rubber compound is illustrated.
