additive for lubricating oils, comprising a mixture of alkaline earth metal salts
(hydrocarbyl phenate/hydrocarbyl salicylate) and a reduced amount of
unreacted hydrocarbyl phenols, as well as additive packages, concentrates
and finished oil compositions comprising the same. Specifically, it relates to
additives comprising said mixture in which said hydrocarbyl salicylate is
primarily single-aromatic-ring hydrocarbyl salicylate.</p><p num="0010">The present invention also provides a method for producing the above
described additive, which comprises the neutralization of hydrocarbyl phenols
using an alkaline earth base in the presence of a promoter to produce a
hydrocarbyl phenate. Preferably, said promoter comprises at least one
carboxylic acid containing from one to four carbon atoms, and said
neutralization step is carried out in the absence of alkali base, in the absence
of dialcohol, and in the absence of monoalcohol. The neutralization step is
followed by carboxylation of the hydrocarbyl phenate produced in the
neutralization step; and separation of the starting hydrocarbyl phenols from
the product of the carboxylation step.</p><p num="0011">The hydrocarbyl phenols may comprise a mixture of linear and /or branched
hydrocarbyl constituents. For example, the hydrocarbyl phenols may be
made up entirely of linear hydrocarbyl phenol, entirely of branched
hydrocarbyl phenol, or a mixture of both. Preferably, the hydrocarbyl phenols
contain up to 85% of linear hydrocarbyl phenol in mixture with at least 15% of
branched hydrocarbyl phenol in which the branched hydrocarbyl radical 
contains at least nine carbon atoms. More preferably, the hydrocarbyl
phenols are alkylphenols which contain from 35% to 85% of linear alkylphenol
in mixture with from 15% to 65% of branched alkylphenol. The ratio of
branched versus linear alkylphenol is given by weight. Preferably, the linear
hydrocarbyl radical contains 12 to 40 carbon atoms, more preferably from 18
to 30 carbon atoms, and, if branched hydrocarbyl phenols are present, the
branched hydrocarbyl radical contains at least 9 carbon atoms, preferably
from 9 to 24 carbon atoms, more preferably 10 to 15 carbon atoms.</p><p num="0012">Preferably, the alkaline earth base is selected from the group consisting of
calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0013">Preferably, the carboxylic acid is a mixture of formic acid and acetic acid,
more preferably a 50/50 by weight mixture of formic and acetic acid.</p><p num="0014">Preferably, the neutralization step is carried out at a temperature of at least
200°C, more preferably at least 215°C. The pressure is reduced gradually
below atmospheric in order to remove the water of reaction, in the absence of
any solvent that may form an azeotrope with water. Preferably, the quantities
of reagents used correspond to the following molar ratios:
<sl><li>(1) alkaline earth base/alkylphenol of from 0.2:1 to 0.7:1, more
preferably from 0.3:1 to 0.5:1; and</li><li>(2) carboxylic acid/alkyl phenol of from 0.01:1 to 0.5:1, more
preferably from 0.03:1 to 0.15:1.</li></sl></p><p num="0015">In one embodiment, the neutralization step is carried out at a temperature of
at least 240°C with a gradual reduction in pressure below atmospheric so as
to reach a pressure of no more than 7,000 Pa (70 mbars) at 240°C.</p><p num="0016">The hydrocarbyl phenate obtained in the neutralization step is carboxylated in
order to convert at least 20 mole % of the starting hydrocarbyl phenols to 
hydrocarbyl salicylate using carbon dioxide under carboxylation conditions.
Preferably, at least 22 mole % of the starting hydrocarbyl phenols is
converted, and this conversion occurs at a temperature between 180°C and
240°C, under a pressure within the range of from above atmospheric
pressure to 15×10<sup>5</sup> Pa (15 bars) for a period of one to eight hours.</p><p num="0017">More preferably, the starting hydrocarbyl phenols are alkylphenols and at
least 25 mole % of the starting alkylphenols is converted to alkylsalicylate
using carbon dioxide at a temperature equal to or greater than 200°C, under a
pressure of 4×10<sup>5</sup> Pa (4 bars).</p><p num="0018">The hydrocarbyl salicylate produced in the carboxylation step carboxylation
step may comprise both single-aromatic-ring hydrocarbyl salicylate and
double-aromatic-ring hydrocarbyl salicylate. Preferably, the mole ratio of
single-aromatic-ring hydrocarbyl salicylate to double-aromatic-ring
hydrocarbyl salicylate is at least 8:1.</p><p num="0019">Preferably, the product of the carboxylation step is then filtered to remove any
sediment formed in the carboxylation step.</p><p num="0020">The product of the carboxylation step is then subjected to a separation
procedure such as solvent extraction, distillation, membrane filtration, and the
like wherein at least about 10% of the starting hydrocarbyl phenols are
separated from the product of the carboxylation step. Preferably, at least
about 30% to about 55% of the starting hydrocarbyl phenols are separated.
More preferably, at least about 45% to about 50% of the starting hydrocarbyl
phenols are separated from the product of the carboxylation step.</p><p num="0021">Once the starting hydrocarbyl phenols are separated from the product of the
carboxylation step, said hydrocarbyl phenols may advantageously be recycled
to be used as starting materials in the process of the present invention or in
any other process. </p><p num="0022">Preferably, the separation step is performed via distillation, more preferably
via falling film distillation or short path distillation, most preferably via wiped
film evaporator distillation. Said distillation is carried out at a temperature of
from about 150°C to about 250°C and at a pressure of about 0.1 to about 4
mbar; more preferably from about 190°C to about 230°C and at about 0.5 to
about 3 mbar; most preferably from about 195°C to about 225°C and at a
pressure of about 1 to about 2 mbar.</p><p num="0023">The unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive of the present invention
may advantageously be blended with an effective viscosity improving amount
of organic diluent. Preferably, enough diluent is added so that said diluent
makes up from about 10% to about 80% by weight of the blended product.
More preferably, said diluent makes up from about 20% to about 50% by
weight of the blended product. Suitable diluents include Group 1 or Group 2
base oils such as 100N base oil; organic solvents such as pentane, heptane,
benzene, toluene and the like; and other suitable organic compounds such as
hydrocarbyl phenols which may advantageously be recycled from the
distillation step of the present invention.</p><p num="0024">The unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive produced by this method
has the following composition:

hydrocarbyl salicylate, and</li><li>(d) 0% to 50% organic diluent.</li></sl></p><p num="0025">In one embodiment, the unsulfurized carboxylate-containing additive
comprises from 0 to 35% hydrocarbyl phenol; preferably from 0 to 30% 
hydrocarbyl phenol; more preferably from 0 to 20% hydrocarbyl phenol; most
preferably from 0 to 15% hydrocarbyl phenol.</p><p num="0026">The unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive may also comprise an
alkaline earth metal double-aromatic-ring hydrocarbyl salicylate, but the mole
ratio of single-aromatic-ring hydrocarbyl salicylate to double-aromatic-ring
hydrocarbyl salicylate will be at least 8:1.</p><p num="0027">The unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive produced by the method of

promoter. In one embodiment, said hydrocarbyl phenols are neutralized
using an alkaline earth metal base in the presence of at least one C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>
carboxylic acid. Preferably, this reaction is carried out in the absence of alkali
base, and in the absence of dialcohol or monoalcohol.</p><p num="0038">The hydrocarbyl phenols may contain up to 100% linear hydrocarbyl groups,
up to 100% branched hydrocarbyl groups, or both linear and branched
hydrocarbyl groups. Preferably, the linear hydrocarbyl group, if present, is
alkyl, and the linear alkyl radical contains 12 to 40 carbon atoms, more
preferably 18 to 30 carbon atoms. The branched hydrocarbyl radical, if
present, is preferably alkyl and contains at least nine carbon atoms,
preferably 9 to 24 carbon atoms, more preferably 10 to 15 carbon atoms. In
one embodiment, the hydrocarbyl phenols contain up to 85% of linear
hydrocarbyl phenol (preferably at least 35% linear hydrocarbyl phenol) in
mixture with at least 15% of branched hydrocarbyl phenol.</p><p num="0039">The use of an alkylphenol containing at least 35% of long-chain linear
alkylphenol (from 18 to 30 carbon atoms) is particularly attractive because a
long linear alkyl chain promotes the compatibility and solubility of the additives
in lubricating oils. However, the presence of relatively heavy linear alkyl
radicals in the alkylphenols can make the latter less reactive than branched
alkylphenols, hence the need to use harsher reaction conditions to bring
about their neutralization by an alkaline earth metal base.</p><p num="0040">Branched alkylphenols can be obtained by reaction of phenol with a branched
olefin, generally originating from propylene. They consist of a mixture of
monosubstituted isomers, the great majority of the substituents being in the
para position, very few being in the ortho position, and hardly any in the meta 
position. That makes them relatively more reactive towards an alkaline earth
metal base, since the phenol function is practically devoid of steric hindrance.</p><p num="0041">On the other hand, linear alkylphenols can be obtained by reaction of phenol
with a linear olefin, generally originating from ethylene. They consist of a
mixture of monosubstituted isomers in which the proportion of linear alkyl
substituents in the ortho, para, and meta positions is more uniformly
distributed. This makes them less reactive towards an alkaline earth metal
base since the phenol function is less accessible due to considerable steric
hindrance, due to the presence of closer and generally heavier alkyl
substituents. Of course, linear alkylphenols may contain alkyl substituents
with some branching which increases the amount of para substituents and,
resultantly, increases the relative reactivity towards alkaline earth metal
bases.</p><p num="0042">The alkaline earth metal bases that can be used for carrying out this step
include the oxides or hydroxides of calcium, magnesium, barium, or
strontium, and particularly of calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium
oxide, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, slaked lime (calcium
hydroxide) is preferred.</p><p num="0043">The promoter used in this step can be any material that enhances
neutralization. For example, the promoter may be a polyhydric alcohol,
dialcohol, monoalcohol, ethylene glycol or any carboxylic acid. Preferably, a
carboxylic acid is used. More preferably, C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> carboxylic acids are used in
this step including, for example, formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid, and
may be used alone or in mixture. Preferably, a mixture of acids is used, most
preferably a formic acid/acetic acid mixture. The molar ratio of formic
acid/acetic acid should be from 0.2:1 to 100:1, preferably between 0.5:1 and
4:1, and most preferably 1:1. The carboxylic acids act as transfer agents,
assisting the transfer of the alkaline earth metal bases from a mineral reagent
to an organic reagent. </p><p num="0044">The neutralization operation is carried out at a temperature of at least 200°C,
preferably at least 215°C, and more preferably at least 240°C The pressure
is reduced gradually below atmospheric in order to distill off the water of
reaction. Accordingly the neutralization should be conducted in the absence
of any solvent that may form an azeotrope with water. Preferably, the
pressure is reduced to no more than 7,000 Pa (70 mbars).</p><p num="0045">The quantities of reagents used should correspond to the following molar
ratios:
<sl><li>(1) alkaline earth metal base/ hydrocarbyl phenol of 0.2:1 to 0.7:1,
preferably 0.3:1 to 0.5:1; and</li><li>(2) carboxylic acid/ hydrocarbyl phenol of 0.01:1 to 0.5:1, preferably
from 0.03:1 to 0.15:1.</li></sl></p><p num="0046">Preferably, at the end of this neutralization step the hydrocarbyl phenate
obtained is kept for a period not exceeding fifteen hours at a temperature of
at least 215°C and at an absolute pressure of between 5,000 and 10<sup>5</sup> Pa
(between 0.05 and 1.0 bar). More preferably, at the end of this neutralization
step the hydrocarbyl phenate obtained is kept for between two and six hours
at an absolute pressure of between 10,000 and 20,000 Pa (between 0.1 and
0.2 bar).</p><p num="0047">By providing that operations are carried out at a sufficiently high temperature
and that the pressure in the reactor is reduced gradually below atmospheric,
the neutralization reaction is carried out without the need to add a solvent that
forms an azeotrope with the water formed during this reaction.</p><heading>B. <u style="single">CARBOXYLATION STEP</u></heading><p num="0048">The carboxylation step is conducted by simply bubbling carbon dioxide into
the reaction medium originating from the preceding neutralization step and is 
continued until at least 20 mole % of the starting hydrocarbyl phenols is
converted to hydrocarbyl salicylate (measured as salicylic acid by
potentiometric determination). It must take place under pressure in order to
avoid any decarboxylation of the alkylsalicylate that forms.</p><p num="0049">Preferably, at least 22 mole % of the starting hydrocarbyl phenols is
converted to hydrocarbyl salicylate using carbon dioxide at a temperature of
between 180°C and 240°C, under a pressure within the range of from above
atmospheric pressure to 15×10<sup>5</sup> Pa (15 bars) for a period of one to eight
hours.</p><p num="0050">According to one variant, at least 25 mole % of the starting hydrocarbyl
phenols is converted to hydrocarbyl salicylate using carbon dioxide at a
temperature equal to or greater than 200°C under a pressure of 4×10<sup>5</sup> Pa (4
bars).</p><heading>C. <u style="single">FILTRATION STEP</u></heading><p num="0051">The product of the carboxylation step may advantageously be filtered. The
purpose of the filtration step is to remove sediments, and particularly
crystalline calcium carbonate, which might have been formed during the
preceding steps, and which may cause plugging of filters installed in
lubricating oil circuits.</p><heading>D. <u style="single">SEPARATION STEP</u></heading><p num="0052">At least 10% of the starting hydrocarbyl phenol is separated form the product
of the carboxylation step. Preferably, the separation is accomplished using
distillation. More preferably, the distillation is carried out in a wiped film
evaporator at a temperature of from about 150°C to about 250°C and at a
pressure of about 0.1 to about 4 mbar; more preferably from about 190°C to
about 230°C and at about 0.5 to about 3 mbar; most preferably from about
195°C to about 225°C and at a pressure of about 1 to about 2 mbar. At least 
10% of the starting hydrocarbyl phenol is separated. More preferably, at least
30% of the starting hydrocarbyl phenol is separated. Most preferably, up to
55% of the starting hydrocarbyl phenol is separated. The separated
hydrocarbyl phenol may then be recycled to be used as starting materials in
the novel process or in any other process.</p><heading><b>UNSULFURIZED, CARBOXYLATE-CONTAINING ADDITVE</b></heading><p num="0053">The unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive formed by the present
process can be characterized by its unique composition, with much more
alkaline earth metal single-aromatic-ring hydrocarbyl salicylate and less
hydrocarbyl phenol than produced by other routes. When the hydrocarbyl
group is an alkyl group, the unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive has
the following composition;
<sl><li>(a) less than 40% alkylphenol,</li><li>(b) from 10% to 50% alkaline earth metal alkylphenate, and</li><li>(b) from 15% to 60% alkaline earth metal single-aromatic-ring
alkylsalicylate.</li></sl></p><p num="0054">Unlike alkaline earth metal alkylsalicylates produced by other process, this
unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive composition can be
characterized by having only minor amounts of an alkaline earth metal
double-aromatic-ring alkylsalicylates. The mole ratio of single-aromatic-ring
alkylsalicylate to double-aromatic-ring alkylsalicylate is at least 8:1.</p><heading><b>CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PRODUCT BY INFRARED
SPECTROMETRY</b></heading><p num="0055">Out-of-aromatic-ring-plane C-H bending vibrations were used to characterize
the unsulfurized carboxylate-containing additive of the present invention. </p><p num="0056">Infrared spectra of aromatic rings show strong out-of-plane C-H bending
transmittance band in the 675-870 cm<sup>-1</sup> region, the exact frequency
depending upon the number and location of substituents. For orthodisubstituted
compounds, transmittance band occurs at 735-770 cm<sup>-1</sup>. For
para-disubstituted compounds, transmittance band occurs at 810-840 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p num="0057">Infrared spectra of reference chemical structures relevant to the present
invention indicate that the out-of-plane C-H bending transmittance band
occurs at 750±3 cm<sup>-1</sup> for ortho-alkylphenols, at 760±2 cm<sup>-1</sup> for salicylic acid,
and at 832±3 cm<sup>-1</sup> for para-alkylphenols.</p><p num="0058">Alkaline earth alkylphenates known in the art have infrared out-of-plane C-H
bending transmittance bands at 750±3 cm<sup>-1</sup> and at 832±3 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Alkaline earth
alkylsalicylates known in the art have infrared out-of-plane C-H bending
transmittance bands at 763±3 cm<sup>-1</sup> and at 832±3 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p num="0059">The unsulfurized carboxylate-containing additive of the present invention
shows essentially no out-of-plane C-H bending vibration at 763±3 cm<sup>-1</sup>, even
though there is other evidence that alkylsalicylate is present. This particular
characteristic has not been fully explained. However, it may be hypothesized
that the particular structure of the single aromatic ring alkylsalicylate prevents
in some way this out-of-plane C-H bending vibration. In this structure, the
carboxylic acid function is engaged in a cyclic structure, and thus may
generate increased steric hindrance in the vicinity of the aromatic ring, limiting
the free motion of the neighbor hydrogen atom. This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that the infrared spectrum of the acidified product (in which the
carboxylic acid function is no longer engaged in a cyclic structure and thus
can rotate) has an out-of-plane C-H transmittance band at 763±3 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p num="0060">The unsulfurized carboxylate-containing additive of the present invention can
thus be characterized by having a ratio of infrared transmittance band of out-of-plane 
C-H bending at about 763±3 cm<sup>-1</sup> to out-of-plane C-H bending at
832±3 cm<sup>-1</sup> of less than 0.1:1.</p><p num="0061">The unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive formed by this method,
being non-sulfurized, would provide improved high temperature deposit
control performance over sulfurized products. Being alkali-metal free, this
additive can be employed as a detergent-dispersant in applications, such as
marine engine oils, where the presence of alkali metals have proven to have
harmful effects.</p><heading><b>DETERGENTS</b></heading><p num="0062">The unsulfurized, carboxylate-containing additive formed by the process
described above has been found to provide improved bulk oxidation and
corrosion control performance when combined with other additives, including
detergents.</p><p num="0063">Detergents help control varnish, ring zone deposits, and rust by keeping
insoluble particles in colloidal suspension. Metal-containing (or ash-forming
detergents) function both as detergents to control deposits, and as acid
neutralizers or rust inhibitors, thereby reducing wear and corrosion and
extending engine life. Detergents generally comprise a polar head with a long
hydrophobic tail; with the polar head comprising a metal salt of an acidic
organic compound. The salts may contain a substantially stoichiometric
amount of the metal in which case they are usually described as normal or
neutral salts, and would typically have a total base number (as measured by
ASTM D2896) of from 0 to 10. It is possible to include large amounts of a
metal base by reacting an excess of a metal compound such as an oxide or
hydroxide with an acidic gas such as carbon dioxide to form an overbased
detergent. Such overbased detergents may have a total base number of
about 15 to 30 (low overbased); 31 to 170 (medium overbased); 171 to 400
(high overbased); or above 400 (high-high overbased). </p><p num="0064">Detergents that may be used include phenates, overbased phenates and

test is test method 48 of the Institute of Petroleum and can be found in
"Standard methods for analysis and testing of petroleum and related products
and British Standard 2000 parts, 2000, Methods IP-1-324, Volume 1"

In said test, air is bubbled through a lubricant sample which is kept at high
temperature. The viscosity of the end-of-test sample is compared to that of a
reference sample which has the exact same composition but is bubbled
through with nitrogen. The net viscosity increase (expressed as a percentage
increase) is an indication for the oxidation stability of a lubricant. The lower
the viscosity increase, the better.</p><heading><b>Corrosion Control (ASTM D6594-01 )</b></heading><p num="0135">This is a standard test method for evaluation of corrosiveness of diesel
engine oil at 135°C. This test method is used to test diesel engine lubricants
to determine their tendency to corrode various metals, specifically alloys of
lead and copper commonly used in cam followers and bearings. Four metal
specimens of copper, lead, tin, and phosphor bronze are immersed in a 
measured amount of engine oil. The oil, at an elevated temperature, is blown
with air for a period of time. When the test is completed, the copper
specimen and the stressed oil are examined to detect corrosion and corrosion
