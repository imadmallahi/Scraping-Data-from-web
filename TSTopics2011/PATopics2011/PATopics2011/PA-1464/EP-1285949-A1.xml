particularly to an ink for ink jet recording, and
more particularly to an ink, an ink set, an ink jet
recording method, an ink jet recording apparatus, a
recording unit and an ink cartridge suitable for
thermal ink jet recording system, that can provide a
recorded matter with little deterioration of image
quality over an prolonged time period.</p><heading>Related Background Art</heading><p num="0002">Recently, studies of ink jet ink containing
pigment as a coloring material have been energetically
conducted to meet the increasing need for further
improved image fastness (light fastness, gas fastness,
etc.).</p><p num="0003">As a result, the immediate problems of pigment
ink-jet inks, i.e., nozzle clogging in the head and
long-term storage instability of the ink, are
considerably improved.</p><p num="0004">Meanwhile, in order to obtain high-grade
photographic images by ink jet recording using ink
containing a water-soluble coloring material such as a
dye, there is a method to use light ink in addition to 
dark color inks (for example, yellow (Y) ink, cyan (C)
ink, magenta (M) ink and black (Bk) ink), where light
ink is an ink that forms images of the same color hue
as one of the dark inks does but has a lower coloring
power than the corresponding dark ink. Usually, light
cyan ink and light magenta ink are used as light ink.</p><p num="0005">Also in the ink jet recording system using inks
containing a water-insoluble coloring material such as
pigment inks, has been investigated a combination of
two inks that provide images of the same color but are
different in coloring power, that is, a combination of
a dark ink and a light ink. For example, WO 01/48100
discloses an ink set of a dark ink and a light ink both
containing a pigment and a dispersant where the ratio
(B1/P1) of the resin content (B1) to the pigment
content (P1) in the dark ink is smaller than the ratio
(B2/P2) of the resin content (B2) to the pigment
content (P2) in the light ink and B1 and B2 are
different. This provides an ink set that shows a
uniform permeability of the ink and gives a high
quality image with no surface roughness. Further, by
setting B1 larger B2, the light fastness of the light
ink can be improved to a level almost equivalent to the
light fastness of the dark ink. In addition, Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-179956 discloses
a technology for improving the roughness of the images
recorded with a dark ink and a light ink both 
containing a pigment and a dispersant, by rendering the
surface tension of the light ink lower than that of the
dark ink.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0006">As discussed above, technical information on
ink jet recording using dark and light inks
containing a pigment and a dispersant has been
accumulated, but it is not sufficient yet. Under
these circumstances, the present inventors have
studied the application of dark ink and light ink
containing a pigment and a dispersant to the thermal
ink jet recording system. In this study, the present
inventors have found that there is a tendency with a
light ink in a long term discharge test that the size
of an ink droplet becomes small at a low pulse (shot)
number in comparison with a dark ink and distortion
of ink droplet occurs, and the head life becomes
short. These results were unexpected, considering
that the light ink is lower in the solid content
(pigment, dispersant, etc.) than the dark ink. Thus
the inventors recognized these problems must be
solved for achieving further higher quality of an ink
jet image formed with inks containing a pigment and a
dispersant and also for improving reliability of a
printer loading such inks.</p><p num="0007">Thus, an object of the present invention is to 
provide an ink containing a water-insoluble coloring
material exhibiting excellent long-term discharge
properties when applied to a thermal ink jet
recording system and also permitting further
stabilization of ink jet recording.</p><p num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to
provide an ink set effective in further stably
forming a high-grade ink jet recording image.</p><p num="0009">A further object of the present invention is to
provide an ink jet recording method for being capable
of stably forming an ink jet recording image.</p><p num="0010">A still further object of the present invention
is to provide an ink cartridge, a recording unit and

above mentioned ink jet recording method.</p><p num="0011">According to one aspect of the present

and the ratio (B/P ratio) of the dispersant to the
coloring material is larger than 1.</p><p num="0030">By adopting such constitution, the problem of a
light pigment ink in the thermal ink jet recording
system, i.e. the change in the droplet size with time
will appear faster than the dark ink.</p><p num="0031">Although the reason why the constitution of the
present invention can solve this problem is not clear,
the present inventors considered on the basis of
their studies on the above mentioned problem that
when the B/P ratio in a light ink is almost equal to
that of a dark ink, the absolute amount of the 
dispersant present in the light ink is small so that
the dispersion state of the coloring material readily
would become unstable, in particular, in the vicinity
of the heater of a thermal ink jet head. To improve
this dispersion instability, the inventors added the
dispersant to a light ink in an amount that exceeds
the amount of the pigment, although the B/P ratio of
1 was regarded as the maximum value. As a result,
change in the droplet size with time and distortion
of the droplets were improved. This experimental
result supports the above presumption. Further, when
the B/P ratio is more preferably 1.2 or larger and
still more preferably 1.5 or larger in the present
invention, significant improvement is achieved in the
change of the droplet size and distortion of the
droplets.</p><p num="0032">The effect of the ink of the present invention
is more significant when a head with a liquid droplet
amount of 40 pl or less, more preferably 20 pl or
less, or particularly preferably 10 pl or less, is
employed.</p><p num="0033">In addition, as a secondary effect of the
present invention, there is improvement in light
fastness of an image formed with a light ink. In
general, particles of the color pigment for ink jet
recording are small in size in comparison with
pigments used for screen printing, etc., around 200 
nm or less, and particularly recently, mostly about
100 nm. Color pigments are preferably used in fields
of large posters or photographs requiring long-term
display so that printed on a recording medium called
coated paper or glossy paper having certain treated
surface. On such a recording medium, the pigment
particles in ink are not absorbed into the recording
medium and remain on the surface. Accordingly, the
pigment particles are directly exposed to light, so
that even pigments generally considered to have high
light fastness may also be faded after long-term
irradiation. In particular, light inks are subject
to fading because the amount of pigment on the paper
surface is small.</p><p num="0034">In the present invention, by increases the
ratio of a dispersant to a pigment in a light ink,
the light fastness is improved significantly. This
seems to be because fading by light is related to the
presence of oxygen and the dispersant on the paper
surface covers the pigment to shut off from the air,
whereby preventing light fading.</p><p num="0035">Incidentally, an ink jet ink containing 1% or
less coloring material in the ink is often used in
combination with an ink (dark ink) of the same color
hue but of a higher coloring power so as to form an
ink jet image at a level of silver halide photography
where the dots are inconspicuous and gradation is 
extremely smooth. However, the ink of the invention
is not necessarily used in combination with a dark
ink, but can of course be used alone. However, for
the sake of convenience, an ink with a concentration
of coloring material of 1% by weight or less relative
to the total ink amount is referred to as a "light
ink" herein.</p><p num="0036">In the ink of the present invention, the
concentration of a coloring material is 1% by weight
or less, preferably 0.9% by weight or less, and more
preferably 0.8% by weight or less in view of the aim
of the light ink that the edge of each dot should not
be seen, although it may vary depending on the kind
of coloring material and also on the proportion to
the concentration in the dark ink, etc when the inks
are used as an ink set. On the other hand, the lower
limit of the pigment concentration is 0.1% by weight
or more with respect to the total amount of the ink,
preferably 0.2% by weight or more and further
preferably 0.3% by weight or more in order for the
coloring power not to become too low.</p><heading>(Pigments)</heading><p num="0037">Pigments used for light inks relating to the
present invention will be described hereinafter.</p><p num="0038">Pigments used for black inks include, for
example, Carbon Black.</p><p num="0039">Examples of color pigments include, when

Green 7 and 36, and C.I. Pigment Brown 23, 25, and 26.</p><p num="0040">Of these, use of cyan and magenta pigments
remarkably shows the effect of the present invention.
In particular, use of at least one selected from the
group consisting of C.I. Pigment Red 122 of magenta
pigments, C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3 and C.I. Pigment
Blue 15:4 of cyan pigments gives preferable color and
balance of light fastness between a dark ink and a
light ink.</p><p num="0041">In addition, while the particle size of a
pigment to be used is not limited, it is preferably
200 nm or larger.</p><p num="0042">Now, in the present invention, a pigment of a
self-dispersion type and thus a pigment wherein
hydrophilic groups thereof are directly, or through
other atomic groups, bonded chemically to the pigment 
surfaces can be freely used as a coloring material in
combination with a pigment that can be dispersed in
an aqueous medium by the action of a dispersant.</p><heading>(Dispersants)</heading><p num="0043">Next, a dispersant for a pigment in an ink, an
important feature of the present invention, will be
set forth.</p><p num="0044">Examples of dispersants to be used include, for
example, a water-soluble resin which is generally
used as a pigment dispersant for an ink for ink jet
and which contains hydrophilic and hydrophobic
portions. Examples of water-soluble resins include a
block copolymer and a random copolymer prepared from
at least one hydrophilic monomer and at least one
hydrophobic monomer and salts thereof. Example of the
hydrophilic monomer include aliphatic alcoholic esters
of α, β-ethylene unsaturated carboxylic acids, acrylic
acid, acrylic acid derivatives, maleic acid, maleic
acid derivatives, itaconic acid, itaconic acid
derivatives, fumaric acid, fumaric acid derivatives,
etc. Examples of the hydrophobic monomer include
styrene, styrene derivatives, vinylnaphthalene
derivatives.</p><p num="0045">Polymers include block polymers and random
polymers, branched polymers, and graft polymers. Of
them, dispersants are particularly preferably block
polymers. In other words, thermal ink jet recording 
includes a step of heating an ink using a heater, and
so a water-soluble resin to be contained in an ink is
preferably a resin that does not or rarely form koga
or the like on the heater. For this reason, block
polymers are particularly suited for this purpose.</p><p num="0046">The structures of block polymers include AB,
BAB and ABC types (A, B, C schematically indicate
polymer blocks whose structures are different to each
other) and the structure is not particularly limited
if block portions are present. In particular,
preferably, the block polymer has hydrophobic and
hydrophilic blocks as well as a balanced block size
that contributes to dispersion stability, because
functional groups can be introduced into the
hydrophobic blocks to which the coloring material
binds to enhance specific interaction between the
dispersant and the coloring material for improved
dispersion stability. Further, the polymer is
rheologically more preferable when used in a method
of utilizing thermal energy, particularly with a head
corresponding to small droplet discharge.</p><p num="0047">The amount of a polymer depends on the
structure of a polymer to be used, the molecular
weight and other properties, and also components of
the ink composition.</p><p num="0048">When the number average molecular weight of a
polymer used in the present invention is 2000 or 
larger and less than 40000, preferably 2000 or larger
and less than 20000, and particularly preferably 2000
or larger and less than 10000, even when a head using
thermal energy is particularly employed, dispersion
stability can be ensured without deteriorating the
response at a high frequency.</p><p num="0049">In addition, methods of manufacturing these

is driven at a high frequency, the use of these block
polymers for inks of the present invention improves
discharge properties more conspicuously.</p><p num="0056">In addition, a head by means of thermal energy
gives further discharge continuity, and so a nonionic

include polyoxyethylenealkyl ether,

fatty ester, sorbitan fatty ester, polyoxyethylene
sorbitan fatty ester and ethylene oxide adducts of
acetylene glycol. The HLB is preferably 10 or more,

or more, and still more preferably 0.8% by weight or
more, to sufficiently obtain the effect of discharge
continuity. Furthermore, when the viscosity of the 
ink is taken into account, the amount of surfactants
is preferably 3% by weight or less with respect to

invention. These contents are preferably 1% by
weight or more relative to the total weight of ink, 
and are preferably 20% by weight or less.</p><heading>(Ink set)</heading><p num="0063">Now, an ink set relating to the present
invention will be set forth.</p><p num="0064">An ink set of the present invention comprises a
first ink and a second ink, where the first ink is
the above-mentioned light ink according to the
present invention. The second ink forms an image of
the same or substantially the same color hue as the
first ink forms but has a higher coloring power than
the first ink. In the present invention, the second
(dark) ink and the first (light) ink are defined to
give images of the same hue. Here, the same color
hue image means that when images of 360 dpi (dot per
inch) × 720 dpi on plain paper are formed with the
dark ink and the light ink respectively using an ink
jet recording head that ejects 20 to 50 pl droplets,
and thus obtained images are visually observed and
are classified into 10 Munsell categories (R, YR, Y,
GY, G, BG, B, PB, P and RP) based on the Munsell
color chart, and the images belong to the same
category or adjacent categories.</p><p num="0065">Additionally, a higher coloring ability means
that, for example, the content of a coloring material
is larger than that of the first ink, that is to say,
that the content of the coloring material is larger
than 1% with respect to the total amount of ink. 
Moreover, the kinds of coloring materials are not
necessarily the same between the first ink and the
second ink.</p><p num="0066">The first ink, i.e. a light ink, has already
been described.</p><p num="0067">With the second ink, i.e. a dark ink, suitable
components and composition such as pigment, resinous
dispersant and an aqueous medium are the same as
those described for the light ink, except for pigment
concentration and the ratio of the dispersant to the
pigment.</p><p num="0068">The ratio of a resinous dispersant to a pigment
in a dark ink is preferably smaller than the ratio of
a dispersant to a pigment in a light ink. The weight
ratio of a dispersant to a pigment (dispersant/pigment)
is not particularly limited, but for long-term
storage stability of an ink, the ratio is
preferably 1/10 or more, more preferably 1/8 or more,
and still more preferably 1/6 or more. In addition,
for low viscosity and excellent discharge properties
of the ink, the ratio is preferably 1 or less, more
preferably 4/5 or less, and still more preferably 2/3
or less.</p><p num="0069">In addition, in an ink set of the present
invention, although different pigments can be used
for a dark ink and a light ink, preferably, the same
pigment is used and only its amount in inks is 
changed.</p><p num="0070">To express a color gradation with a light ink
and a dark ink using the same pigment, the pigment
content of the dark ink is preferably 1.5% by weight
or more for a sufficient image concentration.
Pigment content of 6% by weight or less is preferable
since the solid matter in the ink is not so high that
clogging hardly occurs.</p><heading>Ink jet recording apparatus, recording unit, etc.</heading><p num="0071">A preferable apparatus, as an ink-jet recording
apparatus to carry out recording by use of an ink of
the present invention, is such that gives thermal
energy to the ink in a recording head corresponding
to recording signals, and generates liquid droplets
by thermal energy.</p><p num="0072">Examples of the construction of a head, which
is a main component of such an apparatus, are
illustrated in FIGS.. 1, 2 and 3. Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional
view of a head 13 taken along the flow path
of ink, and Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken
along line 2-2 in Fig. 1. The head 13 is formed by
bonding a glass, ceramic, silicon or plastic plate or
the like having a groove 14 through which an ink is
passed, to a heating head 15 for thermal recording
(not limited to such a thin-film head as illustrated
by the drawings). The heating head 15 is composed of
a protective film 16 made of silicon oxide or the 
like, aluminum electrodes 17-1 and 17-2, a heating
resistor layer 18 made of nichrome or the like, a
heat accumulating layer 19, and a substrate 20 made
of alumina or the like having a good heat radiating
properties.</p><p num="0073">An ink 21 comes up to an ejection orifice (a
minute opening) 22 and forms a meniscus 23 due to a
pressure P. Now, upon application of electric
signals to the aluminum electrodes 17-1 and 17-2, the
heating head 15 rapidly generates heat at the region
shown by "n" to form bubbles in the ink 21 which is
in contact with this region. The meniscus 23 of the
ink is projected by the pressure thus produced, and
the ink 21 is ejected in the form of ink droplets 24
from the ejection orifice 22 toward a recording
medium 25.</p><p num="0074">Fig. 3 illustrates an appearance of a multi-head
composed of an array of a number of heads as
shown in Fig. 1. The multi-head is formed by closely
bonding a glass plate 27 having a number of grooves
26 to a heating head 28 similar to that described in
Fig. 1.</p><p num="0075">Fig. 4 illustrates an example of an ink-jet
recording apparatus in which such a head as described
above has been incorporated. In Fig. 4, reference
numeral 61 designates a blade serving as a wiping
member, one end of which is a stationary end held by 
a blade-holding member to form a cantilever. The
blade 61 is provided at a position adjacent to a
region in which a recording head 65 operates, and in
this embodiment, is held in such a form that it
protrudes into the course through which the recording
head 65 is moved. Reference numeral 62 indicates a
cap for the face of ejection openings of the
recording head 65, which is provided at a home
position adjacent to the blade 61, and is so
constructed that it moves in the direction
perpendicular to a direction in which the recording
head 65 is moved, and comes into contact with the
face of ejection openings to cap it. Reference
numeral 63 denotes an ink absorbing member provided
adjoiningly to the blade 61 and, similarly to the
blade 61, held in such a form that it protrudes into
the course through which the recording head 65 is
moved.</p><p num="0076">The above-described blade 61, cap 62 and ink
absorbing member 63 constitute an ejection-recovery
portion 64, where the blade 61 and the ink absorbing
member 63 remove water, dust and/or the like from the
face of the ink-ejecting openings. Reference numeral
65 designates the recording head having an ejection-energy-generating
means and serving to eject ink onto
a recording medium set in an opposing relation to the
ejection opening face provided with the ejection 
openings to conduct recording. Reference numeral 66
indicates a carriage on which the recording head 65
is mounted so that the recording head 65 can be moved
The carriage 66 is slidably interlocked with a guide
shaft 67 and is connected (not illustrated) at its
part to a belt 69 driven by a motor 68. Thus, the
carriage 66 can be moved along the guide shaft 67 and
hence, the recording head 65 can be moved from a
recording region to a region adjacent thereto.</p><p num="0077">Reference numerals 51 and 52 denote a feeding
part from which the recording medium is inserted, and
feed rollers driven by a motor (not illustrated),
respectively. By this construction, the recording
medium is fed to the position opposing to the
ejection opening face of the recording head 65 and
delivered to the delivery portion provided with the
delivery roller 53 as recording progresses.</p><p num="0078">In the above construction, the cap 62 in the
ejection-recovery portion 64 is receded from the path
of motion of the recording head 65 when the recording
head 65 is returned to its home position after
completion of recording, and the blade 61 remains
protruded into the path of motion. As a result, the
ejection opening face of the recording head 65 is
wiped. When the cap 62 comes into contact with the
ejection opening face of the recording head 65 to cap
it, the cap 62 is moved so as to protrude into the 
path of motion of the recording head 65.</p><p num="0079">When the recording head 65 is moved from its
home position to the position at which recording is
started, the cap 62 and the blade 61 are at the same
positions as the positions for the wiping as
described above. As a result, the ejection opening
face of the recording head 65 is also wiped at the
time of this movement. The above movement of the
recording head 65 to its home position is made not
only when the recording is completed or the recording
head 65 is recovered for ejection, but also during
the period when the recording head 65 is moved
between recording regions for the purpose of
recording, where it is moved to the home position
adjacent to each recording region at given intervals,
whereby the ejection opening face is wiped in
accordance with this movement.</p><p num="0080">Fig. 5 illustrates an exemplary ink cartridge
45 in which an ink to be fed to a head through a
member for feeding the ink, for example, a tube is
contained. Here, reference numeral 40 designates an
ink container containing the ink to be fed, as
exemplified by a bag for ink. One end thereof is
provided with a stopper 42 made of rubber. A needle
(not illustrated) may be inserted into this stopper
42 so that the ink in the bag 40 for ink can be fed
to the head. Reference numeral 44 indicates an ink 
absorbing member for receiving a waste ink. The ink
container in the present invention is formed from a
compound selected from the group consisting of
polyadetates and polyolefines. It is preferred that
the ink container 40 be formed of a polyolefin, in
particular, polypropylene, at its surface with which
the ink comes into contact.</p><p num="0081">The ink-jet recording apparatus according to
the present invention are not limited to the
apparatus as described above in which the head and
the ink cartridge are separately provided. Therefore,
a device in which these members are integrally formed
as shown in Fig. 6 can also be preferably used. In
Fig. 6, reference numeral 70 designates a recording
unit, in the interior of which an ink container
containing an ink, for example, an ink-holding member,
is contained. The recording unit 70 is so
constructed that the ink in such an ink-holding
member is ejected in the form of ink droplets through
a head portion 71 having a plurality of orifices.</p><p num="0082">While polymers of inorganic compounds,
polyvinyl acetate, polyolefins or the like are
commonly used as a material for the ink-holding
member, but as mentioned above, in the present
invention, the ink-holding member is made of those
compounds selected from the group including polyvinyl
acetate and polyolefins. Further, while an ink-holding 
member made of a porous material or having a
multi-layer structure is preferably used, it is
particularly preferred to use compressed fiber
aggregate from the viewpoints of the ink holding
properties, ink ejecting properties, and reliability.
It is preferred to use an ink-holding member having a
multi-layer structure or fiber aggregate of which
multi-layer arrangement or the fiber arrangement in
the ink container is aligned in an ink discharging
direction. It is also preferred an ink-holding
member having a contact surface with the ink
container. Reference numeral 72 indicates an air
passage for communicating the interior of the
recording unit 70 with the atmosphere. This
recording unit 70 is used in place of the recording
head 65 shown in Fig. 4, and is detachably installed
on the carriage 66.</p><p num="0083">Other specific examples of the recording

included as an another example.</p><p num="0089">Fig. 8 illustrates an exemplary ink-jet
cartridge capable of being mounted on the above-described
ink-jet recording apparatus. The cartridge
1012 in this embodiment is of a serial type, and its
principal part is constructed by an ink-jet recording
head 100 and a liquid tank 1001 for containing a
liquid such as an ink.</p><p num="0090">In the ink-jet recording head 100, a large

liquid are formed, and the liquid such as an ink is 
directed to a common liquid chamber (see Fig. 9) in
the liquid-ejecting head 100 through a liquid feed
passage (not illustrated) from the liquid tank 1001.
The cartridge 1012 shown in Fig. 8 is so constructed
that the ink-jet recording head 100 and the liquid
tank 1001 are integrally formed, and the liquid can
be supplied to the interior of the liquid tank 1001
as needed. However, a structure that the liquid tank

embodiment, such a substrate 934 composed of glass,
ceramic, plastic or metal as illustrated in, for
example, Fig. 9 is used. The material of such a 
substrate is not essential to the present invention
and is not particularly limited so far as it
functions as a part of a flow-path forming member and
as a support for an ink ejection-energy-generating
element, and a material layer for forming a liquid
flow path and ejection openings, which will be
described subsequently. Therefore, in this
embodiment, the description is given in the case
where an Si substrate (wafer) is used. The ejection
openings can be formed on such a substrate 934.
Processes therefor include a forming process by laser
beam, and a process in which for example, a
photosensitive resin is used as an orifice plate
(ejection-opening plate) 935, which will be described
subsequently, to form ejection openings by an
exposure apparatus such as MPA (mirror projection
aligner).</p><p num="0094">In Fig. 9, reference numeral 934 indicates a
substrate equipped with electrothermal conversion
elements (hereinafter may be referred to as "heater"
in some cases) 931 and an ink feed opening 933 formed
of a long-grooved through-opening as a common liquid
chamber. The heaters 931, which are thermal energy-generating
means, are arranged in a zigzag form in a
row on both sides of the ink feed opening 933 along
the longitudinal direction thereof with an interval
of, for example, 300 dpi between the electrothermal 
conversion elements. Walls 936 for ink flow path for
forming ink flow paths are provided on the substrate
934. Further, an ejection-opening plate 935 equipped
with ejection openings 832 is provided on the walls
936 for ink flow path.</p><p num="0095">In Fig. 9, the walls 936 for ink flow path and
the ejection-opening plate 935 are illustrated as
separate members. However, the walls 936 for ink
flow path may be formed on the substrate 934 by a
method such as spin coating, thereby forming the
walls 936 for ink flow path and the ejection-opening
plate 935 as the same member at the same time. In
this embodiment, the side of the ejection-opening
face (upper surface) 935a is subjected to a water-repellent
treatment.</p><p num="0096">In the apparatus illustrated, a head of the
serial type that recording is conducted with scanning
in the direction shown by the arrow S in Fig. 7 is
used to conduct recording at, for example, 1,200 dpi.
Driving frequency is 10 kHz, and ejection is
conducted at the shortest time interval of 100 µs in
one ejection opening.</p><p num="0097">As an example of dimensions of the head, a
partition wall 936a for isolating adjacent nozzles
from each other from the viewpoint of fluid has a
width w of 14 µm as illustrated in, for example, Fig.
10. As illustrated in Fig. 13, a bubbling chamber 
1337 formed with the walls 936 for ink flow path has
N1 (width of the bubbling chamber) of 33 µm and N2
(length of the bubbling chamber) of 35 µm. The size
of the heater 931 is 30 µm × 30 µm, the resistance
value of the heater is 53Ω, and the driving voltage
is 10.3 V. A head in which the heights of the wall
936 for ink flow path and the partition wall 936a are
12 µm, and the thickness of the ejection-opening
plate is 11 µm may be used.</p><p num="0098">In the section of an ejection opening part 940
provided in the ejection-opening plate including
ejection openings 832, the form of a section taken
along a direction intersecting the ejecting direction
(thickness-wise direction of the orifice plate 935)
of the ink is a substantially star form as
illustrated in Fig. 11 and is generally formed from 6
projected portions 832a having a corner of an obtuse
angle and 6 recessed portions 832b alternately
arranged between these projected portions 832a and
having a corner of an acute angle. More specifically,
6 grooves (with respect to the position of the groove
portion, see 1141a in Fig. 14) are formed in the
thickness-wise direction (ejecting direction of the
liquid) of the orifice plate shown in Fig. 9 by
forming the recessed portions 832b locally distant
from the center O of the ejection opening as a top
thereof and the projected portions 832a adjacent to 
the recessed portions 832b and locally near from the
center O of the ejection opening as a base.</p><p num="0099">In the liquid-ejecting head illustrated, the
ejection opening part 940 is such that, for example,
a section taken along a direction intersecting the
thickness-wise direction thereof is in a form with 2
equilateral triangles having a side of 27 µm combined
with each other in a state that one of them has been
turned by 60 degrees relative to the other. T1 shown
in Fig. 17 is 8 µm. The angles of the projected
portions 832a are all 120 degrees, while the angles
of the recessed portions 832b are all 60 degrees.</p><p num="0100">Accordingly, the center O of the ejection
opening coincides with the center of gravity G of the
polygon formed by connecting the centers (the center
(center of gravity) of each figure formed by
connecting the top of the groove and the 2 bases
adjacent to the top) of the grooves adjacent to each
other (see Fig. 11). The opening area of the
ejection opening 832 in this embodiment is 400 µm<sup>2</sup>,
and the opening area of each groove (the area of each
figure formed by connecting the top of the groove and
the 2 bases adjacent to the top) is about 33 µm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p num="0101">Fig. 12 is a typical drawing illustrating a
state that an ink has adhered to the ejection opening

recording head of the above-described
construction will hereinafter be described with
reference to FIGS. 14 to 21.</p><p num="0103">FIGS. 14 to 21 are cross-sectional views for

1337 shown in FIG.. 13 taken along line 14-14. In
this section, an end of the ejection opening part 940

bubble has been formed on the heater, and FIGS. 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 illustrate states after
about 1 µs, about 2 µs, about 3 µs, about 4 µs, about
5 µs, about 6 µs and about 7 µs from the state in FIG.
14, respectively. Incidentally, in the following
description, "drop" or "drop-in" does not mean drop
in the so-called gravity direction, but means the
movement in the direction of an electrothermal
conversion element irrespective of the installing
direction of a head.</p><p num="0105">When a bubble 101 is first formed in a liquid
flow path 1338 on a heater 931 by energizing the
heater 931 on the basis of a recording signal or the
like as illustrated in FIG. 14, the bubble quickly
volumetrically expands and grows during about 2 µs as 
illustrated in FIGS. 15 and 16. The height of the
bubble 101 in the greatest volume exceeds the face
935a of an ejection opening. At this time, the
pressure of the bubble decreases from one to several
to one to several tens as high as the atmospheric
pressure.</p><p num="0106">At the time about 2 µs have elapsed from the
formation of the bubble, the volume of the bubble 101
turns from the greatest volume to decreased volume as
described above, and at substantially the same time
as this, the formation of a meniscus 1004 is started.
The meniscus 1004 also recedes, i.e., drops in the
direction of the heater 931 as illustrated in FIG. 17.</p><p num="0107">In this embodiment, the ejection opening part
in the liquid-ejecting head illustrated has a
plurality of grooves 1141 in a dispersed state,
whereby capillary force acts in an opposite direction
FC to the receding direction FM of the meniscus at
the portion of the groove 1141 when the meniscus 1004
recedes. As a result, the forms of the meniscus and
a main droplet (hereinafter may be referred to as
"liquid" or "ink" in some cases) Ia when the meniscus
recedes are compensated so as to give substantially
symmetrical forms to the center of the ejection
opening even if some variation is observed in the
state of the bubble 101 by some cause.</p><p num="0108">In the liquid-ejecting head illustrated, the 
dropping velocity of this meniscus 1004 is faster
than the contracting velocity of the bubble 101, so
that the bubble 101 communicates with the atmosphere
in the vicinity of the lower surface of the ejection
opening 832 at the time about 4 µs have elapsed from
the formation of the bubble as illustrated in FIG. 18.
At this time, the liquid (ink) in the vicinity of the
central axis of the ejection opening 832 drops toward
the heater 931 because the liquid (ink) Ia pulled
back on the side of the heater 931 by the negative
pressure of the bubble 101 before the communication
with the atmosphere retains the velocity in the
direction toward the heater 931 by virtue of inertia
even after the communication with the atmosphere.</p><p num="0109">The liquid (ink) dropped toward the side of the
heater 931 reaches the surface of the heater 931 at
the time about 5 µs have elapsed from the formation
of the bubble 101 as illustrated in FIG. 19, and
spreads so as to cover the surface of the heater 931
as illustrated in FIG. 20. The liquid spread so as
to cover the surface of the heater 931 as described
above has a vector in a horizontal direction along
the surface of the heater 931. However, a vector in
a direction intersecting the surface of the heater
931, for example, perpendicular direction vanishes,
so that the liquid intends to remain on the surface
of the heater 931, thereby pulling a liquid located 
above such a liquid, i.e., a liquid keeping a
velocity vector in the ejecting direction, downward.</p><p num="0110">Thereafter, a liquid portion Ib between the
liquid spread on the surface of the heater 931 and
the liquid located thereabove (main droplet) becomes
thin, and is broken in the center of the surface of
the heater 931 at the time about 7 µs have elapsed
from the formation of the bubble as illustrated in
FIG. 21, whereby the liquid is separated into a main
droplet Ia keeping a velocity vector in the ejecting
direction and a liquid Ic spread on the surface of
the heater 931. The position of such separation is
desirably the interior of the liquid flow path 1338,
preferably a side closer to the electrothermal
conversion element 931 than the ejection opening 832.</p><p num="0111">The main droplet Ia is ejected from the central
portion of the ejection opening 832 without deviation
in the ejecting direction and ejection slippage and
impacted at the prescribed position of a recording
surface on a recording medium. The liquid Ic spread
on the surface of the heater 931 is ejected as a
satellite droplet following the main droplet up to
now. However, it remains on the surface of the
heater 931 without being ejected.</p><p num="0112">Since the ejection of the satellite droplet can
be prevented as described above, splash easily
occurring by the ejection of the satellite droplet 
can be prevented, and staining of the recording
surface on the recording medium with mist suspending
in the form of fog can be surely prevented. In FIGS.
18 to 21, reference characters Id and Ie indicate an
ink attached to the groove portion (ink within the
groove) and an ink remaining in the liquid flow path,
respectively.</p><p num="0113">As described above, in the liquid-ejecting head
illustrated, the direction of the main droplet upon
ejection can be stabilized by the plural grooves
dispersed relative to the center of the ejection
opening when the liquid is ejected at the stage that
the volume of the bubble decreases after growing into
the greatest volume. As a result, a liquid-ejecting
head free of slippage in the ejecting direction and
high in impact accuracy can be provided. In addition,
ejection can be stably conducted against the
variation of bubbling at high driving frequency,
whereby high-speed and high-definition printing can
be realized.</p><p num="0114">In particular, in the liquid-ejecting head
illustrated, the liquid is ejected by communicating
the bubble with the atmosphere for the first time at
the stage that the volume of the bubble decreases,
whereby mist occurring upon the ejection of the
droplet by communicating the bubble with the
atmosphere can be prevented, so that the state that 
droplets adhere to the ejection opening face, which
forms the main cause of the so-called sudden ejection
failure, can also be inhibited.</p><p num="0115">As another embodiment of the recording head of
the ejection system that a bubble is communicated
with the atmosphere upon ejection, there may be
mentioned the so-called edge shooter type as
described in, for example, Japanese Patent
Registration No. 2783647.</p><p num="0116">In particular, the present invention has
excellent effects in recording heads and recording
apparatus of an ink-jet system that thermal energy is
utilized to form a flying droplet to be ejected,
thereby conducting recording, among the ink-jet
recording systems.</p><p num="0117">With respect to the typical construction and
principle thereof, those using the basic principle
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,723,129
and 4,740,796 are preferred.</p><p num="0118">This system may be applied to any of the so-called
On-Demand type and continuous type. In
particular, the On-Demand type is effective because
at least one driving signal which corresponds to
recording information and gives a rapid temperature
rise exceeding film boiling is applied to an
electrothermal converter arranged corresponding to a
sheet or liquid path, in which a liquid (ink) is held, 
thereby causing the electrothermal converter to
generate thermal energy to cause film boiling on the
heat-acting surface of a recording head, so that a
bubble can be formed in the liquid (ink) in response
to the driving signal in relation of one to one. The
liquid (ink) is ejected through an ejection opening
by the growth-contraction of this bubble to form at
least one droplet. When the driving signal is
applied in the form of a pulse, the growth-contraction
of the bubble is suitably conducted in a
moment, so that the ejection of the liquid (ink)
excellent in responsiveness in particular can be
achieved. It is therefore preferable to use such
pulsed signals.</p><p num="0119">As the pulsed driving signal, such signals as
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,463,359 and 4,345,262
are suitable. When the conditions described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,313,124 that is an invention relating to
the rate of temperature rise f the heat-acting
surface are adopted, far excellent recording can be
conducted.</p><p num="0120">As the construction of the recording head which
makes up the ink-jet recording apparatus to be used
in the present invention, such combined constructions
(linear liquid flow path or perpendicular liquid flow
path) of ejection openings, a liquid flow path and
electrothermal converters as disclosed in the above-described 
U.S. specifications, and besides
constructions based on U.S. Patent Nos. 4,558,333 and
4,459,600 which disclose the construction that a
heat-acting portion is arranged in a curved region
may also be preferably used.</p><p num="0121">In addition, constructions based on Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 59-123670 which
discloses the construction that a slit common to a
plurality of electrothermal converters are used as an
ejection part of the electrothermal converters, and
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 59-138461
which discloses the construction that an opening
absorbing pressure wave of thermal energy is provided
in opposition to an ejection part may also be
effective for the present invention.</p><p num="0122">Further, as a full-line type recording head
having a length corresponding to the longest width of
recording media, on which a recording apparatus can
record, both construction that the length is met by
such a combination of plural recording heads as
disclosed in the above-described specifications and
construction as one recording head integrally formed
may be used, and the above-described effects of the
present invention can be more effectively exhibited.</p><p num="0123">In addition, the present invention is effective
even when a replaceable, chip type recording head in
which electrical connection to an apparatus body and 
the feed of an ink from the apparatus body become
feasible by installing in the apparatus body, or a
cartridge type recording head in which an ink tank is
provided integrally in a recording head itself is
used.</p><p num="0124">Further, the addition of recovery means for a
recording head, preliminary auxiliary means, etc.
which are provided to the constitution of the
recording apparatus to be used for the present
invention is preferred because the effects of the
present invention can be more stabilized.
Specifically, capping means for the recording head,
cleaning means, pressurizing or sucking means,
preliminary heating means by electrothermal
converters, other heating elements than these or
combinations thereof, and preliminary ejection mode
that ejection separate from recording is conducted
may also be effective for stable recording.</p><p num="0125">As a recording mode of the recording apparatus,
the present invention is extremely effective for not
only recording mode using main colors such as black,
but also apparatus equipped with at least one of
complex color of different colors and full color by
color mixing by integrally constructing a recording
head or combining plural recording heads with each
other.</p><p num="0126">In the above-described embodiments of the 
present invention, the inks have been described as
liquid. However, inks solidified at room temperature
or lower may also be used so far as they are softened
or liquid at room temperature, or exhibit a liquid
phase upon application of recording signals used
because it is general in the above-described ink-jet
systems that the temperature control of an ink itself
is conducted within a range of from 30 to 70°C to
adjust the viscosity of the ink so as to fall within
a stable ejection range.</p><p num="0127">In addition, inks that are liquefied by
applying thermal energy according to recording
signals and ejected as liquid inks, such as inks
that temperature rise by thermal energy is positively
prevented by using the thermal energy as energy for
phase change from a solid phase to a liquid phase and
inks solidified in a state left to stand for the
purpose of preventing evaporation of the inks, and
inks of a nature that they are liquefied for the
first time by thermal energy, such as those already
beginning to solidify at the time they reach a
recording medium, may also be applied to the present
invention. In such a case, the inks may be in a form
that they are opposed to electrothermal converters in
a state retained as a liquid or solid in recesses or
through-holes in a porous sheet as described in
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 54-56847 or 
60-71260. In the present invention, the above-described
film boiling system is most effective for
the above-described inks.</p><p num="0128">Furthermore, as forms of the recording
apparatus according to the present invention, forms
that the apparatus is integrally or separately
provided as an image output terminal for information
processing instruments such as word processors and

combined with a reader and facsimiles having a
transmitting-receiving function may also be adopted.</p><p num="0129">The outline of a liquid-ejecting apparatus in
