More especially it relates to processes in which synthesis mixtures are seeded to control process conditions and product characteristics, to compositions for providing seeds in such processes, and to methods of obtaining such compositions. It is well known that seeding a molecular sieve synthesis mixture frequently has beneficial effects, for example in controlling the particle size of the product, avoiding the need for an organic template, accelerating synthesis, and improving the proportion of product that is of the intended structure type.</p><p num="p0003">Colloidal seeds have proved especially effective, as described in International Application No. WO 97/03019, 03020, and 03021, and EP-A-753 483, 753 484, and 753 485. Whereas procedures for the preparation of colloidal dispersions of certain structure types have been described in the above-mentioned references, and similar procedures are effective in the preparation of colloidal dispersions of crystalline molecular sieves of other structure types, these procedures have proved ineffective in the preparation of colloidal dispersions of certain further structure types, especially LEV.</p><p num="p0004">As used in this specification, the term "structure type" is used in the sense described in the Structure Type Atlas, Zeolites 17, 1996. It has now been found that colloidal LEV may be produced by a completely different method, and that a colloidal LEV structure type crystalline molecular sieve, especially in the form of a colloidal dispersion, has valuable properties in seeding the manufacture of crystalline molecular sieves. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 The present invention provides, in a first aspect, a colloidal suspension of a LEV structure type crystalline molecular sieve.</p><p num="p0005">The present invention also provides a method for preparing a colloidal suspension of LEV by synthesizing a LEV structure type crystalline molecular sieve by treatment of an appropriate synthesis mixture, separating the product from the synthesis mixture, washing the product, and recovering the resulting wash liquid. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the LEV produced by a conventional LEV synthesis comprises LEV particles of greater size, normally in excess of lμm, intermixed with particles of colloidal size, which are separable from the larger particles by conventional water-washing processes. It has been observed that while the first wash water may sometimes be clear, and may contain no or very few colloidal particles, the second or subsequent wash water is not clear, and has a measurable solids content. The resulting wash waters are colloidal suspensions or dispersions of LEV crystallites, which have considerable utility as sources of seeds in crystalline molecular sieve manufacture. (If desired, the dispersions may be made more concentrated before use . )</p><p num="p0006">The colloidal LEV seeds of the invention and produced by a method according to the invention are especially suitable for use in syntheses to produce crystalline molecular sieves of the LEV, FER, MOR, ERI/OFF, MAZ, OFF, ZSM-57, and CHA structure types . Examples of CHA materials are Chabasite and the phosphorus-containing molecular sieves SAPO-, A1PO-, MeAPO-, MeAPSO- , E1APSO- and E1APO -37 and especially the corresponding -34 materials. In these formulae, El represents magnesium, zinc, iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, chromium or mixtures of any two or more such elements . Examples of MAZ materials include mazzite, zeolite omega, and ZSM-4. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
Colloidal LEV structure type seeds may also be used in the synthesis of phosphorus-containing crystalline molecular sieves, e.g., SAPO-, A1PO- , MeAPO-, MeAPSO-, ElAPSO- and ElAPO- materials, of the LEV structure type, e.g., the -35 materials. (Where a material is referred to as, for example, a SAPO material, this terminology includes the possibility that additional elements may be present, either in the framework or otherwise) . LEV structure type zeolites may also be prepared using the colloidal seeds of the invention, for example Levyne, ZK-20, NU-3 and ZSM-45.</p><p num="p0007">As used herein, the term "colloidal", when used of a suspension, refers to one containing discrete finely divided particles dispersed in a continuous liquid phase and preferably refers to a suspension that is stable, in the sense that no visible separation occurs or sediment forms, in a period sufficient for the use intended, advantageously for at least 10, more advantageously at least 20, preferably at least 100, and more preferably at least 500, hours at ambient temperature (23°C) . The maximum size of the particles for the suspension to remain stable (peptized) will depend to some extent on their shape, and on the nature and pH of the continuous medium, as well as on the period during which the suspension must remain usable. In general, the maximum dimension will be lμm, advantageously 500, more advantageously 400, preferably 300, more preferably 200, and most preferably 100, nm. The particles may be spherical, or of other shapes. Where particles are other than spherical, the dimension referred to is their smallest dimension.</p><p num="p0008">The minimum dimension is such that the particles do not dissolve or re-dissolve in the medium, and for crystallinity they must contain at least a small plurality, advantageously at least two, preferably four, unit cells of the crystal. The minimum particle size is in general 5, advantageously 10, and preferably 20, nm. Mean particle sizes are generally in 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
the range 5 to 1000, advantageously 10 to 300, more advantageously 10 to 200, and preferably 20 to 100, nm. Advantageously at least 50%, more advantageously at least 80%, and more preferably at least 95%, by number, of the particles are greater than the given minima, smaller than the given maxima, or within the given ranges of particle size. Measurements of particle size may be effected by electron microscopy, for example using a Philips SEM 515 unit.</p><p num="p0009">As indicated above, the colloidal seeds of the invention have utility in the manufacture of a variety of crystalline molecular sieves by incorporating the seeds as a component of a synthesis mixture. They are advantageously incorporated in the synthesis mixture in the form of a suspension, advantageously in an aqueous medium, preferably water, or another liquid component of the synthesis mixture. Less preferably they may be added in dry, but not calcined, form. It is believed that calcination significantly reduces the activity of small crystallites to act as seeds; similarly any other treatment that reduces the seeding activity of materials should be avoided.</p><p num="p0010">The colloidal seeds are generally present in the synthesis mixture in a concentration of up to 10000, advantageously at most 3000, more advantageously at most 1500, and preferably at most 1000, more preferably at most 500, and most preferably at most 350 ppm, based on the total weight of the synthesis mixture. A minimum seeding level is generally 1 ppb (0.001 ppm), advantageously at least 0.1, more advantageously at least 1, and preferably at least 10, ppm, based on the total weight of the synthesis mixture. Advantageous ranges of proportions are from 1 to 2000, preferably 100 to 1500, and most preferably 100 to 250, ppm.</p><p num="p0011">Apart from the presence of the seeds, the synthesis mixture used is typically one that is known in the art or as described in the literature as suitable for the production of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
the molecular sieve concerned. This is also the case for the conditions of treatment, except that the presence of the seeds may make possible the reduction of reaction times or may obviate stirring if that were otherwise necessary. In general, the treatment of the synthesis mixture to yield the desired crystalline molecular sieve, usually termed hydrothermal treatment, though strictly that term should be used only for treatments in which there is vapour-phase water present, is advantageously carried out under autogenous pressure, for example in an autoclave, for example a stainless steel autoclave which may, if desired, be ptfe- lined. The treatment may, for example, be carried out at a temperature within the range of from 50, advantageously from 90, especially 120, to 250°C, depending on the molecular sieve being made. The treatment may, for example, be carried out for a period within the range of from 20 to 200 hours, preferably up to 100 hours, again depending on the molecular sieve being formed. The procedure may include an ageing period, either at room temperature or, preferably, at a moderately elevated temperature, before the hydrothermal treatment at more elevated temperature. The latter may include a period of gradual or stepwise variation in temperature .</p><p num="p0012">For certain applications, the treatment is carried out with stirring or with rotating the vessel about a horizontal axis (tumbling) . For other applications, static hydrothermal treatment is preferred. If desired, the synthesis mixture may be stirred or tumbled during an initial part of the heating stage, for example, from room temperature to an elevated, e.g., the final treatment, temperature, and be static for the remainder. Agitation generally produces a product with a smaller particle size and a narrower particle size distribution than static hydrothermal treatment. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 If the product is desired in small particle size form, a larger number of smaller sized LEV seeds is desirably employed. The smaller the mean particle size of the seeds, the lower the weight percentage that is effective. The crystals are advantageously stirred into the synthesis mixture for a time sufficient to provide a uniform dispersion, this time being dependent primarily on the viscosity of the synthesis mixture, and also the scale and type of equipment, but ranging generally from 30 seconds to 10 minutes.</p><p num="p0013">The present invention accordingly provides in a second aspect a process for the manufacture of a crystalline molecular sieve, which process comprises treating a synthesis mixture comprising elements necessary to form the molecular sieve and colloidal LEV crystalline molecular sieve seeds for a time and at a temperature appropriate to form the desired molecular sieve.</p><p num="p0014">As mentioned above, the LEV seed crystals may be used in the manufacture of a molecular sieve of a structure type other than LEV. Such seeding may be regarded as</p><p num="p0015">"heterostructural" , whereas seeding with seeds of the same structure type is termed "isostructural" , whether or not the seeds are of the same composition (i.e., contain the same elements in the same proportions) as the crystalline molecular sieve to be produced.</p><p num="p0016">The present invention accordingly provides in a third aspect a process for the manufacture of a crystalline molecular sieve, which comprises treating a synthesis mixture comprising elements necessary to form a molecular sieve of a first structure type, other than LEV, and colloidal LEV molecular sieve seed crystals for a time sufficient and at a temperature appropriate to form the molecular sieve of the first structure type. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 In some embodiments of this aspect, the structure types of the desired molecular sieves are topologically similar to LEV, i.e., are members of the ABC-6 group of materials, as described in Topochemistry of Zeolites and Related Materials, J.V. Smith, Chem. Rev. 1988, 88, 149 at 167, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The ABC-6 group includes, inter alia, the Offretite and Chabazite, as well as the Levyne, structures. In other embodiments, topologically dissimilar structure types, e.g., MOR, FER, MAZ, EUO, and MFS, are produced.</p><p num="p0017">In further aspects, the invention provides the use, in the synthesis of a crystalline molecular sieve, of colloidal LEV seed crystals to avoid the need for an organic template, to produce different morphologies, or to control the morphology, of the product, to control the purity, particle size or particle size distribution of the product, or to accelerate the formation of the product, or to achieve two or more such effects.</p><p num="p0018">Also as indicated above, colloidal LEV seeds are especially suitable in the manufacture of phosphorus- containing molecular sieves, more especially aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates . They are also especially useful in the manufacture of a colloidal suspension of a crystalline molecular sieve of another structure type, especially CHA.</p><p num="p0019">The invention also provides the products of the processes and of the uses of the earlier aspects of the invention. The products, if required after cation exchange and/or calcining, have utility as catalyst precursors, catalysts, and separation and absorption media. They are especially useful in numerous hydrocarbon conversions, separations and absorptions.

Hydrocarbon conversions include, for example, cracking, reforming, hydrofining, aromatization, oligomerisation, isomerization, dewaxing, and hydrocracking (e.g., naphtha to light olefins, higher to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, alkylation, transalkylation, disproportionation or isomerization of aromatics) . Other conversions include the reaction of alcohols with olefins and the conversion of oxygenates to hydrocarbons.</p><p num="p0020">Conversion of oxygenates may be carried out with the oxygenate, e.g., methanol , in the liquid or, preferably, the vapour phase, in batch or, preferably, continuous mode. When carried out in continuous mode, a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) based on oxygenate, of advantageously 1 to 1000, preferably 1 to 100, hour<sup>"1</sup> may conveniently be used. An elevated temperature is generally required to obtain economic conversion rates, e.g., one between 300 and 600°C, preferably from 400 to 500°C, and more preferably about 450°C.
