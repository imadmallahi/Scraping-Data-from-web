The inventive composition comprises at least one oxidation dye precursor, optionally one or more couplers, and at least one anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain.</p><p>It is known to dye keratin fibers, and in particular human hair, with dye compositions containing oxidation dye precursors, generally known as "oxidation bases", in particular ortho- or para-phenylenediamines, ortho- or para-aminophenols and heterocyclic bases.</p><p>Oxidation dye precursors are compounds that are initially colorless or only slightly colored, which develop their dyeing power on the hair in the presence of oxidizing agents, leading to the formation of colored compounds. The formation of these colored compounds results either from an oxidative condensation of the "oxidation bases" with themselves or from an oxidative condensation of the "oxidation bases" with color modifier compounds, or "couplers", which are generally present in the dye compositions used in oxidation dyeing and are represented more particularly by meta-phenylenediamines, meta-aminophenols, meta-diphenols, and certain heterocyclic compounds.</p><p>The variety of molecules used, which include, on the one hand, "oxidation bases" and, on the other hand, "couplers", allows a very broad range of colors to be obtained.</p><p>In order to localize the oxidation dye product to application on the hair so that it does not run down the face or outside of the areas which one wishes to dye, use has been made prior to this point in time of traditional thickeners such as crosslinked polyacrylic acid, hydroxyethylcelluloses, waxes or alternatively mixtures of nonionic surfactants with an HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) which, when suitably chosen, bring about a gelling effect when they are diluted with water and/or surfactants.</p><p>However, the inventors have observed that the ingredients of the traditional thickener, surfactant and solvent type generally decrease the uptake of the dye on the fibers, which is reflected by a dull shade and also by the necessary use of more dye, solvent and/or surfactants to solubilize the dye if it is desired to obtain an intense shade. Moreover, the inventors have also observed that after mixing with an oxidant, the dye compositions containing the oxidation dye precursor or precursors and optionally the coupler or couplers, and also the above-mentioned ingredients, lost some of their gelled nature and consequently led to undesirable running.</p><p>Now, after considerable research conducted in this direction, the inventors have discovered that it is possible to obtain oxidation dye compositions (after mixing with the oxidant) which do not run and therefore remain better localized at the point of application, and which also make it possible to obtain more chromatic (more luminous) shades while at the same time being appreciably intense, if an effective amount of an anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain, are introduced (i) either into the composition containing the oxidation dye precursor or precursors and optionally the coupler or couplers [or composition (A)], or (ii) into the oxidizing composition [or composition (B)], or (iii) into both compositions at the same time.</p><p>For purposes of the present invention, the chromaticity (luminosity) is defined by the value c* in the L*, a*, b* colorimetric notation system of the Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (C.I.E.) (International Lighting Commission). This value (c*) is equal to the square root of the sum a.sup.2 +b.sup.2 (+a is red, -a is green, +b is yellow, -b is blue). The shade is proportionately more luminous the higher the value of c*.</p><p>In this system of notation, L* defines the intensity of the shade. The shade is proportionately more intense the smaller the value of L* (0=black, 100=white).</p><p>These discoveries form the basis of the present invention.</p><p>A subject of the present invention is thus an oxidation dye composition for keratin fibers, in particular for human keratin fibers such as the hair, this composition comprising, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation dye precursor (oxidation base) and, where appropriate, one or more couplers, which composition is characterized in that it also contains at least one anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain.</p><p>By means of the present invention, it is also possible, advantageously, to reduce the consumption of surfactants, or even to dispense with them altogether.</p><p>The present invention also makes it possible to decrease the amount of active coloring materials used in the dye compositions, relative to conventional techniques known in the prior art.</p><p>Another subject of the present invention relates to a ready-to-use composition for dyeing keratin fibers, which contains at least one oxidation dye precursor and optionally at least one coupler, and at least one anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain, and an oxidizing agent.</p><p>The invention is also directed towards a process for dyeing keratin fibers, and in particular human keratin fibers such as the hair, this process comprising applying to these fibers at least one composition (A1) containing, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation dye precursor and optionally at least one coupler, in combination with at least one anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain, the color being developed at alkaline, neutral or acidic pH using an oxidizing agent which is mixed with the composition (A1) only at the time of use or which is present in a composition (B1) that is applied sequentially without intermediate rinsing.</p><p>The invention is also directed towards a variant of the above process, which comprises applying to the fibers at least one composition (A2) containing, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation dye precursor and optionally at least one coupler, and doing so in the presence or absence of an anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain, the color being developed at alkaline, neutral or acidic pH using an oxidizing composition (B2) which contains an oxidizing agent and an effective amount of at least one anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain. Composition (B2) is mixed with composition (A2) only at the time of use or is applied sequentially without intermediate rinsing.</p><p>Another subject of the invention is multi-compartment dyeing devices or "kits", a first compartment of which contains at least one oxidation dye precursor, optionally at least one coupler, and at least one anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain, and a second compartment of which contains an oxidizing agent.</p><p>According to another variant, the present invention also includes multi-compartment dyeing devices or "kits", a first compartment of which contains at least one oxidation dye precursor, optionally at least one coupler, and does so in the presence or absence of anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain, and a second compartment of which contains an oxidizing agent and an effective amount of at least one anionic amphiphilic polymer containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain.</p><p>The invention also relates to the use of the oxidation dye composition defined above or a multi-compartment dyeing device or "kit" as defined above in order to dye human keratin fibers such as the hair.</p><p>Other characteristics, aspects, objects and advantages of the invention will become even more apparent on reading the description and the examples which follow.</p><p>The anionic amphiphilic polymers containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain which are used according to the invention are preferably selected from those in which the hydrophilic unit contains an ethylenic unsaturated anionic monomer, more particularly a vinyl carboxylic acid and most particularly an acrylic acid, a methacrylic acid or mixtures thereof, and whose allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain corresponds to the monomer of formula (I) below:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->CH.sub.2 ═CR'CH.sub.2 OB.sub.n R                       (I)</pre></p><p>in which R' denotes H or CH.sub.3, B denotes the ethylenoxy radical, n is zero or denotes an integer ranging from 1 to 100, R denotes a hydrocarbon radical selected from alkyl, arylalkyl, aryl, alkylaryl and cycloalkyl radicals which contain from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 10 to 24, and even more particularly from 12 to 18 carbon atoms.</p><p>A unit of formula (I) more particularly preferred according to the present invention is a unit in which R' denotes H, n is equal to 10 and R denotes a stearyl (C18) radical.</p><p>Anionic amphiphilic polymers of this type are described and prepared, according to an emulsion polymerization process in European Patent EP-0,216,479 B2, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p>Among these anionic amphiphilic polymers, polymers formed of 20 to 60% by weight acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid, of 5 to 60% by weight lower alkyl (meth)acrylates, of 2 to 50% by weight allyl ether containing a fatty chain of formula (I), and of 0 to 1% by weight of a crosslinking agent which is a well-known copolymerizable polyethylenic unsaturated monomer, for instance diallyl phthalate, allyl (meth)acrylate, divinylbenzene, (poly)ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and methylenebisacrylamide, are more particularly preferred according to the invention.</p><p>Among the latter, crosslinked terpolymers of methacrylic acid, of ethyl acrylate, of polyethylene glycol (10 EO) ether of stearyl alcohol (Steareth 10), in particular those sold by the company Allied Colloids under the names SALCARE SC80 and SALCARE SC90, which are aqueous emulsions containing 30% of a crosslinked terpolymer of methacrylic acid, of ethyl acrylate and of steareth-10 allyl ether (40/50/10), are most particularly preferred.</p><p>The anionic amphiphilic polymers containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one allyl ether unit containing a fatty chain according to the invention are preferably used in an amount which may range approximately from 0.05 to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the dye composition applied to the fibers.
