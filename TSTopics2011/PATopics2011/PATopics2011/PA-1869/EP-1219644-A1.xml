transfer complexes; organic superconductors; boron nitride
(BN); layered titanates; and metal phosphates such as zirconium

generally means a layer structure-carrying crystal, which is
composed of an overlap of (i) a two-dimensional sheet like
material, wherein SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedrons are connected with one
another at their three vertexes, and (ii) an ion such as an

subjected to lipophilic treatment. Examples of said organic
solvent are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and heptane
and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene.</p><p num="0037">The above-mentioned "lipophilic treatment" means an
exchange of a cation adsorbed on a surface of the smectites
group with an organic cation. More specifically, almost all
of the smectites group have a negative charge on their surfaces,
and a cation is adsorbed on the surface to neutralize said
negative charge. Accordingly, when such smectites group is
contacted with a solution containing an organic cation
different from the cation adsorbed thereon, an exchange
reaction between the adsorbed cation and the organic cation
in the solution occurs in a moment. As a result, the smectites
group having an affinity to an organic substance, namely, the
smectites group subjected to lipophilic treatment can be 
obtained.</p><p num="0038">Examples of the above-mentioned organic cation are ions
such as an organic ammonium ion and an organic complex ion.
Of these, particularly preferred is a quaternary ammonium ion.</p><p num="0039">An example of a process for the lipophilic treatment
of the smectites group is a process which comprises the steps
of (1) dispersing a purified smectites group in water, (2)
adding a solution containing an organic ion thereto, and (3)
dehydrating and drying precipitates produced.</p> <p num="0040">In order to avoid unfavorable effects owing to impurities
such as water adsorbed on the inorganic fine particle or active
hydrogen-carrying groups such as hydroxyl group present on
the surface of said inorganic fine particle, it is recommendable
to use an inorganic finc particle treated with a compound such
as an organic magnesium compound and an organic aluminum
compound, which magnesium or aluminum compound has a high
reactivity to water or the hydroxyl group. An example of a
process for such treating is a process which comprises the
steps of (1) mixing about 1 to 10 mmol of an organic magnesium
compound or an organic aluminum compound, 1 g of the inorganic
fine particle and an organic solvent, and (2) stirring the
mixture for about 1 hour at ambient temperature.</p> <p num="0041">Examples of the ester compound are esters of
mono-carboxylic acid and esters of poly-carboxylic acid. As

carboxylic acid esters, unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acid

phthalate, methyl ethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate,
