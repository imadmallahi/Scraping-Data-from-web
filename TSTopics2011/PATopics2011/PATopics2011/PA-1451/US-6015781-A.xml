More particularly, the invention is directed to detergent compositions containing a bleaching agent, aluminosilicate, silicate, and/or detersive enzyme and a selected mid-chain branched surfactant.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Most conventional detergent compositions contain mixtures of various detersive surfactant components. Commonly encountered surfactant components include various anionic surfactants, especially the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl alkoxy sulfates and various nonionic surfactants, such as alkyl ethoxylates and alkylphenol ethoxylates. Surfactants have found use as detergent components capable of the removal of a wide variety of soils and stains. A consistent effort however is made by detergent manufacturers to improve detersive properties of detergent compositions by providing new and improved surfactants.</p><p>A problem commonly associated with anionic surfactants is their sensitivity to cold water and/or hard water. It is the surprising finding of the present invention that in comparison to known anionic surfactant components, the mid-chain branched surfactants utilized herein provide improved cleaning performance, especially for granular detergent compositions to be used under colder wash water conditions and/or in hard water. The cleaning results obtained by using these mid-chain branched surfactants in combination with bleaching agents are particularly desirable.</p><p>An advantage of the present invention is the improved cleaning performance, over a wide variety of soils and stains, of the detergent composition formulated with the mid-chain branched surfactants.</p><heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading><p>U.S. Pat. No. 3,480,556 to deWitt, et al., Nov. 25, 1969, EP 439,316, published by Lever Jul. 31, 1991, and EP 684,300, published by Lever Nov. 29, 1995, describe beta-branched alkyl sulfates. EP 439,316 describes certain laundry detergents containing a specific commercial C14/C15 branched primary alkyl sulfate, namely LIAL 145 sulfate. This is believed to have 61% branching in the 2-position; 30% of this involves branching with a hydrocarbon chain having four or more carbon atoms. U.S. Pat. No. 3,480,556 describes mixtures of from 10 to 90 parts of a straight chain primary alkyl sulfate and from 90 to 10 parts of a beta branched (2-position branched) primary alcohol sulfate of formula: ##STR1## wherein the total number of carbon atoms ranges from 12 to 20 and R1 is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 9 to 17 carbon atoms and R2 is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 1 to 9 carbon atoms (67% 2-methyl and 33% 2-ethyl branching is exemplified).</p><p>As noted hereinbefore, R. G. Laughlin in "The Aqueous Phase Behavior of Surfactants", Academic Press, N.Y. (1994) p. 347 describes the observation that as branching moves away from the 2-alkyl position towards the center of the alkyl hydrophobe there is a lowering of Krafft temperatures. See also Finger et al., "Detergent alcohols--the effect of alcohol structure and molecular weight on surfactant properties", J. Amer. Oil Chemists' Society, Vol. 44, p. 525 (1967) and Technical Bulletin, Shell Chemical Co., SC: 364-80.</p><p>EP 342,917 A, Unilever, published Nov. 23, 1989 describes laundry detergents containing a surfactant system in which the major anionic surfactant is an alkyl sulfate having an assertedly "wide range" of alkyl chain lengths (the experimental appears to involve mixing coconut and tallow chain length surfactants).</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,102,823 and GB 1,399,966 describe other laundry compositions containing conventional alkyl sulfates.</p><p>G.B. Patent 1,299,966, Matheson et al., published Jul. 2, 1975, discloses a detergent composition in which the surfactant system is comprised of a mixture of sodium tallow alkyl sulfate and nonionic surfactants.</p><p>Methyl-substituted sulfates include the known "isostearyl" sulfates; these are typically mixtures of isomeric sulfates having a total of 18 carbon atoms. For example, EP 401,462 A, assigned to Henkel, published Dec. 12, 1990, describes certain isostearyl alcohols and ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and their sulfation to produce the corresponding alkyl sulfates such as sodium isostearyl sulfate.

Chem., Vol. 95, (1991), pp 1671-1676 (which describes the surface tensions of a variety of "linear Guerbet" and "branched Guerbet"--class surfactants including alkyl sulfates); Varadaraj et al., J. Colloid and Interface Sci., Vol. 140, (1990), pp 31-34 (relating to foaming data for surfactants which include C12 and C13 alkyl sulfates containing 3 and 4 methyl branches, respectively); and Varadaraj et al., Langmuir, Vol. 6 (1990), pp 1376-1378 (which describes the micropolarity of aqueous micellar solutions of surfactants including branched alkyl sulfates).</p><p>"Linear Guerbet" alcohols are available from Henkel, e.g., EUTANOL G-16.</p><p>Primary akyl sulfates derived from alcohols made by Oxo reaction on propylene or n-butylene oligomers are described in U.S. Pat.

Peroxide bleach is very hydrophilic and, while it cannot match the bleaching effectiveness delivered by peracids (formed for example from peroxide interaction with TAED), it is effective at decoloration of pigments (e.g., in particulates or beverage stains) and also can help remove the color from the organic residues associated with body soils. Unexpectedly, it has now been discovered that compositions containing mid-chain branched surfactant surfactants and bleaching agents deliver superior cleaning and whiteness performance.</p><p>This invention also provides detergent compositions which deliver effective cleaning of soils and stains by means of bleach activators, preferably hydrophobic bleach activators, used in combination with a mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant useful in the present compositions and methods. Everyday soil cleaning and whiteness benefits for bleach activators and peracids have already been demonstrated. It has now been found that detergent and bleach compositions containing mid-chain branched surfactants and bleach activators (including preformed peracids) deliver superior cleaning and whiteness performance.</p><p>This invention also provides compositions which deliver effective cleaning of soils and stains via use of bleach catalysts in the present invention compositions and methods. Bleach catalysts (characterized by the presence of at least one transition metal atom) interact with peroxide to form very powerful hydrophilic bleaches. These bleaches deliver strong benefits on colored hydrophilic stains and hydrophilic everyday soils (i.e., socks). The catalysts are typically used at extremely low levels in cleaning products. As disclosed herein, products containing mid-chain branched surfactants and bleaching agents, with catalysts, deliver superior cleaning and whiteness performance. It is to be recognized, however, that historical use of bleach catalysts has been made difficult because of concerns about fabric damage (dimanganese catalysts are known to cause fabric damage), and thus such concerns must be considered when formulating compositions according to the present invention containing bleach catalysts.</p><p>This invention further provides compositions which deliver effective cleaning of soils and stains via use of builders selected from aluminosilicates, silicates, and mixtures thereof in the present invention compositions in granular form and methods.</p><p>In addition, the present invention provides compositions which deliver effective cleaning of soils and stains via use of detersive enzymes in the present invention compositions and methods.</p><p>Mid-Chain Branched Surfactant</p><p>An essential component of the liquid cleaning compositions of the present invention is an mid-chain branched surfactant. The mid-chain branched surfactant is selected from the following.</p><p>The present invention relates to liquid compositions comprising mid-chain branched surfactant compounds as described herein before. In such compositions, certain points of branching (e.g., the location along the chain of the R, R.sup.1, and/or R.sup.2 moieties in the above formula) are preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the surfactant. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range (i.e., where points of branching occur), preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl branched alkyl A.sup.b moieties useful according to the present invention. ##STR2## It should be noted that for the mono-methyl substituted surfactants these ranges exclude the two terminal carbon atoms of the chain and the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the --X--B group.</p><p>The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range, preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for di-methyl substituted alkyl A.sup.b moieties useful according to the present invention. ##STR3##</p><p>The preferred branched surfactant compositions useful in cleaning compositions according to the present invention are described in more detail hereinafter.</p><p>(1) Mid-Chain Branched Primary Alkyl Sulfate Surfactants</p><p>The present invention branched surfactant compositions may comprise two or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants having the formula ##STR4##</p><p>The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkyl sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.</p><p>For example, a C16 total carbon primary alkyl sulfate surfactant having 13 carbon atoms in the backbone must have 1, 2, or 3 branching units (i.e., R, R.sup.1 and/or R.sup.3) whereby total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is at least 16. In this example, the C16 total carbon requirement may be satisfied equally by having, for example, one propyl branching unit or three methyl branching units.</p><p>R, R.sup.1, and R.sup.2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C.sub.1 -C.sub.3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C.sub.1 -C.sub.2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R.sup.1, and R.sup.2 are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 1, at least R or R.sup.1 is not hydrogen.</p><p>Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R.sup.1, and R.sup.2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary alkyl sulfate. Further, this linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate may be admixed into the final product formulation.</p><p>Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol may comprise some amount of the present invention compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete sulfation of the alcohol used to prepare the alkyl sulfate surfactant, or these alcohols may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant according to the present invention.</p><p>M is hydrogen or a salt forming cation depending upon the method of synthesis.

After conventional acid hydrolysis, acetylation and thermal elimination of acetic acid, an intermediate olefin is produced (not shown in the scheme) which is hydrogenated forthwith using any convenient hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd/C.</p><p>This route is favorable over others in that the branch, in this illustration a 5-methyl branch, is introducedearly in the reaction sequence.</p><p>Formylation of the alkyl halide resulting from the first hydrogenation step yields alcohol product, as shown in the scheme. This can be alkoxylated using standard techniques and/or sulfated using any convenient sulfating agent, e.g., chlorosulfonic acid, SO3/air, or oleum, to yield the final branched primary alkyl surfactant. There is flexibility to extend the branching one additional carbon beyond that which is achieved by a single formylation. Such extension can, for example, be accomplished by reaction with ethylene oxide. See "Grignard Reactions of Nonmetallic Substances", M. S. Kharasch and O. Reinmuth, Prentice-Hall, N.Y., 1954; J. Org. Chem., J. Cason and W. R. Winans, Vol. 15 (1950), pp 139-147; J. Org Chem., J. Cason et al., Vol. 13 (1948), pp 239-248; J. Org Chem., J. Cason et al., Vol. 14 (1949), pp 147-154; and J.

Cason et al., Vol. 15 (1950), pp 135-138 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>In variations of the above procedure, alternate haloketones or Grignard reagents may be used. PBr3 halogenation of the alcohol from formylation or ethoxylation can be used to accomplish an iterative chain extension.</p><p>The preferred mid-chained branched primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfates (as well as the polyoxyalkylenes and alkyl sulfates, by choosing to only alkoxylate or sulfate the intermediate alcohol produced) of the present invention can also be readily prepared as follows: ##STR30##</p><p>A conventional bromoalcohol is reacted with triphenylphosphine followed by sodium hydride, suitably in dimethylsulfoxide/tetrahydrofuran, to form a Wittig adduct. The Wittig adduct is reacted with an alpha methyl ketone, forming an internally unsaturated methyl-branched alcoholate. Hydrogenation followed by alkoxylation and/or sulfation yields the desired mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant. Although the Wittig approach does not allow the practitioner to extend the hydrocarbon chain, as in the Grignard sequence, the Wittig typically affords higher yields. See Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, M. Horiike et al., vol. 42 (1978), pp 1963-1965 included herein by reference.</p><p>Any alternative synthetic procedure in accordance with the invention may be used to prepare the branched primary alkyl surfactants. The mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactants may, in addition be synthesized or formulated in the presence of the conventional homologs, for example any of those which may be formed in an industrial process which produces 2-alkyl branching as a result of hydroformylation. Mid-chain branched surfactant mixtures of the present invention are routinely added to other known commercial alkyl surfactants contained in the final laundry product formulation.</p><p>In certain preferred embodiments of the surfactant mixtures of the present invention, especially those derived from fossil fuel sources involving commercial processes, comprise at least 1 mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant, preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 5, most preferably at least 8.</p><p>Particularly suitable for preparation of certain surfactant mixtures of the present invention are "oxo" reactions wherein a branched chain olefin is subjected to catalytic isomerization and hydroformylation prior to alkoxylation and/or sulfation. The preferred processes resulting in such mixtures utilize fossil fuels as the starting material feedstock. Preferred processes utilize Oxo reaction on linear olefins (alpha or internal) with a limited amount of branching. Suitable olefins may be made by dimerization of linear alpha or internal olefins, by controlled oligomerization of low molecular weight linear olefins, by skeletal rearrangement of detergent range olefins, by dehydrogenation/skeletal rearrangement of detergent range paraffins, or by Fischer-Tropsch reaction. These reactions will in general be controlled to:</p><p>1) give a large proportion of olefins in the desired detergent range (while allowing for the addition of a carbon atom in the subsequent Oxo reaction),</p><p>2) produce a limited number of branches, preferably mid-chain,</p><p>3) produce C.sub.1 -C.sub.3 branches, more preferably ethyl, most preferably methyl,</p><p>4) limit or eliminate gem dialkyl branching i.e. to avoid formation of quaternary carbon atoms. The suitable olefins can undergo Oxo reaction to give primary alcohols either directly or indirectly through the corresonding aldehydes. When an internal olefin is used, an Oxo catalyst is normally used which is capable of prior pre-isomerization of internal olefins primarily to alpha olefins. While a separately catalyzed (i.e. non-Oxo) internal to alpha isomerization could be effected, this is optional. On the other hand, if the olefin-forming step itself results directly in an alpha olefin (e.g. with high pressure Fischer-Tropsch olefins of detergent range), then use of a non-isomerizing Oxo catalyst is not only possible, but preferred.</p><p>The process described herein above gives the more preferred 5-methylhexadecyl surfactants in higher yield than the less preferred 2,4-dimethylpentadecyl surfactants. This mixture is desirable under the metes and bounds of the present invention in that each product comprises at total of 17 carbon atoms with linear alkyl chains having at least 13 carbon atoms.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><p>The following examples provide methods for synthesizing various compounds useful in the present invention compositions.</p><heading>EXAMPLE I</heading><heading>Preparation of sodium 7-methylhexadecyl ethoxylate (E2) and ethoxylated sulfate</heading><heading>Synthesis of (6-hydroxyhexyl) triphenylphosphonium bromide</heading><p>Into a 5L, 3 neck round bottom flask fitted with nitrogen inlet, condenser, thermometer, mechanical stirring and nitrogen outlet is added 6-bromo-1-hexanol (500 g, 2.76 mol), triphenylphosphine (768 g, 2.9 mol) and acetonitrile (1800 ml) under nitrogen.

In order to obtain such levels in the wash liquor of an automatic washing process, typical compositions herein will comprise from about 0.0005% to about 0.2%, more preferably from about 0.004% to about 0.08%, of bleach catalyst, especially manganese or cobalt catalysts, by weight of the cleaning compositions.</p><p>Enzymes--Enzymes are preferably included in the present detergent compositions for a variety of purposes, including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceride-based stains from substrates, for the prevention of refugee dye transfer in fabric laundering, and for fabric restoration. Suitable enzymes include proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Preferred selections are influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active detergents, builders and the like. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases.</p><p>"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry, hard surface cleaning or personal care detergent composition. Preferred detersive enzymes are hydrolases such as proteases, amylases and lipases. Preferred enzymes for laundry purposes include, but are not limited to, proteases, cellulases, lipases and peroxidases. Highly preferred for automatic dishwashing are amylases and/or proteases, including both current commercially available types and improved types which, though more and more bleach compatible though successive improvements, have a remaining degree of bleach deactivation susceptibility.</p><p>Enzymes are normally incorporated into detergent or detergent additive compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount". The term "cleaning effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics, dishware and the like. In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition. For certain detergents, such as in automatic dishwashing, it may be desirable to increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve spotting/filming or other end-results. Higher active levels may also be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.</p><p>Suitable examples of proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. One suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold as ESPERASE Novo Industries A/S of Denmark, hereinafter "Novo". The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1,243,784 to Novo. Other suitable proteases include ALCALASE and MAXATASE Netherlands; as well as Protease A as disclosed in EP 130,756 A, Jan. 9, 1985 and Protease B as disclosed in EP 303,761 A, Apr. 28, 1987 and EP 130,756 A, Jan. 9, 1985.

See, for example J. Biological Chem., Vol. 260, No. 11, June 1985, pp. 6518-6521. Certain preferred embodiments of the present compositions can make use of amylases having improved stability in detergents such as automatic dishwashing types, especially improved oxidative stability as measured against a reference-point of TERMAMYL in commercial use in 1993. These preferred amylases herein share the characteristic of being "stability-enhanced" amylases, characterized, at a minimum, by a measurable improvement in one or more of: oxidative stability, e.g., to hydrogen peroxide/tetraacetylethylenediamine in buffered solution at pH 9-10; thermal stability, e.g., at common wash temperatures such as about 60 a pH from about 8 to about 11, measured versus the above-identified reference-point amylase. Stability can be measured using any of the art-disclosed technical tests. See, for example, references disclosed in WO 9402597. Stability-enhanced amylases can be obtained from Novo or from Genencor International. One class of highly preferred amylases herein have the commonality of being derived using site-directed mutagenesis from one or more of the Bacillus amylases, especially the Bacillus α-amylases, regardless of whether one, two or multiple amylase strains are the immediate precursors. Oxidative stability-enhanced amylases vs. the above-identified reference amylase are preferred for use, especially in bleaching, more preferably oxygen bleaching, as distinct from chlorine bleaching, detergent compositions herein. Such preferred amylases include (a) an amylase according to the hereinbefore incorporated WO 9402597, Novo, Feb. 3, 1994, as further illustrated by a mutant in which substitution is made, using alanine or threonine, preferably threonine, of the methionine residue located in position 197 of the B. licheniformis alpha-amylase, known as TERMAMYL position variation of a similar parent amylase, such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, or B. stearothermophilus; (b) stability-enhanced amylases as described by Genencor International in a paper entitled "Oxidatively Resistant alpha-Amylases" presented at the 207th American Chemical Society National Meeting, Mar. 13-17 1994, by C. Mitchinson. Therein it was noted that bleaches in automatic dishwashing detergents inactivate alpha-amylases but that improved oxidative stability amylases have been made by Genencor from B. licheniformis NCIB8061. Methionine (Met) was identified as the most likely residue to be modified. Met was substituted, one at a time, in positions 8, 15, 197, 256, 304, 366 and 438 leading to specific mutants, particularly important being M197L and M197T with the M197T variant being the most stable expressed variant. Stability was measured in CASCADE preferred amylases herein include amylase variants having additional modification in the immediate parent as described in WO 9510603 A and are available from the assignee, Novo, as DURAMYL preferred oxidative stability enhanced amylase include those described in WO 9418314 to Genencor International and WO 9402597 to Novo. Any other oxidative stability-enhanced amylase can be used, for example as derived by site-directed mutagenesis from known chimeric, hybrid or simple mutant parent forms of available amylases. Other preferred enzyme modifications are accessible. See WO 9509909 A to Novo.</p><p>Other amylase enzymes include those described in WO 95/26397 and in co-pending application by Novo Nordisk PCT/DK96/00056. Specific amylase enzymes for use in the detergent compositions of the present invention include α-amylases characterized by having a specific activity at least 25% higher than the specific activity of Termamyl temperature range of 25 the range of 8 to 10, measured by the Phadebas activity assay. (Such Phadebas described at pages 9-10, WO 95/26397). Also included herein are a-amylases which are at least 80% homologous with the amino acid sequences shown in the SEQ ID listings in the references. These enzymes are preferably incorporated into laundry detergent compositions at a level from 0.00018% to 0.060% pure enzyme by weight of the total composition, more preferably from 0.00024% to 0.048% pure enzyme by weight of the total composition.</p><p>Cellulases usable herein include both bacterial and fungal types, preferably having a pH optimum between 5 and 9.5. U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,307, Barbesgoard et al, Mar. 6, 1984, discloses suitable fungal cellulases from Humicola insolens or Humicola strain DSM1800 or a cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas, and cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk, Dolabella Auricula Solander. Suitable cellulases are also disclosed in GB-A-2.075.028; GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832. CAREZYME useful. See also WO 9117243 to Novo.</p><p>Suitable lipase enzymes for detergent usage include those produced by microorganisms of the Pseudomonas group, such as Pseudomonas stutzeri ATCC 19.154, as disclosed in GB 1,372,034. See also lipases in Japanese Patent Application 53,20487, laid open Feb. 24, 1978. This lipase is available from Amano Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan, under the trade name Lipase P "Amano," or "Amano-P." Other suitable commercial lipases include Amano-CES, lipases ex Chromobacter viscosum, e.g. Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRLB 3673 from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan; Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S. Biochemical Corp., U.S.A. and Disoynth Co., The Netherlands, and lipases ex Pseudomonas gladioli. LIPOLASE available from Novo, see also EP 341,947, is a preferred lipase for use herein. Lipase and amylase variants stabilized against peroxidase enzymes are described in WO 9414951 A to Novo. See also WO 9205249 and RD 94359044.</p><p>In spite of the large number of publications on lipase enzymes, only the lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa and produced in Aspergillus oryzae as host has so far found widespread application as additive for fabric washing products. It is available from Novo Nordisk under the tradename Lipolase™, as noted above. In order to optimize the stain removal performance of Lipolase, Novo Nordisk have made a number of variants. As described in WO 92/05249, the D96L variant of the native Humicola lanuginosa lipase improves the lard stain removal efficiency by a factor 4.4 over the wild-type lipase (enzymes compared in an amount ranging from 0.075 to 2.5 mg protein per liter). Research Disclosure No. 35944 published on Mar. 10, 1994, by Novo Nordisk discloses that the lipase variant (D96L) may be added in an amount corresponding to 0.001-100-mg (5-500,000 LU/liter) lipase variant per liter of wash liquor. The present invention provides the benefit of improved whiteness maintenance on fabrics using low levels of D96L variant in detergent compositions containing the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactants in the manner disclosed herein, especially when the D96L is used at levels in the range of about 50 LU to about 8500 LU per liter of wash solution.</p><p>Cutinase enzymes suitable for use herein are described in WO 8809367 A to Genencor.</p><p>Peroxidase enzymes may be used in combination with oxygen sources, e.g., percarbonate, perborate, hydrogen peroxide, etc., for "solution bleaching" or prevention of transfer of dyes or pigments removed from substrates during the wash to other substrates present in the wash solution. Known peroxidases include horseradish peroxidase, ligninase, and haloperoxidases such as chloro- or bromo-peroxidase. Peroxidase-containing detergent compositions are disclosed in WO 89099813 A, Oct. 19, 1989 to Novo and WO 8909813 A to Novo.</p><p>A range of enzyme materials and means for their incorporation into synthetic detergent compositions is also disclosed in WO 9307263 A and WO 9307260 A to Genencor International, WO 8908694 A to Novo, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,553,139, Jan. 5, 1971 to McCarty et al. Enzymes are further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,457, Place et al, Jul. 18, 1978, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,219, Hughes, Mar. 26, 1985. Enzyme materials useful for liquid detergent formulations, and their incorporation into such formulations, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,261,868, Hora et al, Apr. 14, 1981. Enzymes for use in detergents can be stabilised by various techniques. Enzyme stabilisation techniques are disclosed and exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 3,600,319, Aug. 17, 1971, Gedge et al, EP 199,405 and EP 200,586, Oct. 29, 1986, Venegas. Enzyme stabilisation systems are also described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,519,570. A useful Bacillus, sp. AC13 giving proteases, xylanases and cellulases, is described in WO 9401532 A to Novo.</p><p>Enzyme Stabilizing System--The enzyme-containing compositions herein may optionally also comprise from about 0.001% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.005% to about 8%, most preferably from about 0.01% to about 6%, by weight of an enzyme stabilizing system. The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme. Such a system may be inherently provided by other formulation actives, or be added separately, e.g., by the formulator or by a manufacturer of detergent-ready enzymes. Such stabilizing systems can, for example, comprise calcium ion, boric acid, propylene glycol, short chain carboxylic acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, and are designed to address different stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent composition.</p><p>One stabilizing approach is the use of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the finished compositions which provide such ions to the enzymes. Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred herein if only one type of cation is being used. Typical detergent compositions, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 millimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium or magnesium salts are employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium malate, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the exemplified calcium salts may be used. Further increased levels of Calcium and/or Magnesium may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of surfactant.</p><p>Another stabilizing approach is by use of borate species. See Severson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,537,706. Borate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or other borate compounds such as borax or orthoborate are suitable for liquid detergent use. Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, p-bromophenylboronic acid or the like can be used in place of boric acid and reduced levels of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such substituted boron derivatives.</p><p>Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions, for example automatic dishwashing compositions, may further comprise from 0 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the enzymes, especially under alkaline conditions. While chlorine levels in water may be small, typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during dish- or fabric-washing, can be relatively large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-use is sometimes problematic. Since perborate or percarbonate, which have the ability to react with chlorine bleach, may present in certain of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be essential, though improved results may be obtainable from their use. Suitable chlorine scavenger anions are widely known and readily available, and, if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosulfite, thiosulfate, iodide, etc. Antioxidants such as carbamate, ascorbate, etc., organic amines such as ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, monoethanolamine (MEA), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used. Likewise, special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have maximum compatibility. Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfate, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, lactate, malate, tartrate, salicylate, etc., and mixtures thereof can be used if desired. In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by ingredients separately listed under better recognized fictions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide sources), there is no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a compound performing that functions to the desired extent is absent from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results. Moreover, the formulator will exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is majorly incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive ingredients. In relation to the use of ammonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but are prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage. Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,392, Baginski et al.</p><p>Builders--Detergent builders selected from aluminosilicates and silicates are preferably included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of particulate soils from surfaces.</p><p>Suitable silicate builders include water-soluble and hydrous solid types and including those having chain-, layer-, or three-dimensional- structure as well as amorphous-solid or non-structured-liquid types. Preferred are alkali metal silicates, particularly those liquids and solids having a SiO.sub.2 :Na.sub.2 O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1, including, particularly for automatic dishwashing purposes, solid hydrous 2-ratio silicates marketed by PQ Corp. under the tradename BRITESIL BRITESIL H2O; and layered silicates, e.g., those described in U.S. Pat.

Layered silicates from Hoechst also include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the α, β and γ layer-silicate forms. Other silicates may also be useful, such as magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granules, as a stabilising agent for bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.</p><p>Also suitable for use herein are synthesized crystalline ion exchange materials or hydrates thereof having chain structure and a composition represented by the following general formula in an anhydride form: xM.sub.2 O.ySiO.sub.2.zM'O wherein M is Na and/or K, M' is Ca and/or Mg; y/x is 0.5 to 2.0 and z/x is 0.005 to 1.0 as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,711, Sakaguchi et al, Jun. 27, 1995.</p><p>Aluminosilicate builders are especially useful in granular detergents, but can also be incorporated in liquids, pastes or gels. Suitable for the present purposes are those having empirical formula: [M.sub.z (AlO.sub.2).sub.z (SiO.sub.2).sub.v ].xH.sub.2 O wherein z and v are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to v is in the range from 1.0 to 0.5, and x is an integer from 15 to 264. Aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived. An aluminosilicate production method is in U.S. Pat. No. 3,985,669, Krummel, et al, Oct. 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are available as Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite X and, to whatever extent this differs from Zeolite P, the so-called Zeolite MAP. Natural types, including clinoptilolite, may be used. Zeolite A has the formula: Na.sub.12 [(AlO.sub.2).sub.12 (SiO.sub.2).sub.12 ].xH.sub.2 O wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. Dehydrated zeolites (x=0-10) may also be used. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0.1-10 microns in diameter.</p><p>Additional Detergent Components</p><p>The detergent compositions of the invention may also contain additional detergent components. The precise nature of these additional components, and levels of incorporation thereof will depend on the physical form of the composition, and the precise nature of the washing operation for which it is to be used.</p><p>The compositions of the invention preferably contain one or more additional detergent components selected from surfactants, builders, alkalinity system, organic polymeric compounds, suds suppressors, soil suspension and anti-redeposition agents and corrosion inhibitors.</p><p>Detersive Surfactants:</p><p>The detergent compositions according to the present invention preferably further comprise additional surfactants, herein also referred to as co-surfactants, preferably selected from: anionic surfactants, preferably selected from the group of alkyl alkoxylated sulfates, alkyl sulfates, and/or linear alkyl benzenesulfonate surfactants; cationic surfactants, preferably selected from quaternary ammonium surfactants; nonionic surfactants, preferably alkyl ethoxylates, alkyl polyglucosides, and/or amine or amine oxide surfactants; amphoteric surfactants, preferably selected from betaines and/or polycarboxylates (for example polyglycinates); and zwiterionic surfactants.</p><p>A wide range of these co-surfactants can be used in the detergent compositions of the present invention.

Thus, it is not uncommon to report total EO values other than as whole numbers, e.g., "EO2.5", "EO3.5", and the like.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________Designation R.sup.1  R.sup.2 ApR.sup.3                                 A'qR.sup.4______________________________________AQA-1       C.sub.12 -C.sub.14                CH.sub.3                        EO       EO(also referred to asCoco Methyl EO2)AQA-2       C.sub.12 -C.sub.16                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.2                                 EOAQA-3       C.sub.12 -C.sub.14                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.2                                 (EO).sub.2(Coco Methyl EO4)AQA-4       C.sub.12 CH.sub.3                        EO       EOAQA-5       C.sub.12 -C.sub.14                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.2                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-6       C.sub.12 -C.sub.14                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.2                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-7       C.sub.8 -C.sub.18                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.3                                 (EO).sub.2AQA-8       C.sub.12 -C.sub.14                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.4                                 (EO).sub.4AQA-9       C.sub.12 -C.sub.14                C.sub.2 H.sub.5                        (EO).sub.3                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-10      C.sub.12 -C.sub.18                C.sub.3 H.sub.7                        (EO).sub.3                                 (EO).sub.4AQA-11      C.sub.12 -C.sub.18                CH.sub.3                        (propoxy)                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-12      C.sub.10 -C.sub.18                C.sub.2 H.sub.5                        (iso-propoxy).sub.2                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-13      C.sub.10 -C.sub.18                CH.sub.3                        (EO/PO).sub.2                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-14      C.sub.8 -C.sub.18                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.15 *                                 (EO).sub.15 *AQA-15      C.sub.10 CH.sub.3                        EO       EOAQA-16      C.sub.8 -C.sub.12                CH.sub.3                        EO       EOAQA-17      C.sub.9 -C.sub.11                CH.sub.3EO 3.5 Avg. -AQA-18      C.sub.12 CH.sub.3EO 3.5 Avg. -AQA-19      C.sub.8 -C.sub.14                CH.sub.3                        (EO).sub.10                                 (EO).sub.10AQA-20      C.sub.10 C.sub.2 H.sub.5                        (EO).sub.2                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-21      C.sub.12 -C.sub.14                C.sub.2 H.sub.5                        (EO).sub.5                                 (EO).sub.3AQA-22      C.sub.12 -C.sub.18                C.sub.3 H.sub.7                        Bu       (EO).sub.2______________________________________ *Ethoxy, optionally endcapped with methyl or ethyl.</pre></p><p>The preferred bis-ethoxylated cationic surfactants herein are available under the trade name ETHOQUAD from Akzo Nobel Chemicals Company.</p><p>Highly preferred bis-AQA compounds for use herein are of the formula ##STR42## wherein R.sup.1 is C.sub.10 -C.sub.18 hydrocarbyl and mixtures thereof, preferably C.sub.10, C.sub.12, C.sub.14 alkyl and mixtures thereof, and X is any convenient anion to provide charge balance, preferably chloride. With reference to the general AQA structure noted above, since in a preferred compound R.sup.1 is derived from coconut (C.sub.12 -C.sub.14 alkyl) fraction fatty acids, R.sup.2 is methyl and ApR.sup.3 and A'qR.sup.4 are each monoethoxy, this preferred type of compound is referred to herein as "CocoMeEO2" or "AQA-1" in the above list.</p><p>Other preferred AQA compounds herein include compounds of the formula: ##STR43## wherein R.sup.1 is C.sub.10 -C.sub.18 hydrocarbyl, preferably C.sub.10 -C.sub.14 alkyl, independently p is 1 to about 3 and q is 1 to about 3, R.sup.2 is C.sub.1 -C.sub.3 alkyl, preferably methyl, and X is an anion, especially chloride.</p><p>Other compounds of the foregoing type include those wherein the ethoxy (CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O) units (EO) are replaced by butoxy (Bu), isopropoxy [CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 O] and [CH.sub.2 CH(CH.sub.3 O] units (i-Pr) or n-propoxy units (Pr), or mixtures of EO and/or Pr and/or i-Pr units.</p><p>The following illustrates various other adjunct ingredients which may be used in the compositions of this invention, but is not intended to be limiting thereof. While the combination of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactants with such adjunct compositional ingredients can be provided as finished products in the form of liquids, gels, bars, or the like using conventional techniques, the manufacture of the granular laundry detergents herein requires some special processing techniques in order to achieve optimal performance. Accordingly, the manufacture of laundry granules will be described hereinafter separately in the Granules Manufacture section (below), for the convenience of the formulator.</p><p>Additional Builders--Detergent builders in place of or in addition to the silicates and aluminosilicates described hereinbefore can optionally be included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of particulate soils from surfaces. Builders can operate via a variety of mechanisms including forming soluble or insoluble complexes with hardness ions, by ion exchange, and by offering a surface more favorable to the precipitation of hardness ions than are the surfaces of articles to be cleaned. Builder level can vary widely depending upon end use and physical form of the composition. Built detergents typically comprise at least about 1% builder. Liquid formulations typically comprise about 5% to about 50%, more typically 5% to 35% of builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically 15% to 50% builder by weight of the detergent composition. Lower or higher levels of builders are not excluded. For example, certain detergent additive or high-surfactant formulations can be unbuilt.</p><p>Suitable builders herein can be selected from the group consisting of phosphates and polyphosphates, especially the sodium salts; carbonates, bicarbonates, sesquicarbonates and carbonate minerals other than sodium carbonate or sesquicarbonate; organic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetracarboxylates especially water-soluble nonsurfactant carboxylates in acid, sodium, potassium or alkanolammonium salt form, as well as oligomeric or water-soluble low molecular weight polymer carboxylates including aliphatic and aromatic types; and phytic acid. These may be complemented by borates, e.g., for pH-buffering purposes, or by sulfates, especially sodium sulfate and any other fillers or carriers which may be important to the engineering of stable surfactant and/or builder-containing detergent compositions.</p><p>Builder mixtures, sometimes termed "builder systems" can be used and typically comprise two or more conventional builders, optionally complemented by chelants, pH-buffers or fillers, though these latter materials are generally accounted for separately when describing quantities of materials herein. In terms of relative quantities of surfactant and builder in the present detergents, preferred builder systems are typically formulated at a weight ratio of surfactant to builder of from about 60:1 to about 1:80. Certain preferred laundry detergents have said ratio in the range 0.90:1.0 to 4.0:1.0, more preferably from 0.95:1.0 to 3.0:1</p><p>P-containing detergent builders often preferred where permitted by legislation include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, glassy polymeric meta-phosphates; and phosphonates.</p><p>Suitable carbonate builders include alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on Nov. 15, 1973, although sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate, and other carbonate minerals such as trona or any convenient multiple salts of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate such as those having the composition 2Na.sub.2 CO.sub.3.CaCO.sub.3 when anhydrous, and even calcium carbonates including calcite, aragonite and vaterite, especially forms having high surface areas relative to compact calcite may be useful, for example as seeds or for use in synthetic detergent bars.</p><p>Suitable organic detergent builders include polycarboxylate compounds, including water-soluble nonsurfactant dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates. More typically builder polycarboxylates have a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Carboxylate builders can be formulated in acid, partially neutral, neutral or overbased form. When in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred. Polycarboxylate builders include the ether polycarboxylates, such as oxydisuccinate, see Berg, U.S. Pat. No. 3,128,287, Apr. 7, 1964, and Lamberti et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,635,830, Jan. 18, 1972; "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,071, Bush et al, May 5, 1987; and other ether carboxylates including cyclic and alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.</p><p>Other suitable builders are the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether; 1 3,5-trihydroxy benzene-2,4,6-trisulphonic acid; carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid; the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid; as well as mellitic acid, succinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.</p><p>Citrates, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof are important carboxylate builders e.g., for heavy duty liquid detergents, due to availability from renewable resources and biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicates. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.</p><p>Where permitted, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, alkali metal phosphates such as sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates, e.g., those of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137 can also be used and may have desirable antiscaling properties.</p><p>Certain detersive surfactants or their short-chain homologs also have a builder action. For unambiguous formula accounting purposes, when they have surfactant capability, these materials are summed up as detersive surfactants. Preferred types for builder functionality are illustrated by: 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,984, Bush, Jan. 28, 1986. Succinic acid builders include the C.sub.5 -C.sub.20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. Succinate builders also include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Lauryl-succinates are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published Nov. 5, 1986. Fatty acids, e.g., C.sub.12 -C.sub.18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions as surfactant/builder materials alone or in combination with the aforementioned builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,144,226,Crutchfield et al, Mar. 13, 1979 and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,067, Diehl, Mar. 7, 1967. See also Diehl, U.S. Pat. No. 3,723,322.</p><p>Other types of inorganic builder materials which can be used have the formula (M.sub.x).sub.i Ca.sub.y (CO.sub.3).sub.z wherein x and i are integers from 1 to 15, y is an integer from 1 to 10, z is an integer from 2 to 25, M.sub.i are cations, at least one of which is a water-soluble, and the equation Σ.sub.i=1-15 (x.sub.i multiplied by the valence of M.sub.i)+2y=2z is satisfied such that the formula has a neutral or "balanced" charge. These builders are referred to herein as "Mineral Builders". Waters of hydration or anions other than carbonate may be added provided that the overall charge is balanced or neutral. The charge or valence effects of such anions should be added to the right side of the above equation. Preferably, there is present a water-soluble cation selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, water-soluble metals, hydrogen, boron, ammonium, silicon, and mixtures thereof, more preferably, sodium, potassium, hydrogen, lithium, ammonium and mixtures thereof, sodium and potassium being highly preferred. Nonlimiting examples of noncarbonate anions include those selected from the group consisting of chloride, sulfate, fluoride, oxygen, hydroxide, silicon dioxide, chromate, nitrate, borate and mixtures thereof. Preferred builders of this type in their simplest forms are selected from the group consisting of Na.sub.2 Ca(CO.sub.3).sub.2, K.sub.2 Ca(CO.sub.3).sub.2, Na.sub.2 Ca.sub.2 (CO.sub.3).sub.3, NaKCa(CO.sub.3).sub.2, NaKCa.sub.2 (CO.sub.3).sub.3, K.sub.2 Ca.sub.2 (CO.sub.3).sub.3, and combinations thereof. An especially preferred material for the builder described herein is Na.sub.2 Ca(CO.sub.3).sub.2 in any of its crystalline modifications. Suitable builders of the above-defined type are further illustrated by, and include, the natural or synthetic forms of any one or combinations of the following minerals: Afghanite, Andersonite, AshcroftineY, Beyerite, Borcarite, Burbankite, Butschliite, Cancrinite, Carbocemaite, Carletonite, Davyne, DonnayiteY, Fairchildite, Ferrisurite, Franzinite, Gaudefroyite, Gaylussite, Girvasite, Gregoryite, Jouravskite, KamphaugiteY, Kettnerite, Khanneshite, LepersonniteGd, Liottite, MckelveyiteY, Microsommite, Mroseite, Natrofairchildite, Nyerereite, RemonditeCe, Sacrofanite, Schrockingerite, Shortite, Surite, Tunisite, Tuscanite, Tyrolite, Vishnevite, and Zenikorite. Preferred mineral forms include Nyererite, Fairchildite and Shortite.</p><p>Polymeric Soil Release Agent--Known polymeric soil release agents, hereinafter "SRA" or "SRA's", can optionally be employed in the present detergent compositions. If utilized, SRA's will generally comprise from 0.01% to 10.0%, typically from 0.1% to 5%, preferably from 0.2% to 3.0% by weight, of the composition.</p><p>Preferred SRA's typically have hydrophilic segments to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles thereby serving as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with SRA to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.</p><p>SRA's can include a variety of charged, e.g., anionic or even cationic (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,447), as well as noncharged monomer units and structures may be linear, branched or even star-shaped. They may include capping moieties which are especially effective in controlling molecular weight or altering the physical or surface-active properties. Structures and charge distributions may be tailored for application to different fiber or textile types and for varied detergent or detergent additive products.</p><p>Preferred SRA's include oligomeric terephthalate esters, typically prepared by processes involving at least one transesterification/oligomerization, often with a metal catalyst such as a titanium(IV) alkoxide. Such esters may be made using additional monomers capable of being incorporated into the ester structure through one, two, three, four or more positions, without of course forming a densely crosslinked overall structure.</p><p>Suitable SRA's include: a sulfonated product of a substantially linear ester oligomer comprised of an oligomeric ester backbone of terephthaloyl and oxyalkyleneoxy repeat units and allyl-derived sulfonated terminal moieties covalently attached to the backbone, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,451, Nov. 6, 1990 to J. J. Scheibel and E. P. Gosselink: such ester oligomers can be prepared by (a) ethoxylating allyl alcohol, (b) reacting the product of (a) with dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") and 1,2-propylene glycol ("PG") in a two-stage transesterification/oligomerization procedure and (c) reacting the product of (b) with sodium metabisulfite in water; the nonionic end-capped 1,2-propylene/polyoxyethylene terephthalate polyesters of U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,730, Dec. 8, 1987 to Gosselink et al, for example those produced by transesterification/oligomerization of poly(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether, DMT, PG and poly(ethyleneglycol) ("PEG"); the partly- and fully- anionic-end-capped oligomeric esters of U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,580, Jan. 26, 1988 to Gosselink, such as oligomers from ethylene glycol ("EG"), PG, DMT and Na-3,6-dioxa-8-hydroxyoctanesulfonate; the nonionic-capped block polyester oligomeric compounds of U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,857, Oct. 27, 1987 to Gosselink, for example produced from DMT, Me-capped PEG and EG and/or PG, or a combination of DMT, EG and/or PG, Me-capped PEG and Na-dimethyl-5-sulfoisophthalate; and the anionic, especially sulfoaroyl, end-capped terephthalate esters of U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,896, Oct. 31, 1989 to Maldonado, Gosselink et al, the latter being typical of SRA's useful in both laundry and fabric conditioning products, an example being an ester composition made from m-sulfobenzoic acid monosodium salt, PG and DMT optionally but preferably further comprising added PEG, e.g., PEG 3400.</p><p>SRA's also include simple copolymeric blocks of ethylene terephthalate or propylene terephthalate with polyethylene oxide or polypropylene oxide terephthalate, see U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,230 to Hays, May 25, 1976 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,893,929 to Basadur, Jul. 8, 1975; cellulosic derivatives such as the hydroxyether cellulosic polymers available as METHOCEL from Dow; and the C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkylcelluloses and C.sub.4 hydroxyalkyl celluloses; see U.S. Pat. No. 4,000,093, Dec. 28, 1976 to Nicol, et al. Suitable SRA's characterised by poly(vinyl ester) hydrophobe segments include graft copolymers of poly(vinyl ester), e.g., C.sub.1 -C.sub.6 vinyl esters, preferably poly(vinyl acetate), grafted onto polyalkylene oxide backbones. See European Patent Application 0 219 048, published Apr. 22, 1987 by Kud, et al. Commercially available examples include SOKALAN SRA's such as SOKALAN HP-22, available from BASF, Germany. Other SRA's are polyesters with repeat units containing 10-15% by weight of ethylene terephthalate together with 90-80% by weight of polyoxyethylene terephthalate, derived from a polyoxyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 300-5,000. Commercial examples include ZELCON 5126 from Dupont and MILEASE T from ICI.</p><p>Another preferred SRA is an oligomer having empirical formula (CAP).sub.2 (EG/PG).sub.5 (T).sub.5 (SIP).sub.1 which comprises terephthaloyl (T), sulfoisophthaloyl (SIP), oxyethyleneoxy and oxy-1,2-propylene (EG/PG) units and which is preferably terminated with end-caps (CAP), preferably modified isethionates, as in an oligomer comprising one sulfoisophthaloyl unit, 5 terephthaloyl units, oxyethyleneoxy and oxy-1,2-propyleneoxy units in a defined ratio, preferably about 0.5:1 to about 10:1, and two end-cap units derived from sodium 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-ethanesulfonate. Said SRA preferably further comprises from 0.5% to 20%, by weight of the oligomer, of a crystallinity-reducing stabiliser, for example an anionic surfactant such as linear sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate or a member selected from xylene-, cumene-, and toluene- sulfonates or mixtures thereof, these stabilizers or modifiers being introduced into the synthesis pot, all as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,415,807, Gosselink, Pan, Kellett and Hall, issued May 16, 1995. Suitable monomers for the above SRA include Na 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-ethanesulfonate, DMT, Na- dimethyl 5-sulfoisophthalate, EG and PG.</p><p>Yet another group of preferred SRA's are oligomeric esters comprising: (1) a backbone comprising (a) at least one unit selected from the group consisting of dihydroxysulfonates, polyhydroxy sulfonates, a unit which is at least trifunctional whereby ester linkages are formed resulting in a branched oligomer backbone, and combinations thereof; (b) at least one unit which is a terephthaloyl moiety; and (c) at least one unsulfonated unit which is a 1,2-oxyalkyleneoxy moiety; and (2) one or more capping units selected from nonionic capping units, anionic capping units such as alkoxylated, preferably ethoxylated, isethionates, alkoxylated propanesulfonates, alkoxylated propanedisulfonates, alkoxylated phenolsulfonates, sulfoaroyl derivatives and mixtures thereof. Preferred of such esters are those of empirical formula:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->{(CAP)x(EG/PG)y'(DEG)y"(PEG)y'"(T)z(SIP)z'(SEG)q(B)m}</pre></p><p>wherein CAP, EG/PG, PEG, T and SIP are as defined hereinabove, (DEG) represents di(oxyethylene)oxy units; (SEG) represents units derived from the sulfoethyl ether of glycerin and related moiety units; (B) represents branching units which are at least trifunctional whereby ester linkages are formed resulting in a branched oligomer backbone; x is from about 1 to about 12; y' is from about 0.5 to about 25; y" is from 0 to about 12; y'" is from 0 to about 10; y'+y"+y'" totals from about 0.5 to about 25; z is from about 1.5 to about 25; z' is from 0 to about 12; z+z' totals from about 1.5 to about 25; q is from about 0.05 to about 12; m is from about 0.01 to about 10; and x, y', y", y'", z, z', q and m represent the average number of moles of the corresponding units per mole of said ester and said ester has a molecular weight ranging from about 500 to about 5,000.</p><p>Preferred SEG and CAP monomers for the above esters include Na-2-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)ethanesulfonate ("SEG"), Na-2-{2-(2-hydroxyethoxy) ethoxy} ethanesulfonate ("SE3") and its homologs and mixtures thereof and the products of ethoxylating and sulfonating allyl alcohol. Preferred SRA esters in this class include the product of transesterifying and oligomerizing sodium 2-{2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy}ethanesulfonate and/or sodium 2-[2-{2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy}ethoxy]ethanesulfonate, DMT, sodium 2-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy) ethane sulfonate, EG, and PG using an appropriate Ti(IV) catalyst and can be designated as (CAP)2(T)5(EG/PG)1.4(SEG)2.5(B)0.13 wherein CAP is (Na+--O.sub.3 S[CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O]3.5)-- and B is a unit from glycerin and the mole ratio EG/PG is about 1.7:1 as measured by conventional gas chromatography after complete hydrolysis.</p><p>Additional classes of SRA's include (1) nonionic terephthalates using diisocyanate coupling agents to link up polymeric ester structures, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,201,824, Violland et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,240,918 Lagasse et al; (II) SRA's with carboxylate terminal groups made by adding trimellitic anhydride to known SRA's to convert terminal hydroxyl groups to trimellitate esters. With a proper selection of catalyst, the trimellitic anhydride forms linkages to the terminals of the polymer through an ester of the isolated carboxylic acid of trimellitic anhydride rather than by opening of the anhydride linkage. Either nonionic or anionic SRA's may be used as staring materials as long as they have hydroxyl terminal groups which may be esterified. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,525,524 Tung et al.; (III) anionic terephthalate-based SRA's of the urethane-linked variety, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,201,824, Violland et al; (IV) poly(vinyl caprolactam) and related co-polymers with monomers such as vinyl pyrrolidone and/or dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, including both nonionic and cationic polymers, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,681, Ruppert et al.; (V) graft copolymers, in addition to the SOKALAN types from BASF made, by grafting acrylic monomers on to sulfonated polyesters; these SRA's assertedly have soil release and anti-redeposition activity similar to known cellulose ethers: see EP 279,134 A, 1988, to Rhone-Poulenc Chemie; (VI) grafts of vinyl monomers such as acrylic acid and vinyl acetate on to proteins such as caseins, see EP 457,205 A to BASF (1991); (VII) polyester-polyamide SRA's prepared by condensing adipic acid, caprolactam, and polyethylene glycol, especially for treating polyamide fabrics, see Bevan et al, DE 2,335,044 to Unilever N. V., 1974. Other useful SRA's are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,240,918, 4,787,989, 4,525,524 and 4,877,896.</p><p>Clay Soil Removal/Anti-redeposition Agents--The compositions of the present invention can also optionally contain water-soluble ethoxylated amines having clay soil removal and antiredeposition properties. Granular detergent compositions which contain these compounds typically contain from about 0.01% to about 10.0% by weight of the water-soluble ethoxylates amines; liquid detergent compositions typically contain about 0.01% to about 5%.</p><p>The most preferred soil release and anti-redeposition agent is ethoxylated tetraethylenepentamine. Exemplary ethoxylated amines are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,597,898, VanderMeer, issued Jul. 1, 1986. Another group of preferred clay soil removal-antiredeposition agents are the cationic compounds disclosed in European Patent Application 111,965, Oh and Gosselink, published Jun. 27, 1984.

These materials are well known in the art.</p><p>Polymeric Dispersing Agents--Polymeric dispersing agents can advantageously be utilized at levels from about 0.1% to about 7%, by weight, in the compositions herein, especially in the presence of zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Suitable polymeric dispersing agents include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols, although others known in the art can also be used. It is believed, though it is not intended to be limited by theory, that polymeric dispersing agents enhance overall detergent builder performance, when used in combination with other builders (including lower molecular weight polycarboxylates) by crystal growth inhibition, particulate soil release peptization, and anti-redeposition.</p><p>Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein or monomeric segments, containing no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrene, ethylene, etc. is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight.</p><p>Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid. The average molecular weight of such polymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000 and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble polymers of this type are known materials. Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, in Diehl, U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,067, issued Mar. 7, 1967.</p><p>Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the dispersing/anti-redeposition agent. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid. The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 100,000, more preferably from about 5,000 to 75,000, most preferably from about 7,000 to 65,000. The ratio of acrylate to maleate segments in such copolymers will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid/maleic acid copolymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble acrylate/maleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published Dec. 15, 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published Sep. 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate. Still other useful dispersing agents include the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol terpolymers. Such materials are also disclosed in EP 193,360, including, for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.</p><p>Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal-antiredeposition agent. Typical molecular weight ranges for these purposes range from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 50,000, more preferably from about 1,500 to about 10,000.</p><p>Polyaspartate and polyglutamate dispersing agents may also be used, especially in conjunction with zeolite builders. Dispersing agents such as polyaspartate preferably have a molecular weight (avg.) of about 10,000.</p><p>Brightener--Any optical brighteners or other brightening or whitening agents known in the art can be incorporated at levels typically from about 0.01% to about 1.2%, by weight, into the detergent compositions herein. Commercial optical brighteners which may be useful in the present invention can be classified into subgroups, which include, but are not necessarily limited to, derivatives of stilbene, pyrazoline, coumarin, carboxylic acid, methinecyanines, dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxide, azoles, 5- and 6-membered-ring heterocycles, and other miscellaneous agents.

Zahradnik, Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1982).</p><p>Specific examples of optical brighteners which are useful in the present compositions are those identified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,790,856, issued to Wixon on Dec. 13, 1988. These brighteners include the PHORWHITE series of brighteners from Verona.

See also U.S. Pat. No. 3,646,015, issued Feb. 29, 1972 to Hamilton.</p><p>Dye Transfer Inhibiting Agents--The compositions of the present invention may also include one or more materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the cleaning process. Generally, such dye transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, manganese phthalocyanine, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof. If used, these agents typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 2%.</p><p>More specifically, the polyamine N-oxide polymers preferred for use herein contain units having the following structural formula: R--A.sub.x --P; wherein P is a polymerizable unit to which an N--O group can be attached or the N--O group can form part of the polymerizable unit or the N--O group can be attached to both units; A is one of the following structures: --NC(O)--, --C(O)O--, --S--, --O--, --N═; x is 0 or 1; and R is aliphatic, ethoxylated aliphatics, aromatics, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or any combination thereof to which the nitrogen of the N--O group can be attached or the N--O group is part of these groups. Preferred polyamine N-oxides are those wherein R is a heterocyclic group such as pyridine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, piperidine and derivatives thereof.</p><p>The N--O group can be represented by the following general structures: ##STR44## wherein R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3 are aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or combinations thereof; x, y and z are 0 or 1; and the nitrogen of the N--O group can be attached or form part of any of the aforementioned groups. The amine oxide unit of the polyamine N-oxides has a pKa&amp;lt;10, preferably pKa&amp;lt;7, more preferred pKa&amp;lt;6.</p><p>Any polymer backbone can be used as long as the amine oxide polymer formed is water-soluble and has dye transfer inhibiting properties. Examples of suitable polymeric backbones are polyvinyls, polyalkylenes, polyesters, polyethers, polyamide, polyimides, polyacrylates and mixtures thereof. These polymers include random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide. The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000. However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation. The polyamine oxides can be obtained in almost any degree of polymerization. Typically, the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferred 1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000. This preferred class of materials can be referred to as "PVNO".</p><p>The most preferred polyamine N-oxide useful in the detergent compositions herein is poly(4-vinylpyridine-N-oxide) which as an average molecular weight of about 50,000 and an amine to amine N-oxide ratio of about 1:4.</p><p>Copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole polymers (referred to as a class as "PVPVI") are also preferred for use herein. Preferably the PVPVI has an average molecular weight range from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 200,000, and most preferably from 10,000 to 20,000. (The average molecular weight range is determined by light scattering as described in Barth, et al., Chemical Analysis, Vol 113. "Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization", the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.) The PVPVI copolymers typically have a molar ratio of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyrrolidone from 1:1 to 0.2:1, more preferably from 0.8:1 to 0.3:1, most preferably from 0.6:1 to 0.4:1. These copolymers can be either linear or branched.</p><p>The present invention compositions also may employ a polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") having an average molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 400,000, preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000, and more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000. PVP's are known to persons skilled in the detergent field; see, for example, EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696, incorporated herein by reference. Compositions containing PVP can also contain polyethylene glycol ("PEG") having an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 10,000. Preferably, the ratio of PEG to PVP on a ppm basis delivered in wash solutions is from about 2:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1.</p><p>The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain from about 0.005% to 5% by weight of certain types of hydrophilic optical brighteners which also provide a dye transfer inhibition action. If used, the compositions herein will preferably comprise from about 0.01% to 1% by weight of such optical brighteners.</p><p>The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention are those having the structural formula: ##STR45## wherein R.sub.1 is selected from anilino, N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and NH-2-hydroxyethyl; R.sub.2 is selected from N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl, N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino, morphilino, chloro and amino; and M is a salt-forming cation such as sodium or potassium.</p><p>When in the above formula, R.sub.1 is anilino, R.sub.2 is N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4',-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid and disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal-UNPA-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation. Tinopal-UNPA-GX is the preferred hydrophilic optical brightener useful in the detergent compositions herein.</p><p>When in the above formula, R.sub.1 is anilino, R.sub.2 is N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-2-methylamino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal 5BM-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation.</p><p>When in the above formula, R.sub.1 is anilino, R.sub.2 is morphilino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-morphilino-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid, sodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal AMS-GX by Ciba Geigy Corporation.</p><p>The specific optical brightener species selected for use in the present invention provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in combination with the selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore described. The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e.g., PVNO and/or PVPVI) with such selected optical brighteners (e.g., Tinopal UNPA-GX, Tinopal 5BM-GX and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition in aqueous wash solutions than does either of these two detergent composition components when used alone. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such brighteners work this way because they have high affinity for fabrics in the wash solution and therefore deposit relatively quick on these fabrics. The extent to which brighteners deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the "exhaustion coefficient". The exhaustion coefficient is in general as the ratio of a) the brightener material deposited on fabric to b) the initial brightener concentration in the wash liquor. Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients are the most suitable for inhibiting dye transfer in the context of the present invention.</p><p>Of course, it will be appreciated that other, conventional optical brightener types of compounds can optionally be used in the present compositions to provide conventional fabric "brightness" benefits, rather than a true dye transfer inhibiting effect. Such usage is conventional and well-known to detergent formulations.</p><p>Chelating Agents--The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain one or more iron and/or manganese chelating agents. Such chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of amino carboxylates, amino phosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents and mixtures therein, all as hereinafter defined. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the benefit of these materials is due in part to their exceptional ability to remove iron and manganese ions from washing solutions by formation of soluble chelates.</p><p>Amino carboxylates useful as optional chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetracetates, N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetates, nitrilotriacetates, ethylenediamine tetraproprionates, triethylenetetraaminehexacetates, diethylenetriaminepentaacetates, and ethanoldiglycines, alkali metal, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts therein and mixtures therein.</p><p>Amino phosphonates are also suitable for use as chelating agents in the compositions of the invention when at lease low levels of total phosphorus are permitted in detergent compositions, and include ethylenediaminetetrakis (methylenephosphonates) as DEQUEST. Preferred, these amino phosphonates to not contain alkyl or alkenyl groups with more than about 6 carbon atoms.</p><p>Polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents are also useful in the compositions herein. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,812,044, issued May 21, 1974, to Connor et al. Preferred compounds of this type in acid form are dihydroxydisulfobenzenes such as 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-disulfobenzene.</p><p>A preferred biodegradable chelator for use herein is ethylenediamine disuccinate ("EDDS"), especially the [S,S] isomer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,233, Nov. 3, 1987, to Hartman and Perkins.</p><p>The compositions herein may also contain water-soluble methyl glycine diacetic acid (MGDA) salts (or acid form) as a chelant or co-builder useful with, for example, insoluble builders such as zeolites, layered silicates and the like.</p><p>If utilized, these chelating agents will generally comprise from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. More preferably, if utilized, the chelating agents will comprise from about 0.1% to about 3.0% by weight of such compositions.</p><p>Suds Suppressors--Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention. Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration cleaning process" as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 and in front-loading European-style washing machines.</p><p>A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds suppressors are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of suds suppressor of particular interest encompasses monocarboxylic fatty acid and soluble salts therein. See U.S. Pat. No. 2,954,347, issued Sep. 27, 1960 to Wayne St. John. The monocarboxylic fatty acids and salts thereof used as suds suppressor typically have hydrocarbyl chains of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium salts, and ammonium and alkanolammonium salts.</p><p>The detergent compositions herein may also contain non-surfactant suds suppressors. These include, for example: high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as paraffin, fatty acid esters (e.g., fatty acid triglycerides), fatty acid esters of monovalent alcohols, aliphatic C.sub.18 -C.sub.40 ketones (e.g., stearone), etc. Other suds inhibitors include N-alkylated amino triazines such as tri- to hexa-alkylmelamines or di- to tetra-alkyldiamine chlortriazines formed as products of cyanuric chloride with two or three moles of a primary or secondary amine containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, propylene oxide, and monostearyl phosphates such as monostearyl alcohol phosphate ester and monostearyl di-alkali metal (e.g., K, Na, and Li) phosphates and phosphate esters. The hydrocarbons such as paraffin and haloparaffin can be utilized in liquid form. The liquid hydrocarbons will be liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and will have a pour point in the range of about -40 less than about 110 utilize waxy hydrocarbons, preferably having a melting point below about 100 suppressor for detergent compositions. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al. The hydrocarbons, thus, include aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and heterocyclic saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons having from about 12 to about 70 carbon atoms. The term "paraffin," as used in this suds suppressor discussion, is intended to include mixtures of true paraffins and cyclic hydrocarbons.</p><p>Another preferred category of non-surfactant suds suppressors comprises silicone suds suppressors. This category includes the use of polyorganosiloxane oils, such as polydimethylsiloxane, dispersions or emulsions of polyorganosiloxane oils or resins, and combinations of polyorganosiloxane with silica particles wherein the polyorganosiloxane is chemisorbed or fused onto the silica. Silicone suds suppressors are well known in the art and are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al and European Patent Application No. 89307851.9, published Feb. 7, 1990, by Starch, M. S.</p><p>Other silicone suds suppressors are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,455,839 which relates to compositions and processes for defoaming aqueous solutions by incorporating therein small amounts of polydimethylsiloxane fluids.</p><p>Mixtures of silicone and silanated silica are described, for instance, in German Patent Application DOS 2,124,526. Silicone defoamers and suds controlling agents in granular detergent compositions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,933,672, Bartolotta et al, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,392, Baginski et al, issued Mar. 24, 1987.</p><p>An exemplary silicone based suds suppressor for use herein is a suds suppressing amount of a suds controlling agent consisting essentially of:</p><p>(i) polydimethylsiloxane fluid having a viscosity of from about 20 cs. to about 1,500 cs. at 25</p><p>(ii) from about 5 to about 50 parts per 100 parts by weight of (i) of siloxane resin composed of (CH.sub.3).sub.3 SiO.sub.1/2 units of SiO.sub.2 units in a ratio of from (CH.sub.3).sub.3 SiO.sub.1/2 units and to SiO.sub.2 units of from about 0.6:1 to about 1.2:1; and</p><p>(iii) from about 1 to about 20 parts per 100 parts by weight of (i) of a solid silica gel.</p><p>In the preferred silicone suds suppressor used herein, the solvent for a continuous phase is made up of certain polyethylene glycols or polyethylene-polypropylene glycol copolymers or mixtures thereof (preferred), or polypropylene glycol. The primary silicone suds suppressor is branched/crosslinked and preferably not linear.</p><p>To illustrate this point further, typical liquid laundry detergent compositions with controlled suds will optionally comprise from about 0.001 to about 1, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.7, most preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5, weight % of said silicone uds suppressor, which comprises (1) a nonaqueous emulsion of a primary antifoam agent which is a mixture of (a) a polyorganosiloxane, (b) a resinous siloxane or a silicone resin-producing silicone compound, (c) a finely divided filler material, and (d) a catalyst to promote the reaction of mixture components (a), (b) and (c), to form silanolates; (2) at least one nonionic silicone surfactant; and (3) polyethylene glycol or a copolymer of polyethylene-polypropylene glycol having a solubility in water at room temperature of more than about 2 weight %; and without polypropylene glycol. Similar amounts can be used in granular compositions, gels, etc. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,978,471, Starch, issued Dec. 18, 1990, and 4,983,316, Starch, issued Jan. 8, 1991, 5,288,431, Huber et al., issued Feb. 22, 1994, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,639,489 and 4,749,740, Aizawa et al at column 1, line 46 through column 4, line 35.</p><p>The silicone suds suppressor herein preferably comprises polyethylene glycol and a copolymer of polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol, all having an average molecular weight of less than about 1,000, preferably between about 100 and 800. The polyethylene glycol and polyethylene/polypropylene copolymers herein have a solubility in water at room temperature of more than about 2 weight %, preferably more than about 5 weight %.</p><p>The preferred solvent herein is polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of less than about 1,000, more preferably between about 100 and 800, most preferably between 200 and 400, and a copolymer of polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol, preferably PPG 200/PEG 300. Preferred is a weight ratio of between about 1:1 and 1:10, most preferably between 1:3 and 1:6, of polyethylene glycol:copolymer of polyethylene-polypropylene glycol.</p><p>The preferred silicone suds suppressors used herein do not contain polypropylene glycol, particularly of 4,000 molecular weight. They also preferably do not contain block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, like PLURONIC L101.</p><p>Other suds suppressors useful herein comprise the secondary alcohols (e.g., 2-alkyl alkanols) and mixtures of such alcohols with silicone oils, such as the silicones disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,798,679, 4,075,118 and EP 150,872. The secondary alcohols include the C.sub.6 -C.sub.16 alkyl alcohols having a C.sub.1 -C.sub.16 chain. A preferred alcohol is 2-butyl octanol, which is available from Condea under the trademark ISOFOL 12. Mixtures of secondary alcohols are available under the trademark ISALCHEM 123 from Enichem. Mixed suds suppressors typically comprise mixtures of alcohol+silicone at a weight ratio of 1:5 to 5:1.</p><p>For any detergent compositions to be used in automatic laundry washing machines, suds should not form to the extent that they overflow the washing machine. Suds suppressors, when utilized, are preferably present in a "suds suppressing amount. By "suds suppressing amount" is meant that the formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will sufficiently control the suds to result in a low-sudsing laundry detergent for use in automatic laundry washing machines.</p><p>The compositions herein will generally comprise from 0% to about 10% of suds suppressor. When utilized as suds suppressors, monocarboxylic fatty acids, and salts therein, will be present typically in amounts up to about 5%, by weight, of the detergent composition. Preferably, from about 0.5% to about 3% of fatty monocarboxylate suds suppressor is utilized. Silicone suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts up to about 2.0%, by weight, of the detergent composition, although higher amounts may be used. This upper limit is practical in nature, due primarily to concern with keeping costs minimized and effectiveness of lower amounts for effectively controlling sudsing. Preferably from about 0.01% to about 1% of silicone suds suppressor is used, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 0.5%. As used herein, these weight percentage values include any silica that may be utilized in combination with polyorganosiloxane, as well as any adjunct materials that may be utilized. Monostearyl phosphate suds suppressors are generally utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.01% to about 5.0%, although higher levels can be used. The alcohol suds suppressors are typically used at 0.2%-3% by weight of the finished compositions.</p><p>Alkoxylated Polycarboxylates--Alkoxylated polycarboxylates such as those prepared from polyacrylates are useful herein to provide additional grease removal performance. Such materials are described in WO 91/08281 and PCT 90/01815 at p. 4 et seq., incorporated herein by reference. Chemically, these materials comprise polyacrylates having one ethoxy side-chain per every 7-8 acrylate units. The side-chains are of the formula --(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.m (CH.sub.2).sub.n CH.sub.3 wherein m is 2-3 and n is 6-12. The side-chains are ester-linked to the polyacrylate "backbone" to provide a "comb" polymer type structure. The molecular weight can vary, but is typically in the range of about 2000 to about 50,000. Such alkoxylated polycarboxylates can comprise from about 0.05% to about 10%, by weight, of the compositions herein.</p><p>Fabric Softeners--Various through-the-wash fabric softeners, especially the impalpable smectite clays of U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,647, Storm and Nirschl, issued Dec. 13, 1977, as well as other softener clays known in the art, can optionally be used typically at levels of from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight in the present compositions to provide fabric softener benefits concurrently with fabric cleaning. Clay softeners can be used in combination with amine and cationic softeners as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,375,416, Crisp et al, Mar. 1, 1983 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,291,071, Harris et al, issued Sep. 22, 1981.</p><p>Perfumes--Perfumes and perfumery ingredients useful in the present compositions and processes comprise a wide variety of natural and synthetic chemical ingredients, including, but not limited to, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and the like. Also included are various natural extracts and essences which can comprise complex mixtures of ingredients, such as orange oil, lemon oil, rose extract, lavender, musk, patchouli, balsamic essence, sandalwood oil, pine oil, cedar, and the like. Finished perfumes can comprise extremely complex mixtures of such ingredients. Finished perfumes typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 2%, by weight, of the detergent compositions herein, and individual perfumery ingredients can comprise from about 0.0001% to about 90% of a finished perfume composition.</p><p>Several perfume formulations are set forth in Example XXI, hereinafter. Non-limiting examples of perfume ingredients useful herein include: 7-acetyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-1,1,6,7-tetramethyl naphthalene; ionone methyl; ionone gamma methyl; methyl cedrylone; methyl dihydrojasmonate; methyl 1,6,10-trimethyl-2,5,9-cyclododecatrien-1-yl ketone; 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl tetralin; 4-acetyl-6-tert-butyl-1,1-dimethyl indane; para-hydroxy-phenyl-butanone; benzophenone; methyl beta-naphthyl ketone; 6-acetyl-1,1,2,3,3,5-hexamethyl indane; 5-acetyl-3-isopropyl-1,1,2,6-tetramethyl indane; 1-dodecanal, 4-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde; 7-hydroxy-3,7-dimethyl ocatanal; 10-undecen-1-al; iso-hexenyl cyclohexyl carboxaldehyde; formyl tricyclodecane; condensation products of hydroxycitronellal and methyl anthranilate, condensation products of hydroxycitronellal and indol, condensation products of phenyl acetaldehyde and indol; 2-methyl-3-(para-tert-butylphenyl)-propionaldehyde; ethyl vanillin; heliotropin; hexyl cinnamic aldehyde; amyl cinnamic aldehyde; 2-methyl-2-(para-iso-propylphenyl)-propionaldehyde; coumarin; decalactone gamma; cyclopentadecanolide; 16-hydroxy-9-hexadecenoic acid lactone; 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-gamma-2-benzopyrane; beta-naphthol methyl ether; ambroxane; dodecahydro-3a,6,6,9a-tetra-methylnaphtho[2,1b]furan; cedrol, 5-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl)-3-methylpentan-2-ol; 2-ethyl-4-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-1-yl)-2-buten-1-ol; caryophyllene alcohol; tricyclodecenyl propionate; tricyclodecenyl acetate; benzyl salicylate; cedryl acetate; and para-(tert-butyl) cyclohexyl acetate.</p><p>Particularly preferred perfume materials are those that provide the largest odor improvements in finished product compositions containing cellulases. These perfumes include but are not limited to: hexyl cinnamic aldehyde; 2-methyl-3-(para-tert-butylphenyl)-propionaldehyde; 7-acetyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-1,1,6,7-tetramethyl naphthalene; benzyl salicylate; 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl tetralin; para-tert-butyl cyclohexyl acetate; methyl dihydro jasmonate; beta-napthol methyl ether; methyl beta-naphthyl ketone; 2-methyl-2-(para-iso-propylphenyl)-propionaldehyde; 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-cyclopenta-gamma-2-benzopyrane; dodecahydro-3a,6,6,9a-tetramethylnaphtho[2,1b]furan; anisaldehyde; coumarin; cedrol; vanillin; cyclopentadecanolide; tricyclodecenyl acetate; and tricyclodecenyl propionate.</p><p>Other perfume materials include essential oils, resinoids, and resins from a variety of sources including, but not limited to: Peru balsam, Olibanum resinoid, styrax, labdanum resin, nutmeg, cassia oil, benzoin resin, coriander and lavandin. Still other perfume chemicals include phenyl ethyl alcohol, terpineol, linalool, linalyl acetate, geraniol, nerol, 2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-cyclohexanol acetate, benzyl acetate, and eugenol. Carriers such as diethylphthalate can be used in the finished perfume compositions.</p><p>Other Ingredients--A wide variety of other ingredients useful in detergent compositions can be included in the compositions herein, including other active ingredients, carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, solvents for liquid formulations, solid fillers for bar compositions, etc. If high sudsing is desired, suds boosters such as the C.sub.10 -C.sub.16 alkanolamides can be incorporated into the compositions, typically at 1%-10% levels. The C.sub.10 -C.sub.14 monoethanol and diethanol amides illustrate a typical class of such suds boosters. Use of such suds boosters with high sudsing adjunct surfactants such as the amine oxides, betaines and sultaines noted above is also advantageous. If desired, water-soluble magnesium and/or calcium salts such as MgCl.sub.2, MgSO.sub.4, CaCl.sub.2, CaSO.sub.4 and the like, can be added at levels of, typically, 0.1%-2%, to provide additional suds and to enhance grease removal performance.</p><p>Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic substrate, then coating said substrate with a hydrophobic coating. Preferably, the detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous substrate. In use, the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function.</p><p>To illustrate this technique in more detail, a porous hydrophobic silica (trademark SIPERNAT D10, DeGussa) is admixed with a proteolytic enzyme solution containing 3%-5% of C.sub.13 -C.sub.15 ethoxylated alcohol (EO 7) nonionic surfactant. Typically, the enzyme/surfactant solution is 2.5 X the weight of silica. The resulting powder is dispersed with stirring in silicone oil (various silicone oil viscosities in the range of 500-12,500 can be used). The resulting silicone oil dispersion is emulsified or otherwise added to the final detergent matrix. By this means, ingredients such as the aforementioned enzymes, bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, photoactivators, dyes, fluorescers, fabric conditioners and hydrolyzable surfactants can be "protected" for use in detergents, including liquid laundry detergent compositions.</p><p>Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.</p><p>The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 10.5. Liquid dishwashing product formulations preferably have a pH between about 6.8 and about 9 Laundry products are typically at pH 9-11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art.</p><p>Form of the Compositions</p><p>The compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including granular, tablet, bar and liquid forms. The compositions are particularly the so-called concentrated granular detergent compositions adapted to be added to a washing machine by means of a dispensing device placed in the machine drum with the soiled fabric load.</p><p>The mean particle size of the components of granular compositions in accordance with the invention should preferably be such that no more that 5% of particles are greater than 1.7 mm in diameter and not more than 5% of particles are less than 0.15 mm in diameter.</p><p>The term mean particle size as defined herein is calculated by sieving a sample of the composition into a number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of Tyler sieves. The weight fractions thereby obtained are plotted against the aperture size of the sieves. The mean particle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.</p><p>The bulk density of granular detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention typically have a bulk density of at least 600 g/liter, more preferably from 650 g/liter to 1200 g/liter. Bulk density is measured by means of a simple funnel and cup device consisting of a conical funnel moulded rigidly on a base and provided with a flap valve at its lower extremity to allow the contents of the funnel to be emptied into an axially aligned cylindrical cup disposed below the funnel. The funnel is 130 mm high and has internal diameters of 130 mm and 40 mm at its respective upper and lower extremities. It is mounted so that the lower extremity is 140 mm above the upper surface of the base. The cup has an overall height of 90 mm, an internal height of 87 mm and an internal diameter of 84 mm. Its nominal volume is 500 ml.</p><p>To carry out a measurement, the funnel is filled with powder by hand pouring, the flap valve is opened and powder allowed to overfill the cup. The filled cup is removed from the frame and excess powder removed from the cup by passing a straight edged implement eg; a knife, across its upper edge. The filled cup is then weighed and the value obtained for the weight of powder doubled to provide a bulk density in g/liter. Replicate measurements are made as required.</p><p>Mid-Chain Branched Surfactant Agglomerate Particles</p><p>The mid-chain branched surfactant system herein is preferably present in granular compositions in the form of mid-chain branched surfactant agglomerate particles, which may take the form of flakes, prills, marumes, noodles, ribbons, but preferably take the form of granules. The most preferred way to process the particles is by agglomerating powders (e.g. aluminosilicate, carbonate) with high active mid-chain branched surfactant pastes and to control the particle size of the resultant agglomerates within specified limits. Such a process involves mixing an effective amount of powder with a high active mid-chain branched surfactant paste in one or more agglomerators such as a pan agglomerator, a Z-blade mixer or more preferably an in-line mixer such as those manufactured by Schugi (Holland) BV, 29 Chroomstraat 8211 AS, Lelystad, Netherlands, and Gebruder Lodige Maschinenbau GmbH, D-4790 Paderborn 1, Elsenerstrasse 7-9, Postfach 2050, Germany. Most preferably a high shear mixer is used, such as a Lodige CB (Trade Name).</p><p>A high active mid-chain branched surfactant paste comprising from 50% by weight to 95% by weight, preferably 70% by weight to 85% by weight of mid-chain branched surfactant is typically used. The paste may be pumped into the agglomerator at a temperature high enough to maintain a pumpable viscosity, but low enough to avoid degradation of the anionic surfactants used. An operating temperature of the paste of 50 C. is typical.</p><p>Laundry Washing Method</p><p>Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundry detergent composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is meant from 40 g to 300 g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 liters, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods.</p><p>As noted, the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactants are used herein in detergent compositions, preferably in combination with other detersive surfactants, at levels which are effective for achieving at least a directional improvement in cleaning performance. In the context of a fabric laundry composition, such "usage levels" can vary depending not only on the type and severity of the soils and stains, but also on the wash water temperature, the volume of wash water and the type of washing machine.</p><p>For example, in a top-loading, vertical axis U.S.-type automatic washing machine using about 45 to 83 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 14 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 10 from about 2 ppm to about 625 ppm, preferably from about 2 ppm to about 550 ppm, more preferably from about 10 ppm to about 235 ppm, of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant in the wash liquor. On the basis of usage rates of from about 50 ml to about 150 ml per wash load, this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 40%, preferably about 0.1% to about 35%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%, for a heavy-duty liquid laundry detergent. On the basis of usage rates of from about 30 g to about 950 g per wash load, for dense ("compact") granular laundry detergents (density above about 650 g/l) this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 35%, and more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%. On the basis of usage rates of from about 80 g to about 100 g per load for spray-dried granules (i.e., "fluffy"; density below about 650 g/l), this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.07% to about 35%, preferably from about 0.07 to about 25%, and more preferably from about 0.35% to about 11%.</p><p>For example, in a front-loading, horizontal-axis European-type automatic washing machine using about 8 to 15 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 60 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 30 from about 3 ppm to about 14,000 ppm, preferably from about 3 ppm to about 10,000 ppm, more preferably from about 15 ppm to about 4200 ppm, of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant in the wash liquor. On the basis of usage rates of from about 45 ml to about 270 ml per wash load, this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably about 0.1% to about 35%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%, for a heavy-duty liquid laundry detergent. On the basis of usage rates of from about 40 g to about 210 g per wash load, for dense ("compact") granular laundry detergents (density above about 650 g/l) this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.12% to about 53%, preferably from about 0.12% to about 46%, and more preferably from about 0.6% to about 20%. On the basis of usage rates of from about 140 g to about 400 g per load for spray-dried granules (i.e., "fluffy"; density below about 650 g/l), this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.03% to about 34%, preferably from about 0.03% to about 24%, and more preferably from about 0.15% to about 10%.</p><p>For example, in a top-loading, vertical-axis Japanese-type automatic washing machine using about 26 to 52 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 8 to about 15 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 5 about 0.67 ppm to about 270 ppm, preferably from about 0.67 ppm to about 236 ppm, more preferably from about 3.4 ppm to about 100 ppm, of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant in the wash liquor. On the basis of usage rates of from about 20 ml to about 30 ml per wash load, this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 40%, preferably about 0.1% to about 35%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%, for a heavy-duty liquid laundry detergent. On the basis of usage rates of from about 18 g to about 35 g per wash load, for dense ("compact") granular laundry detergents (density above about 650 g/l) this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 35%, and more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%. On the basis of usage rates of from about 30 g to about 40 g per load for spray-dried granules (i.e., "fluffy"; density below about 650 g/l), this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant of from about 0.06% to about 44%, preferably from about 0.06% to about 30%, and more preferably from about 0.3% to about 13%.</p><p>As can be seen from the foregoing, the amount of mid-chain branched surfactant surfactant used in a machine-wash laundering context can vary, depending on the habits and practices of the user, the type of washing machine, and the like. In this context, however, one heretofore unappreciated advantage of the mid-chain branched surfactant surfactants is their ability to provide at least directional improvements in performance over a spectrum of soils and stains even when used at relatively low levels with respect to the other surfactants (generally anionics or anionic/nonionic mixtures) in the finished compositions.</p><p>In a preferred use aspect a dispensing device is employed in the washing method. The dispensing device is charged with the detergent product, and is used to introduce the product directly into the drum of the washing machine before the commencement of the wash cycle. Its volume capacity should be such as to be able to contain sufficient detergent product as would normally be used in the washing method.</p><p>Once the washing machine has been loaded with laundry the dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drum. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine water is introduced into the drum and the drum periodically rotates. The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product during the wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.</p><p>To allow for release of the detergent product during the wash the device may possess a number of openings through which the product may pass. Alternatively, the device may be made of a material which is permeable to liquid but impermeable to the solid product, which will allow release of dissolved product. Preferably, the detergent product will be rapidly released at the start of the wash cycle thereby providing transient localised high concentrations of product in the drum of the washing machine at this stage of the wash cycle.</p><p>Preferred dispensing devices are reusable and are designed in such a way that container integrity is maintained in both the dry state and during the wash cycle. Especially preferred dispensing devices for use with the composition of the invention have been described in the following patents; GB-B-2, 157, 717, GB-B-2, 157, 718, EP-A-0201376, EP-A-0288345 and EP-A-0288346. An article by J. Bland published in Manufacturing Chemist, November 1989, pages 41-46 also describes especially preferred dispensing devices for use with granular laundry products which are of a type commonly know as the "granulette". Another preferred dispensing device for use with the compositions of this invention is disclosed in PCT Patent Application No. WO94/11562.</p><p>Especially preferred dispensing devices are disclosed in European Patent Application Publication Nos. 0343069 &amp; 0343070. The latter Application discloses a device comprising a flexible sheath in the form of a bag extending from a support ring defining an orifice, the orifice being adapted to admit to the bag sufficient product for one washing cycle in a washing process. A portion of the washing medium flows through the orifice into the bag, dissolves the product, and the solution then passes outwardly through the orifice into the washing medium. The support ring is provided with a masking arrangemnt to prevent egress of wetted, undissolved, product, this arrangement typically comprising radially extending walls extending from a central boss in a spoked wheel configuration, or a similar structure in which the walls have a helical form.</p><p>Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a bag or pouch. The bag may be of fibrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Patent Application No.0018678. Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in aqueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500, 0011501, 0011502, and 0011968. A convenient form of water frangible closure comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and sealing one edge of a pouch formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as polyethylene or polypropylene.</p><p>Machine Dishwashing Method</p><p>Any suitable methods for machine washing or cleaning soiled tableware, particularly soiled silverware are envisaged.</p><p>A preferred machine dishwashing method comprises treating soiled articles selected from crockery, glassware, hollowware, silverware and cutlery and mixtures thereof, with an aqueous liquid having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine dishwashing composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the machine dishwashing composition it is meant from 8 g to 60 g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 3 to 10 liters, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine dishwashing methods.</p><p>Packaging for the Compositions</p><p>Commercially marketed executions of the bleaching compositions can be packaged in any suitable container including those constructed from paper, cardboard, plastic materials and any suitable laminates. A preferred packaging execution is described in European Application No. 94921505.7.</p><p>In the following Examples, the abbreviations for the various ingredients used for the compositions have the following meanings.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________LAS      Sodium linear C.sub.12 alkyl benzene sulfonateMBAS.sub.x    Mid-chain branched primary alkyl (average total    carbons = x) sulfateMBAE.sub.x S.sub.z    Mid-chain branched primary alkyl (average total    carbons = z) ethoxylate (average EO = x) sulfate,    sodium saltMBAE.sub.x    Mid-chain branched primary alkyl (average total    carbons = x) ethoxylate (average EO = 8)C45AS    Sodium C.sub.14 -C.sub.15 linear alkyl sulfateCxyEzS   Sodium C.sub.1x -C.sub.1y branched alkyl sulfate    condensed with z moles of ethylene oxideCxyEz    A C.sub.1z-1y branched primary alcohol condensed    with an average of z moles of ethylene oxideQAS      R.sub.2.N.sup.+ (CH.sub.3).sub.2 (C.sub.2 H.sub.4 OH) with    R.sub.2 = C.sub.12 -C.sub.14TFAA     C.sub.16 -C.sub.18 alkyl N-methyl glucamideSTPP     Anhydrous sodium tripolyphosphateZeolite A    Hydrated Sodium Aluminosilicate of formula    Na.sub.12 (A10.sub.2 SiO.sub.2).sub.12.27H.sub.2 O having a    primary    particle size in the range from 0.1 to 10    micrometersNaSKS-6  Crystalline layered silicate of formula    δ-Na.sub.2 Si.sub.2 O.sub.5Carbonate    Anhydrous sodium carbonate with a particle size    between 200 μm and 900 μmBicarbonate    Anhydrous sodium bicarbonate with a particle size    distribution between 400 μm and 1200 μmSilicate Amorphous Sodium Silicate (SiO.sub.2 :Na.sub.2 O; 2.0    ratio)Sodium sulfate    Anhydrous sodium sulfateMA/AA    Copolymer of 1:4 maleic/acrylic acid, average    molecular weight about 70,000.CMC      Sodium carboxymethyl celluloseProtease Proteolytic enzyme of activity 4KNPU/g sold by    NOVO Industries A/S under the tradename    SavinaseCellulase    Cellulytic enzyme of activity 1000 CEVU/g sold    by NOVO Industries A/S under the tradename    CarezymeAmylase  Amylolytic enzyme of activity 60KNU/g sold by    NOVO Industries A/S under the tradename    Termamyl 60TLipase   Lipolytic enzyme of activity 100kLU/g sold by    NOVO Industries A/S under the tradename    LipolasePB4      Sodium perborate tetrahydrate of nominal formula    NaBO.sub.2.3H.sub.2 O.H.sub.2 O.sub.2PB1      Anhydrous sodium perborate bleach of    nominal formula NaBO.sub.2.H.sub.2 O.sub.2Percarbonate    Sodium Percarbonate of nominal formula    2Na.sub.2 CO.sub.3.3H.sub.2 O.sub.2NaDCC    Sodium dichloroisocyanurateNOBS     Nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate in the form of the    sodium salt.TAED     TetraacetylethylenediamineDTPMP    Diethylene triamine penta(methylene phosphonate),    marketed by Monsanto under the Trade name Dequest    2060Photoactivated    Sulfonated Zinc Phthlocyanine encapsulated inbleach   dextrin soluble polymerBrightener 1    Disodium 4,4'-bis(2-sulphostyryl)biphenylBrightener 2    Disodium 4,4'-bis(4-anilino-6-morpholino-1.3.5-    triazin-2-yl)amino) stilbene-2:2'-disulfonate.HEDP     1,1-hydroxyethane diphosphonic acidSRP 1    Sulfobenzoyl end capped esters with oxyethylene    oxy and terephtaloyl backboneSilicone Polydimethylsiloxane foam controller with siloxane-antifoam:    oxyalkylene copolymer as dispersing agent with a ratio    of said foam controller to said dispersing agent of 10:1    to 100:1.DTPA     Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid______________________________________</pre></p><p>In the following Examples all levels are quoted as % by weight of the composition.

laundering, which comprise a non-aqueous carrier medium can be conducted in the manner disclosed in more detail hereinafter. In an alternate mode, such non-aqueous compositions can be prepared according to the disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,753,570; 4,767,558; 4,772,413; 4,889,652; 4,892,673; GB-A-2,158,838; GB-A-2,195,125; GB-A-2,195,649; U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,462; U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,233; EP-A-225,654 (Jun. 16, 1987); EP-A-510,762 (Oct. 28, 1992); EP-A-540,089 (May 5, 1993); EP-A-540,090 (May 5, 1993); U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,820; EP-A-565,017 (Oct. 13, 1993); EP-A-030,096 (Jun. 10, 1981), incorporated herein by reference. Such compositions can contain various particulate detersive ingredients (including the bleaching agents, as disclosed hereinabove) stably suspended therein. Such non-aqueous compositions thus comprise a LIQUID PHASE and, optionally but preferably, a SOLID PHASE, all as described in more detail hereinafter and in the cited references. The mid-chain branched surfactant is incorporated in the compositions at the levels and in the manner described hereinabove for the manufacture of other laundry detergent compositions.</p><heading>Liquid Phase</heading><p>The liquid phase will generally comprise from about 35% to 99% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. More preferably, the liquid phase will comprise from about 50% to 95% by weight of the compositions. Most preferably, the liquid phase will comprise from about 45% to 75% by weight of the compositions herein. The liquid phase of the detergent compositions herein essentially contains relatively high concentrations of a certain type anionic surfactant combined with a certain type of nonaqueous, liquid diluent.</p><p>(A) Essential Anionic Surfactant</p><p>The anionic surfactant essentially utilized as an essential component of the nonaqueous liquid phase is one selected from the alkali metal salts of alkylbenzene sulfonic acids in which the alkyl group contains from about 10 to 16 carbon atoms, in straight chain or branched chain configuration. (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,220,099 and 2,477,383, incorporated herein by reference). Especially preferred are the sodium and potassium linear straight chain alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) in which the average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is from about 11 to 14. Sodum C.sub.11 -C.sub.14 LAS is especially preferred.</p><p>The alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant will be dissolved in the nonaqueous liquid diluent which makes up the second essential component of the nonaqueous phase. To form the structured liquid phase required for suitable phase stability and acceptable rheology, the alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant is generally present to the extent of from about 30% to 65% by weight of the liquid phase. More preferably, the alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant will comprise from about 35% to 50% by weight of the nonaqueous liquid phase of the compositions herein. Utilization of this anionic surfactant in these concentrations corresponds to an anionic surfactant concentration in the total composition of from about 15% to 60% by weight, more preferably from about 20% to 40% by weight, of the composition.</p><p>(B) Nonaqueous Liquid Diluent</p><p>To form the liquid phase of the detergent compositions, the hereinbefore described alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant is combined with a nonaqueous liquid diluent which contains two essential components. These two components are a liquid alcohol alkoxylate material and a nonaqueous, low-polarity organic solvent.</p><p>i) Alcohol Alkoxylates</p><p>One essential component of the liquid diluent used to form the compositions herein comprises an alkoxylated fatty alcohol material. Such materials are themselves also nonionic surfactants. Such materials correspond to the general formula:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->R.sup.1 (C.sub.m H.sub.2m O).sub.n OH</pre></p><p>wherein R.sup.1 is a C.sub.8 -C.sub.16 alkyl group, m is from 2 to 4, and n ranges from about 2 to 12. Preferably R.sup.1 is an alkyl group, which may be primary or secondary, that contains from about 9 to 15 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 10 to 14 carbon atoms. Preferably also the alkoxylated fatty alcohols will be ethoxylated materials that contain from about 2 to 12 ethylene oxide moieties per molecule, more preferably from about 3 to 10 ethylene oxide moieties per molecule.</p><p>The alkoxylated fatty alcohol component of the liquid diluent will frequently have a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) which ranges from about 3 to 17. More preferably, the HLB of this material will range from about 6 to 15, most preferably from about 8 to 15.</p><p>Examples of fatty alcohol alkoxylates useful as one of the essential components of the nonaqueous liquid diluent in the compositions herein will include those which are made from alcohols of 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain about 7 moles of ethylene oxide. Such materials have been commercially marketed under the trade names Neodol 25-7 and Neodol 23-6.5 by Shell Chemical Company. Other useful Neodols include Neodol 1-5, an ethoxylated fatty alcohol averaging 11 carbon atoms in its alkyl chain with about 5 moles of ethylene oxide; Neodol 23-9, an ethoxylated primary C.sub.12 -C.sub.13 alcohol having about 9 moles of ethylene oxide and Neodol 91-10, an ethoxylated C.sub.9 -C.sub.11 primary alcohol having about 10 moles of ethylene oxide. Alcohol ethoxylates of this type have also been marketed by Shell Chemical Company under the Dobanol tradename. Dobanol 91-5 is an ethoxylated C.sub.9 -C.sub.11 fatty alcohol with an average of 5 moles ethylene oxide and Dobanol 25-7 is an ethoxylated C.sub.12 -C.sub.15 fatty alcohol with an average of 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of fatty alcohol.</p><p>Other examples of suitable ethoxylated alcohols include Tergitol 15-S-7 and Tergitol 15-S-9 both of which are linear secondary alcohol ethoxylates that have been commercially marketed by Union Carbide Corporation. The former is a mixed ethoxylation product of C.sub.11 to C.sub.15 linear secondary alkanol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide and the latter is a similar product but with 9 moles of ethylene oxide being reacted.</p><p>Other types of alcohol ethoxylates useful in the present compositions are higher molecular weight nonionics, such as Neodol 45-11, which are similar ethylene oxide condensation products of higher fatty alcohols, with the higher fatty alcohol being of 14-15 carbon atoms and the number of ethylene oxide groups per mole being about 11. Such products have also been commercially marketed by Shell Chemical Company.</p><p>The alcohol alkoxylate component which is essentially utilized as part of the liquid diluent in the nonaqueous compositions herein will generally be present to the extent of from about 1% to 60% of the liquid phase composition. More preferably, the alcohol alkoxylate component will comprise about 5% to 40% of the liquid phase. Most preferably, the essentially utilized alcohol alkoxylate component will comprise from about 5% to 30% of the detergent composition liquid phase. Utilization of alcohol alkoxylate in these concentrations in the liquid phase corresponds to an alcohol alkoxylate concentration in the total composition of from about 1% to 60% by weight, more preferably from about 2% to 40% by weight, and most preferably from about 5% to 25% by weight, of the composition.</p><p>ii) Nonaqueous Low-Polarity Organic Solvent</p><p>A second essential component of the liquid diluent which forms part of the liquid phase of the detergent compositions herein comprises nonaqueous, low-polarity organic solvent(s). The term "solvent" is used herein to connote the non-surface active carrier or diluent portion of the liquid phase of the composition. While some of the essential and/or optional components of the compositions herein may actually dissolve in the "solvent"-containing liquid phase, other components will be present as particulate material dispersed within the "solvent"-containing liquid phase. Thus the term "solvent" is not meant to require that the solvent material be capable of actually dissolving all of the detergent composition components added thereto.</p><p>The nonaqueous organic materials which are employed as solvents herein are those which are liquids of low polarity. For purposes of this invention, "low-polarity" liquids are those which have little, if any, tendency to dissolve one of the preferred types of particulate material used in the compositions herein, i.e., the peroxygen bleaching agents, sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate. Thus relatively polar solvents such as ethanol should not be utilized. Suitable types of low-polarity solvents useful in the nonaqueous liquid detergent compositions herein do include non-vicinal C.sub.4 -C.sub.8 alkylene glycols, alkylene glycol mono lower alkyl ethers, lower molecular weight polyethylene glycols, lower molecular weight methyl esters and amides, and the like.</p><p>A preferred type of nonaqueous, low-polarity solvent for use in the compositions herein comprises the non-vicinal C.sub.4 -C.sub.8 branched or straight chain alkylene glycols. Materials of this type include hexylene glycol (4-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), 1,6-hexanediol, 1,3-butylene glycol and 1,4-butylene glycol. Hexylene glycol is the most preferred.</p><p>Another preferred type of nonaqueous, low-polarity solvent for use herein comprises the mono-, di-, tri-, or tetra- C.sub.2 -C.sub.3 alkylene glycol mono C.sub.2 -C.sub.6 alkyl ethers. The specific examples of such compounds include diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monobutyl ether, dipropylene glycol monoethyl ether, and dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether. Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether and dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether are especially preferred. Compounds of the type have been commercially marketed under the tradenames Dowanol, Carbitol, and Cellosolve.</p><p>Another preferred type of nonaqueous, low-polarity organic solvent useful herein comprises the lower molecular weight polyethylene glycols (PEGs). Such materials are those having molecular weights of at least about 150. PEGs of molecular weight ranging from about 200 to 600 are most preferred.</p><p>Yet another preferred type of non-polar, nonaqueous solvent comprises lower molecular weight methyl esters. Such materials are those of the general formula: R.sup.1 --C(O)--OCH.sub.3 wherein R.sup.1 ranges from 1 to about 18. Examples of suitable lower molecular weight methyl esters include methyl acetate, methyl propionate, methyl octanoate, and methyl dodecanoate.</p><p>The nonaqueous, low-polarity organic solvent(s) employed should, of course, be compatible and non-reactive with other composition components, e.g., bleach and/or activators, used in the liquid detergent compositions herein. Such a solvent component will generally be utilized in an amount of from about 1% to 70% by weight of the liquid phase. More preferably, the nonaqueous, low-polarity organic solvent will comprise from about 10% to 60% by weight of the liquid phase, most preferably from about 20% to 50% by weight, of the liquid phase of the composition. Utilization of this organic solvent in these concentrations in the liquid phase corresponds to a solvent concentration in the total composition of from about 1% to 50% by weight, more preferably from about 5% to 40% by weight, and most preferably from about 10% to 30% by weight, of the composition.</p><p>iii) Alcohol Alkoxylate To Solvent Ratio</p><p>The ratio of alcohol alkoxylate to organic solvent within the liquid diluent can be used to vary the rheological properties of the detergent compositions eventually formed. Generally, the weight ratio of alcohol alkoxylate to organic solvent will range from about 50:1 to 1:50. More preferably, this ratio will range from about 3:1 to 1:3.</p><p>iv) Liquid Diluent Concentration</p><p>As with the concentration of the alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant mixture, the amount of total liquid diluent in the nonaqueous liquid phase herein will be determined by the type and amounts of other composition components and by the desired composition properties. Generally, the liquid diluent will comprise from about 35% to 70% of the nonaqueous liquid phase of the compositions herein. More preferably, the liquid diluent will comprise from about 50% to 65% of the nonaqueous liquid phase. This corresponds to a nonaqueous liquid diluent concentration in the total composition of from about 15% to 70% by weight, more preferably from about 20% to 50% by weight, of the composition.</p><p>Solid Phase</p><p>The nonaqueous detergent compositions herein also essentially comprise from about 1% to 65% by weight, more preferably from about 5% to 50% by weight, of a solid phase of particulate material which is dispersed and suspended within the liquid phase. Generally such particulate material will range in size from about 0.1 to 1500 microns. More preferably such material will range in size from about 5 to 200 microns.</p><p>The particulate material utilized herein can comprise one or more types of detergent composition components which in particulate form are substantially insoluble in the nonaqueous liquid phase of the composition. The types of particulate materials which can be utilized are described in detail as follows:</p><p>Composition Preparation and Use</p><p>The nonaqueous liquid detergent compositions herein can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components thereof in any convenient order and by mixing, e.g., agitating, the resulting component combination to form the phase stable compositions herein. In a typical process for preparing such compositions, essential and certain preferred optional components will be combined in a particular order and under certain conditions.</p><p>In the first step of such a typical preparation process, an admixture of the alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant and the two essential components of the nonaqueous diluent is formed by heating a combination of these materials to a temperature from about 30 C.</p><p>In a second process step, the heated admixture formed as hereinbefore described is maintained under shear agitation at a temperature from about 40 hours. Optionally, a vacuum can be applied to the admixture at this point. This second process step serves to completely dissolve the anionic surfactant in the nonaqueous liquid phase.</p><p>In a third process step, this liquid phase combination of materials is cooled to a temperature of from about 0 cooling step serves to form a structured, surfactant-containing liquid base into which the particulate material of the detergent compositions herein can be added and dispersed.</p><p>Particulate material is added in a fourth process step by combining the particulate material with the liquid base which is maintained under conditions of shear agitation. When more than one type of particulate material is to be added, it is preferred that a certain order of addition be observed. For example, while shear agitation is maintained, essentially all of any optional surfactants in solid particulate form can be added in the form of particles ranging in size from about 0.2 to 1,000 microns. After addition of any optional surfactant particles, particles of substantially all of an organic builder, e.g., citrate and/or fatty acid, and/or an alkalinity source, e.g., sodium carbonate, can be added while continuing to maintain this admixture of composition components under shear agitation. Other solid form optional ingredients can then be added to the composition at this point. Agitation of the mixture is continued, and if necessary, can be increased at this point to form a uniform dispersion of insoluble solid phase particulates within the liquid phase.</p><p>After some or all of the foregoing solid materials have been added to this agitated mixture, the particles of the bleaching agent can be added to the composition, again while the mixture is maintained under shear agitation. By adding the bleaching agent material last, or after all or most of the other components, and especially after alkalinity source particles, have been added, desirable stability benefits for the bleach can be realized. If enzyme prills are incorporated, they are preferably added to the nonaqueous liquid matrix last.</p><p>As a final process step, after addition of all of the particulate material, agitation of the mixture is continued for a period of time sufficient to form compositions having the requisite viscosity and phase stability characteristics. Frequently this will involve agitation for a period of from about 1 to 30 minutes.</p><p>As a variation of the composition preparation procedure hereinbefore described, one or more of the solid components may be added to the agitated mixture as a slurry of particles premixed with a minor portion of one or more of the liquid components. Thus a premix of a small fraction of the alcohol alkoxylate and/or nonaqueous, low-polarity solvent with particles of the organic builder material and/or the particles of the inorganic alkalinity source and/or particles of a bleach activator may be separately formed and added as a slurry to the agitated mixture of composition components. Addition of such slurry premixes should precede addition of bleaching agent and/or enzyme particles which may themselves be part of a premix slurry formed in analogous fashion.</p><p>The compositions of this invention, prepared as hereinbefore described, can be used to form aqueous washing solutions for use in the laundering and bleaching of fabrics. Generally, an effective amount of such compositions is added to water, preferably in a conventional fabric laundering automatic washing machine, to form such aqueous laundering/bleaching solutions. The aqueous washing/bleaching solution so formed is then contacted, preferably under agitation, with the fabrics to be laundered and bleached therewith.</p><p>An effective amount of the liquid detergent compositions herein added to water to form aqueous laundering/bleaching solutions can comprise amounts sufficient to form from about 500 to 7,000 ppm of composition in aqueous solution.
