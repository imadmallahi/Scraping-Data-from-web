October 7, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading><u style="single">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0002">This invention relates to a catalyst for hydrotreating and a process for hydrotreating
hydrocarbon oils using the same, more particularly to the multi-component solid catalyst
with a hydrogenation-active component dispersed uniformly in a matrix of refractory,
inorganic oxide, and the process for hydro-treating hydrocarbon oils using the same.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGOUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0003">Various types of catalysts have been proposed for hydrotreating hydrocarbon oils, e.g.,
those with one or more hydrogenation-active components carried by a refractory inorganic
oxide (e.g., alumina, silica, magnesia and zirconia), and the hydrogenation-active component
is selected from the group consisting of the group 6A elements (e.g., molybdenum, tungsten
and chromium) and the group 8 elements (e.g., cobalt and nickel).</p><p num="0004">One of the widely used methods for producing these catalysts is impregnation, in
which a carrier is impregnated with an aqueous solution of a group 6A element and group 8
element, dried and calcined. One of the disadvantages involved in the impregnation method
is difficulty in dispersing the active component highly uniformly, because it is highly mobile
during the catalyst production process from adsorption or precipitation to completion of
drying. This mobility comes from the weak bond between the active component and carrier,
because the carrier is impregnated, after it is prepared, with a solution of the active
component, with the result that it is merely adsorbed or precipitated on the carrier.</p><p num="0005">Other disadvantages are limited content of the active component and difficulty in
controlling the content in an optimum range. The active component is immobilized on the 
already prepared carrier, by which is meant that content of the active component tends to be
limited by total pore volume of the carrier.</p><p num="0006">The conventional catalyst, therefore, tends to suffer lack of homogeneity and
decreased number of active sites, when content of the active component is optimized to
enhance catalyst hydrotreating activity. This tends to limit its activity. Therefore, new
techniques for the catalysts of high homogeneity and activity have been increasingly in
demand. As one of the attempts to realize such a catalyst, Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 83603/1986 discloses a method for producing a homogeneous, amorphous
complex metal oxide. This method, however, involves several disadvantages. First,
satisfying the amorphous condition tends to limit content of the hydrogenation-active
component, and hence catalyst activity for hydrotreating. A carrier containing crystalline
compound, e.g., α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which has an effective function as the carrier for hydrotreating
catalyst is no longer used for this method. An amorphous metal oxide is unstable and low in
mechanical strength, and hence unsuitable for a commercial catalyst which is required to
exhibit long serviceability.</p><p num="0007">Recently, reduction of sulfur content of gas oil is strongly required for environmental
reasons, especially by deep desulfurization of stocks of high sulfur contents, e.g., light gas
oil (LGO), vacuum gas oil (VGO) and cracked gas oil. In particular, sulfur content of diesel
fuel oil is required to be reduced to 0.05 wt.% or lower. The techniques to achieve the
required desulfurization level have been studied from wide angles, and it is now considered
that whether this is achieved or not largely depends on whether sulfur compounds difficult to
remove, e.g., 4-methyl dibenzothiophene and 4-6-dimethyl dibenzothiophene, are efficiently
desulfurized. Development of catalysts of higher activity is essential also viewed from the
above point.</p><p num="0008">It would be desirable to provide a high-activity hydrotreating catalyst, with a
hydrogenation-active component highly dispersed, high in homogeneity and containing a
crystalline component, which is also high in desulfurization activity for hydrotreating
hydrocarbon oil, and also excellent in activity for, e.g., denitrogenation, dearomatization and
cracking and which can treat diversified types of hydrocarbon oils, e.g.,
hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, hydrodearomatization, hydroisomerization, 
hydrocracking, hydrodewaxing, hydrodemetallization, in particular deep
hydrodesulfurization of a diesel fuel fraction.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0009">The inventors of the present invention have found, after having conducted extensive

The hydrotreating catalyst is able to exhibit high uniformity, when each of its active
components satisfies the relationship (1) or (2), </li><li>(3) Thirdly, one or more diffraction lines relevant to crystalline component are observed by

contents of the hydrogenation-active component in the variation range, determined by the
EPMA line analysis.</p><p num="0015">The compounds useful for the refractory inorganic matrix as the constituent of the

oxide, boria, zirconia, titania, thoria, ceria, hafnia, phosphorus oxide, and various other metal
oxides. In particular, oxide compositions having two or more oxides can be used. These

titania, zirconia, ceria, hafnia, thoria and phosphorus oxide. More concretely, these
composites include alumina-silica-boria, alumina-silica-titania, alumina-silica-zirconia,
alumina-silica-ceria, alumina-silica-magnesia, alumina-silica-halfnia, alumina-silica-phosphorus

the present invention is uniformly dispersed in the above refractory inorganic oxide matrix.</p><p num="0019">The hydrogenation-active component comprises at least one active component (A)
selected from the group consisting of the group 6A elements, and/or at least one active

components (A), (B) and (C), to be dispersed in the refractory inorganic oxide matrix
are uniformly sized, and</li><li>(2) these particles are dispersed at constant intervals.</li></sl></p><p num="0026">The catalyst will have high activity, when the active component particles are highly
uniform in size and dispersed highly uniformly (i.e., at constant intervals), because it will
have the active sites distributed widely and uniformly.</p><p num="0027">Homogeneity of the hydrotreating catalyst of the present invention is determined by
electron probe microanalysis (referred to as "EPMA", as required). More concretely, EPMA
line analysis or plane analysis is used, depending on size of the active component particles
and distance between these particles, and the results are used to determine homogeneity.</p><p num="0028">EPMA line analysis determines concentration distribution of the active component of
the group 6A element and/or group 8 element or the like in the catalyst section, trying to
evaluate homogeneity based on the EPMA line analysis data obtained by numerically
expressing variation range. The inventors of the present invention have found, after having
analyzed a number of experimental results, that a catalyst is highly homogeneous and shows
notable effects of hydrotreating, e.g., hydrodesulfurization, when it satisfies the following
relationship:</p><p num="0029">The relationship (1) is expressed as follows:

wherein N<sub>max</sub>, N<sub>min</sub> and N<sub>0</sub> are the maximum, minimum and average contents of the
hydrogenation-active component in the variation range of the catalyst section, determined by
EPMA line analysis.</p><p num="0030">Any hydrogenation-active component is to be evaluated by the EPMA line analysis
when it is present at 0.002 mol/mol or more in the catalyst. When two or more types of the
hydrogenation-active components are present, each is to be evaluated, needless to say when
one type of the hydrogenation-active component is present. The inventors of the present
invention have found that activity of the catalyst is not greatly affected by its homogeneity,
when the hydrogenation-active component is present at below 0.002 mol/mol. Therefore,
activity of the catalyst for, e.g., desulfurization, can be sufficiently evaluated, when
homogeneity of each hydrogenation-active component present at 0.002 mol/mol or more is
measured. The hydrogenation-active component includes the above-described active 
components (A), (B) and (C). Each component should satisfy the relationship (1), when it is
present at 0.002 mol/mol or more.</p><p num="0031">On the other hand, the EPMA plane analysis measures size and size distribution
morphology of the active component particles, processing images to numerically express
uniformity of the size and its distribution.</p><p num="0032">It is found by the plane analysis that a catalyst is highly homogeneous and shows
notable effects of hydrodesulfurization, when it satisfies the following relationship:</p><p num="0033">The relationship (2) is expressed as follows:

wherein S parameter and P parameter are an index for size uniformity and distribution
uniformity of the active component particles, respectively, each determined by processing
the images obtained by the EPMA plane analysis.</p><p num="0034">S parameter is determined by processing the EPMA plane images using an image

wherein (m) is number of the divided sections of the same area, and (bi) is an area of the i<sup>th</sup>

The hydrotreating catalyst of the present invention contains a crystalline component, which
represents another characteristic of the present invention together with its homogeneity. Its
presence is judged when one or more diffraction lines are observed in the spectral pattern
obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). A concrete example is given in Figure 1,
which shows the XRD spectral pattern of the catalyst prepared by EXAMPLE 2. As shown,
the sharp peaks relevant to the crystalline system are observed at specific diffraction angles.
Figure 2, on the other hand, gives the XRD spectral pattern of the catalyst prepared by
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3, showing no crystal-derived diffraction line, indicating that
the catalyst is amorphous.</p><p num="0037">A catalyst, when containing a crystalline component, shows higher activity because of
its capacity to contain a larger quantity of the active component. It will show still higher
activity, when it contains a component having a crystalline compound such as α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
known to exhibit an effective function as a refractory inorganic oxide. Moreover, a
crystalline component will secure a sufficient strength, and hence serviceability, for a
commercial hydrotreating catalyst.</p><p num="0038">Next, the method for producing the hydrotreating catalyst of the present invention is
described. The method for producing the catalyst is not limited, but the one suitable for the
present invention is coprecipitation, which simultaneously precipitates two or more catalyst
components from a mixture which contains at least one hydrogenation-active component.</p><p num="0039">More concretely, the process comprising the following steps can be used:
<sl><li>(1) oxygenated organometallic compounds as the starting materials for the refractory
inorganic oxide matrix and inorganic metal salt as the starting material for the
hydrogenation-active component are dissolved in a non-aqueous solvent, to prepare a
homogeneous solution,</li><li>(2) a precipitant-containing solution is added to the homogeneous solution prepared by the
step (1), to prepare a gel slurry from the homogeneous sol,</li><li>(3) the gel slurry prepared by the step (2) is aged, and</li><li>(4) the aged gel is dried and calcined.</li></sl></p><p num="0040">The compounds useful as the starting material for the refractory inorganic oxide
matrix include alkoxides, acetylacetonates and carboxylates of aluminum, silicon,
magnesium, calcium, boron, zirconium, titanium, thorium, cerium, hafnium and gallium, of
which alkoxides with an alkoxyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 5 are preferable for
their easiness of handling. These include aluminum methoxide, aluminum ethoxide,
aluminum isopropoxide, aluminum butoxide, tetramethoxy silane, tetraethoxy silane,
tetraisopropoxy silane, tetra-t-butoxy silane, magnesium methoxide, magnesium ethoxide,
magnesium isopropoxide, calcium methoxide, boron methoxide, boron ethoxide, zirconium
ethoxide, zirconium propoxide, zirconium-sec-butoxide, titanium ethoxide, titanium
isopropoxide and hafnium ethoxide.</p><p num="0041">The compounds useful as the starting materials for the hydrogenation-active
component include the inorganic metal salts described earlier. More concretely, they include
nitrates, chlorides, oxychlorides and sulfides of molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, iron,
cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, copper, zinc,
manganese and rhenium; and ammonium salts of the acids of the above metals. In addition
to the above inorganic metal salts, organic metal salts, e.g., acetates, oxalates and alkoxides,
may be also used.</p><p num="0042">The non-aqueous solvents useful for the present invention include monoalcohols,
divalent alcohols, ketoalcohols, aminoalcohols and carboxylic acids. Quantity of the
reaction material may be determined, depending on content of the desired catalytic
component.</p><p num="0043">In the step (1), the homogeneous solution can be prepared by dissolving oxygenated
organometallic compounds (e.g., aluminum alkoxide and silicon alkoxide) in a non-aqueous
solvent with stirring, to which an inorganic metal salt (e.g., ammonium molybdate, or nitrate
of cobalt or nickel) is added with stirring, to form the homogeneous solution. Aqueous
solutions of ammonium molybdate, and nitrate of cobalt or nickel, or the like may be added
in the subsequent step (2) to the homogeneous solution prepared in the step (1) by dissolving
aluminum alkoxide and silicon alkoxide in a non-aqueous solvent with stirring. The hydro-treating
catalyst of the present invention, high in homogeneity, containing a crystalline
component and satisfying the relationship (1) or (2) described earlier can be produced by, in 
particular, controlling, e.g., temperature, pressure, stirring conditions, size of the gel
particles, gel particle concentration, and quantity of hydrolyzing water in the precipitant
solution, in the step (2) as the sol-preparation step.</p> <p num="0044">In the step (1), the non-aqueous solvent is preferably used at 0.1 moles to 50 moles per
mole of the total metallic and semi-metallic elements and phosphorus which constitute the
hydrotreating catalyst, more preferably 1 mol/mol to 20 mol/mol. It is essential to avoid use
of an excessive quantity of the solvent while controlling the reaction conditions in such a
way to form the stable, fluid gel slurry, in order to prepare the catalyst of high homogeneity.</p><p num="0045">In the aging step (3), the gel slurry is held at 50°C to 99°C preferably for at least 1
hour. This aging step mainly controls pore characteristics of the catalyst, to enhance its
reaction activity.</p><p num="0046">The aged gel slurry as the catalyst precursor is treated by filtration, settling, centrifugal
separation or evaporation to adjust content of the water-containing solvent, and formed into a
shape by tablet making, extrusion, rotary granulation or the like. The catalyst may be
cylindrical, table-shaped, spherical or others, such as that having a four-leaf section. It is
important for the catalyst to have a shape and size which allow to control packing density in
the reactor. It is preferable to adjust size of the catalyst pellets, which is porous, for
increasing packing density. Catalyst diameter is normally in a range from 0.5mm to 20 mm
on the average, viewed from increasing packing density and controlling pressure loss.</p><p num="0047">The catalyst pellets formed in the step (3) are then dried and calcined in the step (4).
They may be dried by one of many methods, e.g., air-drying, drying in hot wind, drying
under heating and freeze drying. They are calcined at 150°C to 700°C at which they are held
for 1hour to 20 hours in an oxidative, reducing, inert, sulfiding, nitriding, carbonizing or
steam atmosphere depending on their specific purposes.</p><p num="0048">The hydrotreating catalyst of the present invention has a specific surface area of 10
m<sup>2</sup>/g to 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g (preferably 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g), total pore volume of 0.1ml/g to 2 ml/g
(preferably 0.2 ml/g to 1.5 ml/g) and average pore diameter of 4Å to 1000Å (preferably 10Å 
to 600Å), is high in homogeneity, contains a crystalline component, and is suitable as the
catalyst for hydrotreating a hydro-carbon oil.</p> <p num="0049">The present invention provides a hydrotreating catalyst, applicable to all types of the
reactions proceeding in the presence of hydrogen, in particular hydrofinishing,
hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, hydrodearomatization, hydroisomerization,
hydrocracking, hydrodewaxing, hydrodemetallization and the like. The process of the present
invention for hydrotreating a hydrocarbon oil is described as follows.</p> <p num="0050">The hydrotreating process of the present invention includes all of the reactions, e.g.,
hydrofining, hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, hydrodearomatization,
hydroisomerization, hydrocracking, hydrodewaxing, hydrodemetallization, occurring when
hydrocarbon oils are brought into contact with hydrogen in the presence of the hydrotreating
catalyst of the present invention under hydrotreating conditions. The hydrotreating conditions
can be optionally selected for the desired reactions. The hydrotreating catalyst of the present
invention is particularly suitable for the hydrodesulfurization of hydrocarbon oils.</p> <p num="0051">Hydrocarbon oils which can be treated by the hydrotreating process of the present
invention are not limited. They include petroleum-derived oils, e.g., atmospheric distillates,
atmospheric residue, vacuum distillates, vacuum residue, cracked distillates, raffinates,
hydrotreated oils, deasphalted oils, slack wax, Fischer-Tropsch wax and a mixture thereof.
They also include oils derived from tar sand, shale oil, coal-liquefied oil, and a mixture
thereof. The catalyst of the present invention is particularly suitable for treating vacuum,
cracked and straight-run distillates to remove their sulfur- and nitrogen-containing
compounds which are difficult to remove.</p><p num="0052">A vacuum distillate, produced by treating atmospheric residue under a vacuum, boils
at around 370°C to 610°C, and contains significant quantities of sulfur, nitrogen and metals,
e.g., at 2.0 wt.% and 800 wt.ppm for sulfur and nitrogen. The sulfur-containing compounds
include 4-methylbenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyl-benzothiophene. The nitrogen-containing
compounds include pyridines, amines and amides which are basic, and pyrroles which are
weakly basic. The metals include nickel, vanadium and iron. The catalyst produced by the 
method of the present invention can treat these vacuum distillates most efficiently to remove
sulfur and nitrogen.</p><p num="0053">Cracked distillates are the fractions boiling at around 200°C or higher, produced by
thermal cracking (e.g., coking or visbreaking) of residue, or light cycle gas oil (LCGO) or
heavy cycle gas oil (HCGO) produced by a fluid catalytic cracking unit.</p><p num="0054">The atmospheric distillates which can be treated by the hydrotreating process of the
present invention include straight-run naphtha, heavy naphtha and kerosene fractions. They
also include gasoline components produced by various cracking units, e.g., catalytically
cracked naphtha, thermally cracked naphtha and steam-cracked naphtha, and other light
fractions used as fuel components which boil at around 250°C or lower.</p><p num="0055">The hydrotreating conditions are not limited. They can be adequately selected for
specific situations, e.g., type of hydrocarbon oil to be treated and desired reactions, and
target desulfurization and denitrogenation levels. The preferable conditions are reaction
temperature: 150°C to 500°C, more preferably 200°C to 450°C; reaction pressure: 1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>
to 350 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 5 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 300 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>; hydrogen-containing treat gas rate:
30l/l to 2000 l/l, more preferably 35l/l to 1800 l/l; and liquid hourly space velocity: 0.01
V/H/V to 20.0 V/H/V, more preferably 0.05 V/H/V to 10.0 V/H/V. They are most preferably
250°C to 400°C as reaction temperature, 40 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 100 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> as reaction pressure,
180l/l to 230 l/l as hydrogen-containing treat gas rate and 0.8 V/H/V to 1.5 V/H/V as liquid
hourly space velocity. Hydrogen content in treat gas is normally in a range from 60% to
100%.</p><p num="0056">The hydrotreating catalyst of the present invention exhibits high activities for, e.g.,
desulfurization, denitrogenation and dearomatization and also high activity maintenance
capacity therefor, and can achieve with stability required performance, e.g., desulfurization
rate, for extended periods under the severe conditions which would deactivate the
conventional catalyst in a short time, in particular under low reaction pressure.</p><p num="0057">Hydrotreatment of a hydrocarbon oil over the catalyst of the present invention can be
effected in any type of reactor, e.g., fixed, fluidized, ebullated or moving bed type. A fixed 
bed type is a normal choice, for its simpler process and higher operability. Two or more
reactors may be connected in series for deeper hydrotreatment. This is a particularly
preferable configuration, when heavy oil is to be treated. Hydrocarbon oil may be brought
into contact with a hydrogen-containing treat gas either co-currently or counter-currently.</p><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLES</u></heading><p num="0058">The present invention is described more concretely by EXAMPLES, which by no
