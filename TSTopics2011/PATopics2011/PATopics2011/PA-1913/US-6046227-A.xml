More specifically, the present invention relates to selective Î².sub.3 adrenergic receptor agonists useful in the treatment of Type II diabetes and obesity.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The current preferred treatment for Type II, non-insulin dependent, diabetes as well as obesity is diet and exercise, with a view toward weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. Patient compliance, however, is usually poor. There are no currently approved medications that adequately treat either Type II diabetes or obesity. The invention described herein is directed toward an effective and timely treatment for these serious diseases.</p><p>One recently recognized therapeutic opportunity involves the relationship between adrenergic receptor stimulation and anti-hyperglycemic effects. Compounds that act as Î².sub.3 adrenergic receptor agonists have been shown to exhibit a marked effect on lipolysis, thermogenesis, and serum glucose levels in animal models of Type II diabetes.</p><p>The Î².sub.3 receptor, which is found in several types of human tissue including human fat tissue, has roughly 50% homology to the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptor subtypes yet is considerably less abundant. The importance of the Î².sub.3 receptor is a relatively recent discovery since the amino-acid sequence of the human receptor was only elucidated in the late 1980's. A large number of publications have appeared in recent years reporting success in discovery of agents that stimulate the Î².sub.3 receptor. Despite these recent developments there remains a need to develop a selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonist which has both high intrinsic activity and minimal agonist activity against the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention provides a novel compound represented by Formula (I) below and methods of treating Type II diabetes, treating obesity, and stimulating the Î².sub.3 receptor which comprise administering to a patient in need thereof a compound described by Formula I below. ##STR1## wherein: X.sub.1 is --OCH.sub.2 --, --SCH.sub.2 --, or a bond;</p><p>R.sub.1 is a heterocycle of the formula: ##STR2## R.sub.2 and R.sub.3 are independently hydrogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, or aryl;</p><p>R.sub.4 is an optionally substituted heterocycle or a moiety selected from the group consisting of: ##STR3## X.sub.2 is a bond, or a 1 to 5 carbon straight or branched alkylene; R.sub.5 is hydrogen or C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl;</p><p>R.sub.6 is hydrogen or C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl;</p><p>or R.sub.5 and R.sub.6 combine with the carbon to which each is attached to form a C.sub.3 -C.sub.6 cycloalkyl;</p><p>or R.sub.6 combines with X.sub.2 and the carbon to which each is attached to form a C.sub.3 -C.sub.8 cycloalkyl;</p><p>or R.sub.6 combines with X.sub.2, R.sub.4, and the carbon to which each is attached to form: ##STR4##  provided that R.sub.5 is hydrogen; R.sub.7 is hydrogen, hydroxy, cyano, oxo, CO.sub.n R.sub.2, CONHR.sub.2, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxy, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 haloalkyl, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 optionally substituted alkyl, (CH.sub.2).sub.n aryl, (CH.sub.2).sub.n heterocycle, (CH.sub.2).sub.n optionally substituted aryl, or (CH.sub.2).sub.n optionally substituted heterocycle;</p><p>R.sub.8 is independently hydrogen, halo, or C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl;</p><p>R.sub.9 is halo, CN, OR.sub.10, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 haloalkyl, CO.sub.2 R.sub.2, CONR.sub.11 R.sub.12, CONH(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl or C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxy), SR.sub.2, CSNHR.sub.2, CSNR.sub.11 R.sub.12, SO.sub.2 R.sub.2, SOR.sub.2, NR.sub.11 R.sub.12, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted heterocycle, or C.sub.2 -C.sub.4 alkenyl substituted with CN, CO.sub.2 R.sub.2, or CONR.sub.11 R.sub.12 ;</p><p>R.sub.10 is C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 haloalkyl, (CH.sub.2).sub.n C.sub.3 -C.sub.8 cycloalkyl, (CH.sub.2).sub.n aryl, (CH.sub.2).sub.n heterocycle, (CH.sub.2).sub.n C.sub.3 -C.sub.8 optionally substituted cycloalkyl, (CH.sub.2).sub.n optionally substituted aryl, or (CH.sub.2).sub.n optionally substituted heterocycle;</p><p>R.sub.11 and R.sub.12 are independently hydrogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, aryl, (CH.sub.2).sub.n aryl, or combine with the nitrogen to which each is bound to form morpholinyl, piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, or piperazinyl;</p><p>R.sub.13 is hydrogen, halo, aryl, or C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl;</p><p>m is 0 or 1;</p><p>n is 0, 1, 2, or 3;</p><p>or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p>The present invention also provides novel pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of Formula I.</p><p>The present invention also provides a novel compound of Formula (I) wherein all variables except R.sub.4, R.sub.6 and R.sub.9 are as described above.

As they relate to the present invention, the terms below may not be interpreted, individually or collectively, to describe chemical structures that are unstable or impossible to construct.</p><p>The term "halo" represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine.</p><p>The term "C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl" represents a cyclo, straight, or branched chain alkyl group having from one to four carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, and the like. A "haloalkyl" is one such alkyl substituted with one or more halo atoms, preferably one to three halo atoms. An example of a haloalkyl is trifluoromethyl. An "alkoxy" is a alkyl group covalently bonded by an --O-- linkage.</p><p>The term "1 to 5 carbon straight or branched alkylene" represents a one to five carbon, straight or branched, alkylene moiety. A branched alkylene may have one or more points of branching. A 1 to 5 carbon straight or branched alkylene may optionally be unsaturated at one or more carbons. Thus, a 1 to 5 carbon straight or branched alkylene includes 1 to 5 carbon alkylene, alkenylene and alkylidene moieties. Examples include but are not intended to be limited to methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, --CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)CH.sub.2 --, --CH(CH.sub.3)CH(CH.sub.3)--, --CH.sub.2 C(CH.sub.3).sub.2 --, --CH.sub.2 CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 --, --C(CH.sub.3).sub.2 CHâ, --CHâCHCH.sub.2 --, --CHâCH--, --CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 --CâCCH.sub.2 --, and the like.</p><p>The "acyl" moiety, alone or in combination, is derived from an alkanoic acid containing from one to seven carbon atoms. The term "acyl" also includes moieties derived from an aryl carboxylic acid.</p><p>The term "aryl" represents an optionally substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl. The term (CH.sub.2).sub.n aryl is preferably benzyl or phenyl.</p><p>The term "optionally substituted" as used herein means an optional substitution of one to three, preferably one or two groups independently selected from halo, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 haloalkyl, hydroxy, carboxy, tetrazolyl, acyl, COOR.sub.2, CONR.sub.11 R.sub.12, CONH(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxy), cyano, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkoxy, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, nitro, NR.sub.11 R.sub.12, NHCO(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), NHCO(benzyl), NHCO(phenyl), SR.sub.2, S(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), OCO(C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), SO.sub.2 (C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl), or SO.sub.2 (phenyl); provided that such substitution does not entirely destroy biological activity, as defined in this specification.</p><p>R.sub.2 and R.sub.3 are independently hydrogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, or aryl.</p><p>R.sub.11 and R.sub.12 are independently hydrogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, or combine with the nitrogen to which each is bound to form morpholinyl, piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, or piperazinyl.</p><p>The term "heterocycle" represents a stable, optionally substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated 5 or 6 membered ring, said ring having from one to four heteroatoms that are the same or different and that are selected from the group consisting of sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. When the heterocycle contains two adjacent carbon atoms, the adjacent carbon atoms may be structured to form a group of the formula --CHâCH--; provided that (1) when the heterocyclic ring contains 5 members, the heteroatoms comprise not more than two sulfur or two oxygen atoms but not both, and (2) when the heterocyclic ring contains 6 members and is aromatic; sulfur and oxygen are not present. The heterocycle may be attached at any carbon or nitrogen which affords a stable structure. Examples of heterocycles include, but are not intended to be limited to, pyrazole, pyrazoline, imidazole, isoxazole, triazole, tetrazole, oxazole, 1,3-dioxolone, thiazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, piperazine, morpholine, pyrazine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, oxazolidone, oxazolidinedione, imidazolidinone, and the like.</p><p>The term "leaving group" as used in the specification is understood by those skilled in the art. Generally, a leaving group is any group or atom that enhances the electrophilicity of the atom to which it is attached for displacement. Preferred leaving groups include but are not intended to be limited to p-nitrobenzene sulfonate, triflate, mesylate, tosylate, imidate, chloride, bromide, iodide, and the like.</p><p>The term "pharmaceutically effective amount", as used herein, represents an amount of a compound of the invention that is capable of stimulating the Î².sub.3 receptor in mammals. The particular dose of the compound administered according to this invention will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the patient, including the compound administered, the route of administration, the particular condition being treated, and similar considerations.</p><p>The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.</p><p>The term "treating," as used herein, describes the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating the disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of a compound of the present invention to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications, to alleviate the symptoms or complications, or to eliminate the disease, condition, or disorder.</p><p>The term "selective" means preferential agonism of the Î².sub.3 receptor over agonism of the Î².sub.1 or Î².sub.2 receptor. In general, the compounds demonstrate at least about a twenty fold differential (preferably over a 50 fold differential) in the dosage required to behave as an agonist to the Î².sub.3 receptor and the dosage required for equal agonism of the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors as measured in the Functional Agonist Assay as described hereinafter. The compounds demonstrate this differential across the range of doses.

Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this invention thus include, but are not intended to be limited to, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, methylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, and the like.</p><p>Because of a basic moiety, some of the compounds of Formula I can also exist as pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.

Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention can be prepared as single enatiomers or diastereomers by chiral synthesis or resolution techniques well known in the art. Therefore, the racemates, individual enantiomers, diastereomers, or mixtures thereof form part of the present invention. Unless otherwise specified, whenever a compound is described or referenced in this specification all the racemates, individual enantiomers, diastereomers, or mixtures thereof are included in said reference or description.</p><heading>SYNTHESIS</heading><p>The compounds of Formula I are prepared as described in the following Schemes and Examples. Schemes I and I describe methodology for the preparation of final embodiments of the present invention. Schemes III-VI represent methodology for the preparation of intermediates required for the construction of the final embodiments of the invention. ##STR9##</p><p>In Scheme I, X.sub.1, X.sub.2, R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.4, R.sub.5, and R.sub.6 have the same meaning as previously described. The reaction of Scheme I is carried out under conditions known in the art for the amination of epoxides. For example, the epoxide (A) may be combined with the amine (B) in an alcohol, such as ethanol, at room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably, the reaction is carried under conditions generally described in Atkins et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 27:2451 (1986). These conditions include mixing the reagents in the presence of trimethylsilyl acetamide in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), tetrahydrofuran (THF), or other polar aprotic solvents in which the reagents are soluble. Preferably, the solvent is DMSO. The reaction is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 0</p><p>Certain compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a combinatorial/parallel chemical array synthesis, as shown in Scheme II. ##STR10##</p><p>In Scheme II, X.sub.1, X.sub.2, R.sub.1, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 have the same meaning as previously described and R.sub.6 is hydrogen. The reaction of Scheme II is preferably carried out by adding to a glass vial an amine (IV), ketone (V), and a non-reactive solvent such as methanol, DMF, methylene chloride, acetonitrile, or the like. The solution is shaken at room temperature to allow for imine formation and then treated with Amberlite IRA400 borohydride resin (Aldrich Chemicals). The slurry is then shaken for about 24 hours to effect reduction to the secondary amine. Methylene chloride and polystyrene-linked benzaldehyde resin (Frechet, J. M. et al., J. Am Chem. Soc. 93:492 (1971)) is added to the vial in order to scavenge excess primary amine starting material. The slurry is shaken, preferably overnight. The slurry is then filtered and the residual solids are rinsed with methanol. Evaporation under a flow of air, followed by drying for several hours at room temperature in a vacuum oven yields the desired product of sufficient purity.</p><p>A modification of Scheme II is necessary when the amine hydrochloride salt is used. Addition of resin-bound base to the initial reaction mixture prior to reduction or scavenging allows the desired reaction to proceed. Imine formation using amine hydrochloride salts, an aldehyde or ketone, and a resin bound amine base may be carried out using one of two different resins: poly(4-vinylpyridine) commercially available from Aldrich, and resin (VIII), which can be synthesized by the reaction of Merrifield resin with piperidine as is shown in Scheme IIa. ##STR11## In Scheme IIa, PS is polysytrene. Both the poly(4-vinylpyridine) and resin (VIII) promote imine formation.</p><p>Scheme II can also be carried out by utilization of traditional techniques. For example, reductive aminations described in scheme II are well known in the art. They are typically performed by mixing the amine and ketone starting materials in a solvent and adding a reducing agent. Solvents typically include lower alcohols, DMF, and the like. Although a wide variety of reducing agents can be utilized, most commonly utilized are sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, and the like. The reaction can be typically performed at room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Products can be isolated by techniques well known in the art.</p><p>The ketone and amino starting materials of Scheme II can be prepared by techniques which are well known by one skilled in the art. The synthesis of the starting materials is generally described in Schemes III and IV. ##STR12##</p><p>In Scheme III, R.sub.1 is the same as previously defined. R.sub.14 is OH or SH. Equimolar amounts of the aromatic compound (Compound IX) and (2S)-(+)-glycidyl 3-nitrobenzenesulfonate (Compound X) can be dissolved in an inert solvent such as acetone and treated with 1.1 equivalents of a non-reactive acid scavenger, such as K.sub.2 CO.sub.3. The suspension is then heated at reflux for about 16-20 hours with stirring. The solvent can be removed in vacuo. The residue is partitioned between chloroform or other organic solvent and water. The organic layer can be dried over Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4 and concentrated in vacuo to give the compound (XI) in sufficient purity (&amp;gt;95%) and yield (85-100%).</p><p>Alternatively, the compound of formula (IX) can be reacted with epichlorohydrin, by methods known in the art, to yield compounds of formula (XB). The compounds of formula (XB) can be closed to the epoxide compounds of formula (XI) by methods well known in the art.</p><p>The epoxide (XI) can be dissolved in an alcohol, preferably methanol, and treated with one equivalent of dibenzylamine. The solution is preferably stirred at reflux for about three to four hours and then cooled to ambient temperature. Approximately 10 equivalents of ammonium formate are added to the flask, followed by 10% palladium on carbon, and the suspension stirred vigorously at reflux for 30-45 minutes. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and then filtered, concentrated in vacuo to a minimum volume and treated with 1.1 equivalents of a 1.0 M anhydrous solution of HCl in ether. The solution is concentrated to dryness. The solid residue is triturated with pentane to yield products of sufficient purity and yield. If desired, further purification may be carried out by passing over a short plug of silica, eluting with CHCl.sub.3, then 95:5 CHCl.sub.3/ MeOH, then 25:5:1 CHCl.sub.3/ MeOH/NH.sub.4 OH.</p><p>Alternatively, the epoxide (XI) can be treated with a solution of methanol saturated with ammonia gas and stirred at room temperature in a sealed tube for 16 hours. This solution is then evaporated, and the residue subjected to standard purifications such as column chromatography or recrystallization. The HCl salt is then optionally produced by the addition of HCl gas in ether.</p><p>A skilled artisan would appreciate that, in order to increase yields or limit side products, it may be advantageous to appropriately protect the intermediates utilized in the synthesis of compounds of formula (XII). Choice of protecting groups will be governed by the ease of protection and deprotection as well as compatibility with the reaction conditions. A wide variety of protection strategies could be utilized to perform the transformations of scheme III. For examples see Greene T. W.; Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, (1981).</p><p>The reaction of Scheme III is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,761 and references cited therein. U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,761 is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p>The ketone moieties of Scheme II, that are either unknown in the art or not commercially available, are prepared in accordance with Scheme IV. ##STR13##</p><p>In Scheme IV, R.sub.4 and R.sub.5 are the same as previously defined. The notation ---- indicates optional branching. Preferably, R.sub.4 is a substituted phenyl. The reaction described in Scheme IV is referred to as a Heck reaction and is described in A. J. Chalk et al., J. Org. Chem. 41: 1206 (1976). The reaction is achieved by treating compound (XIII) with an arylpalladium reagent. The arylpalladium reagent is generated in situ by treating Compound (XIV) with a palladium-triarylphosphine complex. The reaction is generally carried out in under conditions appreciated in the art.</p><p>Additional amines, of the type where X.sub.2 is methylene, R.sub.4 is aryl, and R.sub.10 is aryl, heterocycle, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heterocycle, that are reacted in a manner analogous to Scheme I are prepared in accordance with Scheme V. ##STR14##</p><p>R.sub.5, R.sub.6, and R.sub.10 are as previously defined and X.sub.2 is methylene. (XVII) can be prepared by reacting 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol with excess (about 5 mol/equiv) of a compound of formula (XVIA) by methods well known in the art (see Sh. Prikl. Kin., Vol 45, 1573-77 (1972); Russ.). The reaction can also be carried out by mixing the reagents in an aprotic solvent, preferably diglyme, and adding potassium t-butoxide (0.5 mol/equiv.). The reaction is then heated to reflux and water removed. After removal of water is complete, generally about 2-8 hours depending upon the scale of the reaction, the resulting solution is subjected to a standard aqueous work-up and the product is isolated by crystallization or other purification technique known in the art. Compound (XVII) can be reduced by methods well known in the art. Compound (XVIII) is preferably prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding compound (XVII) over a precious metal catalyst. The hydrogenation can be affected at between about 20 and about 60 psi of hydrogen, and with a variety of solvents, temperatures, and catalysts well known in the art. The reaction is preferably carried out at about 50 psi of hydrogen over 5% palladium on carbon wetted with 2B3 ethanol. Compound (XVII) is charged to the reactor along with one equivalent of acetic acid, diluted with solvent, heated to about 50 depending on the scale of the reaction. The product is isolated as the acetic acid salt upon work up by methods well known in the art.</p><p>A skilled artisan would appreciate that compound (XVIII) could be coupled with a wide variety of aromatic halides to yield the ethers contemplated by the present invention. The coupling can be carried out according to procedures well known in the art and is preferably performed by mixing the starting materials in N,N-dimethylacetamide and toluene in the presence of potassium carbonate. The reaction is then heated to reflux for about 5 to about 24 hours and water removed. The product is isolated by standard techniques. The crude product can be purified by methods well know in the art. A skilled artisan would appreciate that the amines prepared by Scheme V can be utilized in Scheme I to prepare compounds of the present invention.</p><p>Additional amines capable of being utilized in Scheme I can be prepared according to Scheme IV or by methods known in the art. ##STR15## Compounds of formula XXI can be prepared by the addition of a nucleophile to the compounds of formula (XX) according to procedures well known in the art.

This pharmacological activity can be determined in the functional agonist Î².sub.3 assay.</p><heading>Functional Agonists Î².sub.3 Assay</heading><p>Cell Lines</p><p>The hÎ².sub.2 DNA was expressed from a plasmid 57537 obtained from American Type Culture Collection. hÎ².sub.1 and hÎ².sub.3 adrenergic receptors were cloned from human genomic libraries using the polymerase chain reaction method with degenerate probes. Full length receptors were cloned, expressed and sequenced to verify identity according to published sequences (hÎ².sub.1 : T. Frielle et. al. (1993) Molecular Pharmacology 44: 264-270). These receptors were then expressed in the DXB-11 variant of CHO cells using a vector restoring tetrahydrofolate reductase and hygromycin resistance. Rat Î².sub.3 receptor expressing CHO cell line is known in the art. Mol. Pharm., Vol 40, pp. 895-99 (1991). CHO cells were grown in 10% dialyzed FBS./high glucose DMEM/0.1% proline.</p><p>cAMP Assay</p><p>Cell membranes were harvested from the above cell line using hypotonic 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 20 Î¼g/mL leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF buffer with scraping followed by differential centrifugation. Membranes were incubated in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.2% BSA, 2.6 mM Mg, 0.8 mM ATP, 0.1 mM GTP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, creatine kinase 50 U/mL, 0.2 mM IBMX at 32 Agonists were added and incubation continued for 15 m. cAMP produced was assayed using a fluorescent tracer-immuno assay method.</p><p>Intact cell assays were performed using suspended cells removed from culture flasks by trypsin treatment. Cells were preincubated with 0.5 mM IBMX at 37 m. Incubation was stopped by heating suspension in boiling water. cAMP or cGMP in these and the soleus incubations were assayed by RIA (Amersham).</p><p>The compounds of the invention are agonists of the Î².sub.3 receptor. Isoproterenol is accepted in the art as a non-selective Î².sub.3 agonist and is widely used as a comparator in evaluating the activity of compounds. See Trends in Pharm. Sci. 15: 3 (1994). In the Î².sub.3 assay, the compounds demonstrated at least 30%, preferably 50% and most preferably over 85% of isoproterenol's response at a single dose of 50 mmol. Dose response titrations on the agonists described reveal EC.sub.50 values of &amp;lt;10 mM, preferably &amp;lt;1 mmol. In the functional assay, dose titration furnishes an EC.sub.50 for isoproterenol of 1.1.+-î5 Î¼M.</p><p>When screened against the Î².sub.1 and Î².sub.2 receptors in the functional assay, dose titration experiments indicate that greatly reduced or no receptor stimulation is observed with the compounds of the invention. This is defined by measuring the intrinsic activity (maximal response achieved) as compared to isoproterenol. The claimed compounds of Formula I are selective Î².sub.3 receptor agonists and have an intrinsic activity of &amp;lt;3% of isoproterenol's response.</p><p>As agonists of Î².sub.3, the compounds are useful in treating conditions in a mammal in which the Î².sub.3 receptor has been demonstrated to have a role in pathology. The preferred mammal is a human. The relationship between modulating the Î².sub.3 receptor and treatment of diseases, such Type II diabetes and obesity, is well established in the art. Other conditions recognized in the art include: gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal motility, asthma, and depression. Thus, the present compounds are useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, non-specific diarrhoea and dumping syndrome.</p><p>In treating non-human mammals, the compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing weight gain and/or improving the feed utilization efficiency and/or weight gain and/or improving the feed utilization efficiency and/or increasing lean body mass and/or decreasing birth mortality rate and increasing post/natal survival rate of livestock.</p><p>The compounds of Formula I are preferably formulated prior to administration. Therefore, yet another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula I and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.</p><p>The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention are prepared by known procedures using well-known and readily available ingredients. In making the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semisolid, or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosol (as a solid or in a liquid medium), soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.</p><p>Some examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient.</p><p>The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg, more usually about 0.5 mg to about 200 mg, of the active ingredient. However, it will be understood that the therapeutic dosage administered will be determined by the physician in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound to be administered and the chosen route of administration, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, topical, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes. For all indications, a typical daily dose will contain from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg of the active compound of this invention. Preferred daily doses will be about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, ideally about 0.1 to about 5 mg/kg. However, for topical administration a typical dosage is about 1 to about 500 mg compound per cm.sup.2 of an affected tissue. Preferably, the applied amount of compound will range from about 30 to about 300 mg/cm.sup.2, more preferably, from about 50 to about 200 mg/cm.sup.2, and, most preferably, from about 60 to about 100 mg/cm.sup.2.</p><p>The following formulation example is illustrative only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.</p><heading>Formulation 1</heading><p>Hard gelatin capsules are prepared using the following ingredients:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->______________________________________               Quantity                (mg/capsule)______________________________________Active Ingredient      25  starch, dried 425  magnesium stearate  10  Total 460 mg______________________________________</pre></p><p>The above ingredients are mixed and filled into hard gelatin capsules in 460 mg quantities.</p><p>The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification.
