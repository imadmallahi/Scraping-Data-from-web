When a cell surface receptor is activated by its ligand a signal is sent to the cell, depending upon the signal transduction pathway that is engaged, the signal can be inhibitory or activatory. For many receptor systems cellular activity is regulated by a balance between activatory signals and inhibitory signals. In some of these it is known that positive signals associated with the engagement of a cell surface receptor by its ligand are downmodulated or inhibited by negative signals sent by the engagement of a different cell surface receptor by its ligand.</p><p num="p0002">The biochemical mechanisms of these positive and negative signaling pathways have been studied for a number of known immune system receptor and ligand interactions. Many receptors that mediate positive signaling have cytoplasmic tails containing sites of tyrosine phosphatase phosphorylation known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM). A common mechanistic pathway for positive signaling involves the activation of tyrosine kinases which phosphorylate sites on the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors and on other signaling molecules. Once the receptors are phosphorylated, binding sites for signal transduction molecules are created which initiate the signaling pathways and activate the cell. The inhibitory pathways involve receptors having immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) which, like the ITAMs, are phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases. Receptors having these motifs are involved in inhibitory signaling because these motifs provide binding sites for tyrosine phosphatases which block signaling by removing tyrosine from activated receptors or signal transduction molecules. While many of the details of the activation and inhibitory mechanisms are unknown, it is clear that functional balance in the immune system depends upon opposing activatory and inhibitory signals.</p><p num="p0003">One example of immune system activity that is regulated by a balance of positive and negative signaling is B cell proliferation. The B cell antigen receptor is a B cell surface immunoglobulin which, when bound to antigen, mediates a positive signal leading to B cell proliferation. However, B cells also express Fcγ RIIb1, a low affinity IgG<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> receptor. When an antigen is part of an immune complex with soluble immunoglobulin, the immune complex can bind B cells by engaging both the B cell antigen receptor via the antigen and Fcγ RIIb1 via the soluble immunoglobulin. Co-engagement of the Fcγ RIIb1 with the B cell receptor complex downmodulates the activation signal and prevents B cell proliferation. Fcγ RIIb1 receptors contain TTIM motifs which are thought to deliver inhibitory signals to B cells via interaction of the ITIMs with tyrosine phosphatases upon co-engagement with B cell receptors.</p><p num="p0004">The cytolytic activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells is another example of immune system activity which is regulated by a balance between positive signals that initiate cell function and inhibitory signals which prevent the activity. The receptors that activate NK cytotoxic activity are not fully understood. However, if the target cells express cell-surface MHC class I antigens for which the NK cell has a specific receptor, the target cell is protected from NK killing. These specific receptors, known as Killer Inhibitory Receptors (KIRs) send a negative signal when engaged by their MHC ligand, downregulating NK cell cytotoxic activity.</p><p num="p0005">KIRs belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily or the C-type lectin family (see <nplcit id="ncit0001" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Lanier et al., Immunology Today 17:86-91,1996</text></nplcit>). Known human NK KIRs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and display differences and similarities in their extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. A cytoplasmic domain amino acid sequence common to many of the KIRs is an ITIM motif having the sequence YxxL/V. In some cases, it has been shown that phosphorylated ITIMs recruit tyrosine phosphatases which dephosphorylate molecules in the signal transduction pathway and prevent cell activation (see <nplcit id="ncit0002" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Burshtyn et al., Immunity 4:77-85, 1996</text></nplcit>). The KIRs commonly have two of these motifs spaced apart by 26 amino acids [YxxL/V(x)<sub>26</sub>YxxL/V]. At least two NK cell receptors, each specific for a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) C allele (an MHC class I molecule), exist as an inhibitory and an activatory receptor. These receptors are highly homologous in the extracellular portions, but have major differences in their transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions. One of the differences is the appearance of the ITIM motif in the inhibitory receptor and the lack of the ITIM motif in the activating receptor (see <nplcit id="ncit0003" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Biassoni et al., Journal. Exp. Med,183:645-650, 1996</text></nplcit>).</p><p num="p0006">An immunoreceptor expressed by mouse mast cells, gp49B 1, also a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is known to downregulate cell activation signals and contains a pair of ITIM motifs. gp49B1 shares a high degree of homology with human KIRs (<nplcit id="ncit0004" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Katz et al., Cell Biology, 93: 10809-10814, 1996</text></nplcit>). Mouse NK cells also express a family of immunoreceptors, the Ly49 family, which contain the ITIM motif and function in a manner similar to human KIRs. However, the Ly49 immunoreceptors have no structural homology with human KIRs and contain an extracellular C-type lectin domain,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> making them a member of the lectin superfamily of molecules (see <nplcit id="ncit0005" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Lanier et al., Immunology Today 17:86-91, 1996</text></nplcit>).</p><p num="p0007">Clearly, the immune system activatory and inhibitory signals mediated by opposing kinases and phosphatases are very important for maintaining balance in the immune system. Systems with a predominance of activatory signals will lead to autoimmunity and inflammation. Immune systems with a predominance of inhibitory signals are less able to challenge infected cells or cancer cells. Isolating new activatory or inhibitory receptors is highly desirable for studying the biological signal(s) transduced <i>via</i> the receptor. Additionally, identifying such molecules provides a means of regulating and treating diseased states associated with autoimmunity, inflammation and infection.</p><p num="p0008">For example engaging a newly discovered cell surface receptor having ITIM motifs with an agonistic antibody or ligand can be used to downregulate a cell function in disease states in which the immune system is overactive and excessive inflammation or immunopathology is present. On the other hand, using an antagonistic antibody specific to the receptor or a soluble form of the receptor can be used to block the interaction of the cell surface receptor with the receptor's ligand to activate the specific immune function in disease states associated with suppressed immune function. Conversely, since receptors lacking the ITIM motif send activatory signals once engaged as described above, the effect of antibodies and soluble receptors is the opposite of that just described.</p><heading><b><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="p0009">The present invention provides a new family of immunoreceptor molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, designated herein as the Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor (LIR) polypeptides.

The present invention encompasses isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding LIR polypeptides, and further encompasses isolated LIR polypeptides. Exemplary nucleic acids encoding LIR polypeptides according to the present invention include those nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 29, 31, 33, 35 and 37, and exemplary LIR polypeptide sequences are shown in SEQ ID NOS:2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38.</p><p num="p0015">The LIR polypeptide family members possess extracellular regions having immunoglobulin-like domains, placing the members in a new subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily. While the LIR family members are characterized as having very similar extracellular portions, the family includes three groups of polypeptides that are distinguishable by their transmembrane regions and their cytoplasmic regions. One group of the LIR polypeptides has a transmembrane region that includes a positively charged residue and a short cytoplasmic tail and a second group has a nonpolar transmembrane region and a long cytoplasmic tail. A third group includes polypeptides expressed as soluble proteins having no transmembrane region or cytoplasmic tail. One of the LIR proteins has characteristics of both groups one and two, and may represent a fourth group.

Some LIR polypeptides may contain more than four Ig-like domains. An Ig-like domain is a structural unit that has been identified in a wide variety of cellular proteins. Ig-like domains contain a common fold that forms a sandwich of two β sheets that is stabilized by a characteristic intrachain disulfide bond. Ig-like domains are readily recognizable by reference to a large body of knowledge concerning this structural entity (see, e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0016" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Williams and Barclay, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 6:381-405 (1988)</text></nplcit>). Typically, Ig-like domains contain about 100 amino acids, although the number of amino acids may vary, e.g., from about 85 to 105 amino acids. Molecules that exhibit Ig-like domains generally play a recognition role at the cell surface, often mediating cell-cell interactions in a variety of biological systems.</p><p num="p0017">LIR-P3G2 (SEQ ID NO:2) is expressed by a variety of cells and recognizes HLA-B44 molecules, HLA-A2 MHC molecules and the alleles described in Example 14. Another LIR family member, designated LIR-pbm8 (SEQ ID NO:9) is expressed by a variety of cells and also recognizes a number of MHC class I molecules. By analogy with known molecules, LIR-P3G2, LIR-pbm8 and LIR members have a role in immune recognition and self/nonself discrimination.</p><p num="p0018">Examples 1-3 below describe isolating cDNA encoding P3G2 (LIR-P3G2) and a substantially identical polypeptide designated 18A3 (LIR-18A3). Briefly, the LIR-P3G2 family member was isolated by first expressing UL18, a Class I MHC-like molecule and using UL18 to isolate and identify P3G2 and 18A3, which are closely related and probably are variants of the same gene, which is designated "LIR-1." The nucleotide sequences of the isolated P3G2 cDNA and 18A3 cDNA are presented in SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:3, respectively. The amino acid sequences encoded by the cDNA presented in SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:3 are presented in SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:4, respectively. The P3G2 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:2) has a predicted extracellular domain of 458 amino acids (1-458) including a signal peptide of 16 amino acids (amino acids 1-16); a transmembrane domain of 25 amino acids (amino acids 459-483)<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> and, a cytoplasmic domain of 167 amino acids (amino acids 484-650). The extracellular domain includes four immunoglobulin-like domains. Ig-like domain I includes approximately amino acids 17-118; Ig-like domain II includes approximately amino acids 119-220; Ig-like domain III includes approximately amino acids 221-318; and Ig-like domain IV includes approximately amino acids 319-419. Significantly, the cytoplasmic domain of this polypeptide includes four ITIM motifs, each having the consensus sequence of YxxL/V. The first ITIM motif pair is found at amino acids 533-536 and 562-565 and the second pair is found at amino acids 614-617 and 644-647. This feature is identical to the ITIM motifs found in KIRs except that KIRs contain only one pair of ITIM motifs.</p><p num="p0019">The 18A3 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:4) has a predicted extracellular region of 459 amino acids (1-459) including a signal peptide of 16 amino acids (amino acids 1-16); a transmembrane domain of 25 amino acids (amino acids 460-484) and a cytoplasmic domain of 168 amino acids (485-652). The 18A3 amino acids sequence (SEQ ID NO:4) is substantially identical to that of P3G2 (SEQ ID NO:2) except that 18A3 has two additional amino acids (at amino acid 438 and 552) and 18A3 possesses an isoleucine residue at amino acid 142 in contrast to a threonine residue for P3G2. Additionally, 18A3 has a serine residue at amino acid 155 and P3G2 has an isoleucine at 155. Finally, the 18A3 polypeptide has a glutamic acid at amino acid 627 and P3G2 has a lysine at 625 which is aligned with the 627 residue of the 18A3 polypeptide. The four ITIM motifs in the 18A3 cytoplasmic domain are at amino acids 534-537 and 564-567 and at 616-619 and 646-649. Glycosylation sites occur at the amino acid triplet Asn-X-Y, where X is any amino acid except Pro and Y is Ser or Thr. Thus, potential glycosylation sites on LIR-P3G2 occur at amino acids 140-142; 281-283; 302-304; and 341-343. Sites on LIR-18A3 are at 281-283; 302-304; and 341-343.

The nucleotide sequences (cDNA) of the isolated LIR family members are presented in SEQ ID NO:7 (designated pbm25, or LIR-4), SEQ ID NO:9 (designated pbm8, or LIR-2), SEQ ID NO:11 (designated pbm36-2, or LIR-6b), SEQ ID NO:13 (designated pbm36-4, or LIR-6a); SEQ ID NO:15 (designated pbmhh, or LIR-7); SEQ ID NO:17 (designated pbm2, or LIR-5), SEQ ID NO:19 (designated pbm17, or LIR-3) and SEQ ID NO:21 (designated pbmnew, or LIR-8). The amino acid sequences encoded thereby are presented in SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 20 and SEQ ID NO:22, respectively.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p num="p0021">Example 15 describes the isolation of LIR-9m1 (SEQ ID NOS:29, 30), LIR-9m2 (SEQ ID NO:31, 32), LIR-9s1 (SEQ ID NO:33, 34), and LIR-9s2 (SEQ ID NO:35, 36), which are four alternatively spliced variants of LIR-9, another new member of the LIR family. The first step in identifying these LIR-9 group of clones was the isolation of a short cDNA clone that was obtained from a human dendritic cell library and whose sequence analysis indicated that it had significant homology with the LIR family, particularly with the sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:11, 13 and 15. Using PCR primers based on this clone, further cloning efforts yielded four full-length cDNAs corresponding to LIR-9ml, -9m2, -9s1 and -9s2. LIR-9ml and LIR-9m2 are transmembrane proteins that differ by 12 amino acids that are found in the extracellular region of LIR-9m1, but that are absent from LIR9m2. These 12 amino acids correspond to amino acids 29-40 of SEQ ID NO:30. LIRs-9s1 and -9s2 do not contain a transmembrane domain, thus encode soluble versions of LIR-9. The LIR-9s1 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:34) includes the 12 amino acid insert that is present in LIR-9m1. Amino acids 1-238 of LIR-9s1 (SEQ ID NO:34) and LIR-9m1 (SEQ ID NO:30) are identical, but the remainder of the LIR-9s1 sequence is not identical to the corresponding region of LIR-9m1. Amino acids 1-226 of LIR-9s2 (SEQ ID NO:36) are identical to the first 226 amino acids of LIR-9m2 (SEQ ID NO:32), but the remaining amino acid sequence of LIR-9s2 diverges from that of LIR-9m2.</p><p num="p0022">The same PCR primers that were used to isolate the LIR-9 clones yielded an additional cloned LIR cDNA that has been designated LIR-10 (SEQ ID NOS:37 and 38). By comparing the nucleotide sequence of LIR-10 with the most closely related LIRs that were previously identified, i.e, with SEQ ID NOS: 13 and 15, it has been determined that the LIR-10 cDNA is an incomplete clone that lacks sequences located at the 5' end of the corresponding mRNA, including the 5' untranslated region, and nucleotides encoding the first 26 amino acids of the LIR-10 protein.</p><p num="p0023">The identified extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions for the polypeptides of LIR family members shown in SEQ ID NOS:10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38 are presented below.

One group includes the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS:12, 14, 16, 30 and 32, which are distinguishable by a charged arginine residue in their transmembrane regions and their short cytoplasmic regions. A second group includes SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 10, 18, 20 and 22 which are distinguishable by their<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> hydrophobic cytoplasmic domains and the presence of one or more ITIM motifs in their cytoplasmic regions. A third group includes the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 8, 34 and 36, which are expressed as soluble polypeptides and have no transmembrane or cytoplasmic regions. These soluble polypeptides may function to block the interactions of cell surface family members with their receptors. Alternatively, the soluble polypeptides may act as an activatory signal when bound to the receptor. Like the members of group one, LIR-10 has a relatively short cytoplasmic domain and a charged residue in its transmembrane domain, though its charged residue is histidine instead of arginine. However, LIR-10 also has an ITIM motif in its cytoplasmic domain, like the members of group two. Thus, LIR-10 has some of the characteristics of both groups one and two, and may represent a fourth group of LIR proteins. The LIR polypeptides are characterized generally by the ability of their encoding DNA to hybridize to DNA encoding the P3G2 extracellular region.</p><p num="p0034">The invention should be understood to encompass isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding LIR polypeptides having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38.

Several of the LIR isolates are closely related, thus must represent allelic variants or splicing variants. For example, the extracellular regions of SEQ ID NO:12 and SEQ ID NO: 14 share sequence homology which is close to 100%, thus indicating that these polypeptides derive from the same gene. In addition, SEQ ID NOS:2 and 4 share sequence homology that is in excess of 95%, thus probably represent two alleles of the same gene. Moreover, as discussed above, the extracellular regions of SEQ ID NOS:30, 32, 34 and 36 are nearly identical, thus indicting that these four proteins derive from mRNAs that are splicing variants.</p><p num="p0036">While sharing some structural similarities with other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the LIR family members have limited homology to other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Molecules having the closest structural similarity to the LIRs are the human KIRs and mouse gp49. However, LIR extracellular regions share only a 38-42% identity with the extracellular regions of NKAT3 and p58 CI-39, respectively. The extracellular regions of the LIR family members are only 35-47% homologous with that of mouse gp49. In contrast, KIRs in general are known to share at least a 80% amino acid identity, with NKAT3 and p58 CL-39 being 81% homologous. Additionally, none of the known KIR molecules has four extracellular immunoglobulin domains which is characteristic of all but two of the known LIR family<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> members.

One conserved region is a sequence of 46 amino acids found at amino acids 5-50 of SEQ ID NO:2. A data base search determined that the LIR family members differ substantially from the most structurally similar prior art polypeptides in this LIR conserved region. The data base search and structural analysis was performed using BLAST NB1, a local alignment search tool for searching data bases and aligning amino acid sequences to determine identities and variations in a given sequence. The BLAST NB1 software is accessible on the internet at http://www3.ncb1.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/blast. The BLAST NB1 search for sequences having homology to the sequence of amino acids 5 to 50 of SEQ ID NO:2 found that the most structurally similar proteins are FcγIIR, gp49B form 2, and gp49B form 1 having identities with amino acids 5 to 50 of SEQ ID NO:2 of 63%, 67%, and 67% respectively. This contrasts with an LIR family identity with amino acids 5 to 50 of SEQ ID NO:2 which ranges from about 71% to 100%. Specifically, LIR family members of the present invention contain conserved regions near their amino termini having the following identities with amino acids 5-50 of SEQ ID NO:2: SEQ ID NO:8 has a 96% identity; SEQ ID NO: 10 has a 90% identity; SEQ ID NO:12 has a 96% identity; SEQ ID NO:14 has a 91% identity; SEQ ID NO:16 has a 97 % identity; SEQ ID NO:18 has a 77% identity; SEQ ID NO:20 has an 80% identity; SEQ ID NO:22 has an 80% identity; SEQ ID NO:30 has a 78% identity; SEQ ID NO:32 has a 71% identity; SEQ ID NO:34 has a 78% identity; SEQ ID NO:36 has a 71% identity.

It is known that many immune regulating receptors such as KIRs, CD22, FcγRIIb1 also have ITIMs in their cytoplasmic domain and function to send inhibitory signals which down regulate or inhibit cell function. It has been shown that these receptors associate with SBP-1 phosphatase via binding to the TTIM motifs. Recruitment of the SHP-1 phosphatase by the receptor appears to be required for intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the inhibitory function of the receptors. The experiment described in Example 11 demonstrates that LIR-P3G2 and LIR-pbm8 polypeptides associate with SBP-1 phosphatase upon phosphorylation and generate inhibitory signals through monocyte activation pathways. It is known that many immune regulating receptors such as KIRs, CD22, FcγRIIb1 have ITIMs in their cytoplasmic domain and function to send inhibitory signals which down regulate or inhibit cell function. Thus, by analogy with KIRs, CD22 and FcγRIIb1, LIR family members presented in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 10, 18, 20, 22 and 38 that have ITIM motifs deliver an inhibitory signal via the interaction of its ITIM with SBP-1 tyrosine phosphatase, or other tyrosine phosphatases, when the LIR is coligated with an appropriate receptor. Also by analogy with immunoregulatory receptors possessing ITIMs, LIR family members have a regulatory influence on humoral, inflammatory and allergic responses.</p><p num="p0041">The LIR family members presented in SEQ ID NO:12, 14, 16, 30 and 32 have relatively short cytoplasmic domains, have transmembrane regions possessing at least one<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> charged residue, and do not possess the ITIM motif. By analogy with membrane proteins that lack ITIM motifs and have charged transmembrane regions, these family members mediate stimulatory or activatory signals to cells. For example, membrane bound proteins containing a charged residue in the transmembrane regions are known to associate with other membrane-bound proteins that possess cytoplasmic tails having motifs known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM). Upon association, the ITAMs become phosphorylated and propagate an activation signal.</p><p num="p0042">The LIR polypeptide designated LIR-P3G2 is expressed on the surface of transfected or normal cells. This is evidenced by the results of the experiments described in Example 3 and Example 5 in which flow cytometry and precipitation techniques demonstrate that LIR-P3G2 is found on monocytes, a subpopulation of NK cells, and B cells. P3G2 was detected on small subset of T cells. P3G2 is expressed as a 110-120 kDa glycoprotein. Since P3G2 has four potential glycosylation sites, the molecular size of this protein will vary with the degree of its glycosylation. Glycosylation sites occur at the amino acid triplet Asn-X-Y, where X is any amino acid except Pro and Y is Ser or Thr. Potential glycosylation sites on P3G2 occur at amino acids 139-141; 280-282; 302-304; and 340-342.</p><p num="p0043">P3G2-LIR isolated as described in Example 3 was tested for its ability to bind to cell surface ligands distinct from UL18. As demonstrated by the experimental results detailed in Example 7, P3G2 binds HLA-B 44 and HLA-A2, class I MHC antigens. Similarly, as demonstrated in Example 14, LIR-P3G2 and LIR-pbm8 bind to a variety of HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles and recognize a broad spectrum of MHC class I specificities. Since Class I MHC molecules play a central role in immune surveillance, self/non-self discrimination, the immune response to infection etc., the LIR-P3G2 and LIR-pbm8 polypeptides have a role in regulation of immune responses. It is known that NK cytolytic activity for killing tumor cells and cells infected with a virus is regulated by a delicate modulation of activatory and inhibitory signals. It has been shown that receptors specific for the same HLA class I molecules to which LIR-P3G2 and LIR-pbm8 bind may be activatory or inhibitory in their triggering mechanism. By analogy, LIR-P3G2 and LIR-pbm8, which bind MHC class I molecules, play a role in balancing immune system cell activity and are useful in treating disease states in which the immune system balance is disrupted.</p><p num="p0044">Within the scope of the present invention are polypeptides which include amino acid sequences encoded by DNA that hybridizes to LIR-P3G2 extracellular DNA probes under moderate to highly stringent conditions as taught herein.

Conditions of moderate stringency, as defined by Sambrook et al., include, for example, the use of a prewashing solution containing 5x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and hybridization conditions of about 55°C in 5x SSC, incubated overnight. Highly stringent conditions include higher temperatures of hybridization and washing. The skilled artisan will recognize that a given degree of stringency may be maintained while varying the hybridization or wash temperature or composition of the hybridization buffer in accord with formulae known to those in the art (e.g., see Sambrook et al., 9.50-9.51 and 11.45-11.47). Such formulae take into account factors such as the length of the probe, the G+C content of the probe, salt concentration of the hybridization buffer.

However, as explained above, one skilled in the art can devise other hybridization conditions that produce the same degree of stringency. Generally, stringent hybridization conditions involve a combination of buffer and incubation temperature that supports the formation of specific, i.e., well-matched duplexes while still allowing the formation of stable duplexes at an acceptable rate.

Soluble LIR polypeptides are capable of being secreted from the cells in which they are expressed. Advantageously, a heterologous signal peptide is fused to the N-terminus such that the soluble LIR is secreted upon expression.

In general, a number of approaches to conservative substitutions are well known in the art and can be applied in preparing variant of the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> present invention. For example, amino acids of the native polypeptide sequence may be substituted for amino acids which do not alter the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the LIR polypeptide. Other suitable substitutions include those which involve amino acids outside of the ligand-binding domain of interest. One approach to conservative amino acid substitutions involves replacing one or amino acids with those having similar physiochemical characteristics, e.g. substituting one aliphatic residue for another such as Ile, Val, Leu, or Ala for one another); substituting one polar residue for another (such as between Lys and Arg; Glu and Asp; or Gln and Asn); or substituting entire regions having similar hydrophobicity or hydrophilic characteristics.</p><p num="p0063">LIR polypeptide variants can be tested for binding to cells as described in Examples 5 and 6 and for phosphatase binding activity as described in Example 11 to confirm biological activity.

These LIR variants will not form intramolecular disulfide bridges upon renaturation. Naturally occurring LIR polypeptides selected for alteration by deleting or altering Cys residues preferably do not have biological activities which depend upon disulfide bridges formed by the Cys residue.

Heterobifunctional and homobifunctional linkers are available for this purpose from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Illinois, for example. Such linkers contain two functional groups (e.g., esters and/or maleimides) that will react with certain functional groups on amino acid side chains, thus linking one polypeptide to another.</p><p num="p0074">One type of peptide linker that may be employed in the present invention separates polypeptide domains by a distance sufficient to ensure that each domain properly folds into the secondary and tertiary structures necessary for the desired biological activity. The linker also should allow the extracellular portion to assume the proper spatial orientation to form the binding sites for ligands.</p><p num="p0075">Suitable peptide linkers are known in the art, and may be employed according to conventional techniques. Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US4751180A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patents 4,751,180</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US4935233A" status="new"><text>4,935,233</text></patcit>, which are hereby incorporated by reference. A peptide linker may be attached to LIR polypeptides by any of the conventional procedures used to<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> attach one polypeptide to another. The cross-linking reagents available from Pierce Chemical Company as described above are among those that may be employed. Amino acids having side chains reactive with such reagents may be included in the peptide linker, e.g., at the termini thereof. Preferably, a fusion proteins formed via a peptide linker are prepared by recombinant DNA technology.</p><p num="p0076">The fusion proteins of the present invention include constructs in which the C-terminal portion of one protein is fused to the linker which is fused to the N-terminal portion of another protein. Peptides linked in such a manner produce a single protein which retains the desired biological activities. The components of the fusion protein are listed in their order of occurrence (i.e., the N-terminal polypeptide is listed first, followed by the linker and then the C-terminal polypeptide).</p><p num="p0077">A DNA sequence encoding a fusion protein is constructed using recombinant DNA techniques to insert separate DNA fragments encoding the desired proteins into an appropriate expression vector. The 3' end of a DNA fragment encoding one protein is ligated (<i>via</i> the linker) to the 5' end of the DNA fragment encoding another protein with the reading frames of the sequences in phase to permit translation of the mRNA into a single biologically active fusion protein. A DNA sequence encoding an N-terminal signal sequence may be retained on the DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal polypeptide, while stop codons, which would prevent read-through to the second (C-terminal) DNA sequence, are eliminated. Conversely, a stop codon required to end translation is retained on the second DNA sequence. DNA encoding a signal sequence is preferably removed from the DNA sequence encoding the C-terminal polypeptide.</p><p num="p0078">A DNA sequence encoding a desired polypeptide linker may be inserted between, and in the same reading frame as, the DNA sequences encoding the two proteins using any suitable conventional technique. For example, a chemically synthesized oligonucleotide encoding the linker and containing appropriate restriction endonuclease cleavage sites may be ligated between the sequences encoding Fc and a P3G2 polypeptide.</p><p num="p0079">Within the scope of the present invention are recombinant expression vectors for expressing polypeptides of the LIR family, and host cells transformed with the expression vectors. Expression vectors of the invention include DNA that encodes a LIR family member operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory nucleotide sequences, such as those derived from a mammalian, microbial, viral, or insect gene. Examples of regulatory sequences include transcriptional promoters, operators, or enhancers, an mRNA ribosomal binding site, and appropriate sequences which control transcription and translation initiation and termination. Nucleotide sequences are operably linked when the regulatory sequence functionally relates to the LIR DNA sequence. Thus, a promoter nucleotide sequence is operably linked to a LIR DNA<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> sequence if the promoter nucleotide sequence controls the transcription of the LIR DNA sequence. An origin of replication that confers the ability to replicate in the desired host cells, and a selection gene by which transformants are identified, are generally incorporated in the expression vector.</p><p num="p0080">In addition, a sequence encoding an appropriate signal peptide can be incorporated into expression vectors. A DNA sequence for a signal peptide (secretory leader) may be fused in frame to the LIR sequence so that the LIR is initially translated as a fusion protein comprising the signal peptide.

Alternatively, an anion exchange resin can be employed, such as a resin matrix or resin substrate having pendant diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) groups.

With respect to monocytes, the expression of LIRs that are MHC class I binding proteins suggests that there is some requirement for monocytes to recognize MHC class I molecules. LIR-P3G2, LIR-pbm8 LIR and certain additional LIR family<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> members contain cytoplasmic ITIM motifs. By analogy with the structure and function of known MHC class I receptor molecules, these LIRs are inhibitory receptors mediating negative signaling. Indeed, the results demonstrated in Example 11 reveal that LIRS associate with SHP-1 and inhibit FcR-mediated activation events. Thus, monocytes may express class I receptors in order to suppress cell-mediated lytic mechanisms. Monocytes rapidly phagocytes extracellular pathogens via FcR and, monocyte-FcR engagement induces propagation of immune responses by producing more systemic mediators, particularly TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8. Thus, the LIRs play a role in monocyte and macrophage regulation of cytolytic and inflammatory responses against self tissues. The interplay between the FcR activatory signals and LIR inhibitory signal may allow low levels of self-reactive IgG to exist in circulation and bind to the monocyte membrane with initiating an immune response. For example, the expression of these inhibitory receptors can protect the developing embryo from maternal antibody-mediated allogeneic recognition.</p><p num="p0102">With respect to LIRs on cells of the DC lineage, as described in Example 13 CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup>HLADR<sup>+</sup> DC co-express LIR-P3G2 and LIR-pbm8.

Thus, LIRs expressed on DC may suppress DC activation through interactions of FcR.</p><p num="p0103">Many LIR family members lack the ITIM motif and by analogy with the structure and function of known MHC class I receptors lacking ITIMs are activatory receptors. Failure of a receptor that mediates negative signaling could result in autoimmune diseases. Thus, engaging an LIR family member having ITIM motifs with an agonistic antibody or ligand can be used to downregulate a cell function in disease states in which the immune system is overactive and excessive inflammation or immunopathology is present. On the other hand, using an antagonistic antibody specific to the ITIM possessing LIR receptor or a soluble form of the receptor can be used to block the interaction of the cell surface receptor with the receptor's ligand to activate the specific immune function in disease states associated with suppressed immune function. Since receptors lacking the ITIM motif send activatory signals once engaged as described above, failure of a receptor that mediates an activatory signal could result in suppressed immune function. Engaging the receptor with its agonistic antibody or ligand can be used to treat diseases associated with the suppressed immune function. Using an antagonistic antibody specific to the activatory LIR receptor or a soluble form of the receptor can be used to block the interaction of the activatory receptor with the receptor's ligand to downregulate the activatory signaling.<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --></p><p num="p0104">Since LIR-P3G2 binds to various cells, LIR-P3G2 may be used to purify or isolate these cells from heterogeneous preparations.

The cells were cultured for 2-3 days in 5% FBSDMEM/F12 (available from GIBCO), then washed twice with PBS, starved for 1 hour in cysteine/methionine depleted RPMI (available from GIBCO as RPMI 1640) and metabolically labeled with 100 µCi/mL of <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys for 4 hours.

In an effort to obtain an entire coding region, another round of RACE sequencing was performed, this time using a first primer from near the 5' end of the first RACE products, and a second primer corresponding to the 3' adapter. This effort yielded five clones containing LIR inserts, four of which are closely related and appear to encode variants of the same gene. These four closely related cDNA sequences were designated LIR-9m1, LIR-9m2, LIR-9s1 and LIR-9s2 (SEQ ID NOS:29, 31, 33 and 35). The fifth of the clones obtained using this last set of primers represented a different gene, which has been designated LIR-10 (SEQ ID NO:37).</p><p num="p0172">All four of the LIR-9 clones encode variants of the same protein, and are presumed to be the products of alternative splicing. The proteins encoded by LIR-9m1 (SEQ ID NO:30) and LIR-9s1 (SEQ ID NO:34) contain a 12 amino acid insert that is absent from LIR-9m2 (SEQ ID NO:32) and LIR-9s2 (SEQ ID NO:36). The soluble forms of the LIR-9 protein, i.e., LIR-9s1 and LIR-9s2, diverge near their carboxy termini from the membrane forms, i.e., LIRs-9m1 and -9m2. This divergence presumably is due to different exons being used by the soluble and membrane forms to encode that region of the protein.</p><heading><u style="single">Annex to the application documents
