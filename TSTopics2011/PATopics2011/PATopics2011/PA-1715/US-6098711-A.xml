Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relates generally to improved compositions and methods for sealing pipe in well bores, and more particularly, to such compositions and methods wherein the sealant hardens into a highly resilient solid mass having high bond strength.</p><p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p><p>Hydraulic cement compositions are commonly utilized as sealants in subterranean well construction and repair procedures. For example, hydraulic cement compositions are used in primary sealing operations whereby strings of pipe such as casing and liners are sealed in well bores. In performing primary cementing, a hydraulic cement composition is pumped into the annular space between the walls of the well bore and the exterior surfaces of pipe disposed therein. The cement composition is permitted to set in the annular space thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened substantially impermeable cement therein. The cement sheath is intended to support and position the pipe in the well bore and bond the exterior surfaces of the pipe to the walls of the well bore whereby the undesirable migration of fluids between zones or formations penetrated by the well bore is prevented.</p><p>Set hydraulic cement compositions are brittle solid masses which generally do not have sufficient resiliency to resist the loss of pipe and/or formation bond, cracking or shattering as a result of pipe movements caused by expansion, contraction, impacts or shocks. The bond loss, cracking or shattering of the set cement allows leakage of formation fluids through at least portions of the well bore by way of the annulus therein which can be highly detrimental.</p><p>Thus, there are needs for improved pipe sealing compositions and methods of sealing pipe in well bores whereby the hardened compositions are highly resilient solid masses having high bond strengths.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention provides improved sealing compositions and methods which meet the needs described above and overcome the deficiencies of the prior art. The compositions of this invention harden into highly resilient solid masses having high bond strengths which are capable of withstanding the effects of pipe movements. The compositions are basically comprised of an aqueous rubber latex present in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 90% by weight of the compositions, a rubber latex activator for causing the rubber latex to harden present in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the compositions, an organosilane compound for providing high bond strength to the compositions present in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to about 1% by weight of the compositions and a filler present in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 30% by weight of the compositions.</p><p>A preferred sealing composition of this invention is comprised of an aqueous rubber latex present in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 40% by weight of the composition, a rubber latex activator present in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the composition, an organosilane present in an amount in the range of from about 0.1% to about 1% by weight of the composition, an aqueous rubber latex stabilizing surfactant present in an amount in the range of from about 1% to about 5% by weight of the composition, a hydraulic cement present in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 40% by weight of the composition, an epoxy resin present in an amount in the range of from about 15% to about 30% by weight of the composition, an epoxide containing liquid present in an amount in the range of from about 2% to about 10% by weight of the composition, an epoxide hardening agent present in an amount in the range of from about 2% to about 10% by weight of the composition and a solid filler present in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 30% by weight of the composition.</p><p>While the sealing compositions of this invention can be utilized for sealing non-rusted pipe in well bores, they are particularly effective for sealing the more typical rusted pipe utilized in well bores by the oil industry.</p><p>The methods of this invention are basically comprised of the steps of preparing a sealing composition of this invention which hardens into a highly resilient solid mass having a high bond strength, placing the sealing composition in the annulus between pipe and the walls of a well bore and then allowing the sealing composition to harden into a solid mass.</p><p>It is, therefore, a general object of the present invention to provide improved compositions and methods for sealing pipe in well bores.</p><p>Other and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the description of preferred embodiments which follows.</p><heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p>As mentioned, the present invention provides improved compositions and methods for sealing pipe in well bores whereby the hardened sealing composition is a highly resistant solid mass having high bond strength which effectively withstands pipe movements due to expansion, contraction, impacts, shocks or the like. The compositions of this invention are basically comprised of an aqueous rubber latex, a rubber latex activator for causing the rubber latex to harden, an organosilane compound for providing high bond strength to the composition and a filler for providing rigidity to the composition which can be a hydraulic cement and/or a particulate solid filler such as crystalline silica (sand).</p><p>A more preferred composition of this invention is comprised of an aqueous rubber latex, a rubber latex activator, an organosilane compound, a rubber latex stabilizing surfactant, a hydraulic cement such as calcium aluminate cement, an epoxy resin, an epoxide containing liquid, an epoxide hardening agent and a particulate solid filler.</p><p>A variety of well known rubber materials which are commercially available in aqueous latex form, i.e., aqueous dispersions or emulsions, can be utilized in accordance with the present invention. For example, natural rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene) and most of its modified types can be utilized. Synthetic polymers of various types can also be used including nitrile rubber, ethylene-propylene rubbers (EPM and EPDM), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), butyl rubber, neoprene rubber, cis-1,4-polybutadiene rubber and blends thereof with natural rubber or styrene-butadiene rubber, high styrene resin, silicone rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber, crosslinked polyethylene rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, fluorocarbon rubber, fluorosilicone rubber, polyurethane rubber, polyacrylic rubber and polysulfide rubber.

The third monomer, when present, generally is anionic in character and includes a carboxylate, sulfate or sulfonate group. Other groups that may be present on the third monomer include phosphates, phosphonates or phenolics. Non-ionic groups which exhibit stearic effects and which contain long ethoxylate or hydrocarbon tails can also be present.</p><p>A particularly suitable and preferred styrene-butadiene aqueous latex contains water in an amount of about 50% by weight of the latex, and the weight ratio of styrene to butadiene in the latex is about 25%:75%.

The filler is generally present in the compositions in an amount in the range of from about 10% to about 30% by weight of the compositions.</p><p>In order to prevent the aqueous latex from prematurely coagulating and increasing the viscosity of the sealing compositions, an effective amount of a rubber latex stabilizing surfactant can be included in the compositions.

The resulting composition was placed into the annulus of a pipe assembly, i.e., a small pipe centered inside a larger pipe. Prior to the tests the outer surface of the small pipe and inner surface of the larger pipe were sandblasted to remove rust. The rubber latex composition was cured at 140 composition was determined by supporting the larger pipe and applying force to the small inner pipe. The shear bond strength is the total force applied divided by the bonded surface area which breaks.</p><p>A second rubber latex composition was prepared by mixing the above described aqueous styrene-butadiene latex with particulate crystalline silica, zinc oxide, a latex stabilizing surfactant, i.e., an ethoxylated alcohol sulfonate and calcium aluminum cement. The resulting composition was placed in the annulus of a second pipe assembly of the type described above and the shear bond strength of the hardened composition was determined as described above. Also, the compressive strengths of portions of the hardened compositions were determined in accordance with the procedure set forth in API Specification For Materials And Testing For Well Cements, API Specification 10, 5th Edition dated Jul. 1, 1990 of the American Petroleum Institute.</p><p>The components and amounts of the components in the compositions and the results of the tests are set forth in Table I below.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE I__________________________________________________________________________Compressive and Clean Pipe Surface Shear Bond Strength TestsSealing Composition Components Aqueous  Particulate                     Calcium                          ShearSealing Rubber      Zinc          Crystalline               Latex Aluminate                          Bond CompressiveComposition Latex.sup.1,      Oxide,          Silica,               Stabilizer.sup.2,                     Cement,                          Strength.sup.3,                               Strength,No.   grams      grams          grams               grams grams                          psi  psi__________________________________________________________________________1     350  6.5 325  --    --   0    322     300  6   225  15    75   0    71__________________________________________________________________________ .sup.1 Aqueous styrenebutadiene latex (25% styrene:75% butadiene by wt. and containing 50% by wt. water). .sup.2 ethoxylated alcohol sulfonate .sup.3 Pipe assembly surfaces cleaned by sand blasting.</pre></p><p>From Table I, it can be seen that the rubber latex compositions did not bond to the pipe assembly.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading><p>The shear bond tests described in Example 1 were repeated utilizing two sealing compositions of the present invention.
