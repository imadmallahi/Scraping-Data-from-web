Field of the Invention</p><p>This invention relates to radiodiagnostic reagents and peptides, and methods for producing labeled radiodiagnostic agents. Specifically, the invention relates to specific-binding peptides, methods and kits for making such peptides, and methods for using such peptides to image sites in a mammalian body labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) via a radiolabel-binding moiety which forms a complex with Tc-99m. In particular, the peptide reagents of the invention are covalently linked to a polyvalent linker moiety, so that the polyvalent linker moiety is covalently linked to a multiplicity of the specific-binding peptides, and the Tc-99m binding moieties are covalently linked to a plurality of the specific-binding peptides, the polyvalent linker moiety, or to both the specific-binding peptides and the polyvalent linker moiety.</p><p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p><p>In the field of nuclear medicine, certain pathological conditions are localized, or their extent is assessed, by detecting the distribution of small quantities of internally-administered radioactively labeled tracer compounds (called radiotracers or radiopharmaceuticals). Methods for detecting these radiopharmaceuticals are known generally as imaging or radioimaging methods.</p><p>In radioimaging, the radiolabel is a gamma-radiation emitting radionuclide and the radiotracer is located using a gamma-radiation detecting camera (this process is often referred to as gamma scintigraphy). The imaged site is detectable because the radiotracer is chosen either to localize at a pathological site (termed positive contrast) or, alternatively, the radiotracer is chosen specifically not to localize at such pathological sites (termed negative contrast).</p><p>A number of factors must be considered for optimal radioimaging in humans. To maximize the efficiency of detection, a radionuclide that emits gamma energy in the 100 to 200 keV range is preferred. To minimize the absorbed radiation dose to the patient, the physical half-life of the radionuclide should be as short as the imaging procedure will allow. To allow for examinations to be performed on any day and at any time of the day, it is advantageous to have a source of the radionuclide always available at the clinical site.</p><p>A variety of radionuclides are known to be useful for radioimaging, including .sup.67 Ga, .sup.99m Tc (Tc-99m), .sup.111 In, .sup.123 I, .sup.125 I, .sup.169 Yb or .sup.186 Re. Tc-99m is a preferred radionuclide because it emits gamma radiation at 140 keV, it has a physical half-life of 6 hours, and it is readily available on-site using a molybdenum-99/technetium-99m generator.</p><p>The sensitivity of imaging methods using radioactively-labeled peptides is much higher than other radiopharmaceuticals known in the art, since the specific binding of the radioactive peptide concentrates the radioactive signal over the area of interest. Small synthetic peptides that bind specifically to targets of interest may be advantageously used as the basis for radiotracers. This is because: 1. they may be synthesized chemically (as opposed to requiring their production in a biological system such as bacteria or mammalian cells, or their isolation from a biologically-derived substance such as a fragment of a protein); 2. they are small, hence non-target bound radiotracer is rapidly eliminated from the body, thereby reducing background (non-target) radioactivity and allowing good definition of the target; and 3. small peptides may be readily manipulated chemically to optimize their affinity for a particular binding site.</p><p>Small readily synthesized labeled peptide molecules are preferred as routinely-used radiopharmaceuticals. There is clearly a need for small synthetic labeled peptides that can be directly injected into a patient and will image pathological sites by localizing at such sites. Tc-99m labeled small synthetic peptides offer clear advantages as radiotracers for gamma scintigraphy, due to the properties of Tc-99m as a radionuclide for imaging and the utility of specific-binding small synthetic peptides as radiotracer molecules.</p><p>Radiolabeled peptides have been reported in the prior art.</p><p>Ege et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,832,940 teach radiolabeled peptides for imaging localized T-lymphocytes.</p><p>Olexa et al., 1982, European Patent Application No. 823017009 disclose a pharmaceutically acceptable radiolabeled peptide selected from Fragment E.sub.1 isolated from cross-linked fibrin, Fragment E.sub.2 isolated from cross-linked fibrin, and peptides having an amino acid sequence intermediate between Fragments E.sub.1 and E.sub.2.</p><p>Ranby et al., 1988, PCT/US88/02276 disclose a method for detecting fibrin deposits in an animal comprising covalently binding a radiolabeled compound to fibrin.</p><p>Hadley et al., 1988, PCT/US88/03318 disclose a method for detecting a fibrin-platelet clot in vivo comprising the steps of (a) administering to a patient a labeled attenuated thrombolytic protein, wherein the label is selectively attached to a portion of the thrombolytic protein other than the fibrin binding domain; and (b) detecting the pattern of distribution of the labeled thrombolytic protein in the patient.</p><p>Lees et al., 1989, PCT/US89/01854 teach radiolabeled peptides for arterial imaging.</p><p>Sobel, 1989, PCT/US89/02656 discloses a method to locate the position of one or more thrombi in an animal using radiolabeled, enzymatically inactive tissue plasminogen activator.</p><p>Stuttle, 1990, PCT/GB90/00933 discloses radioactively labeled peptides containing from 3 to 10 amino acids comprising the sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), capable of binding to an RGD binding site in vivo.</p><p>Maraganore et al., 1991, PCT/US90/04642 disclose a radiolabeled thrombus inhibitor comprising (a) a inhibitor moiety; (b) a linker moiety; and (c) and anion binding site moiety.</p><p>Rodwell et al., 1991, PCT/US91/03116 disclose conjugates of "molecular recognition units" with "effector domains".</p><p>Tubis et al., 1968, Int. J. Appl. Rad. Isot. 19: 835-840 describe labeling a peptide with technetium-99m.</p><p>Sundrehagen, 1983, Int. J. Appl. Rad. Isot. 34: 1003 describes labeling polypeptides with technetium-99m.</p><p>The use of chelating agents for radiolabeling polypeptides, and methods for labeling peptides and polypeptides with Tc-99m are known in the prior art and are disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 07/653,012, 07/807,062, 07/851,074, and 07/871,282, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p>Although optimal for radioimaging, the chemistry of Tc-99m has not been as thoroughly studied as the chemistry of other elements and for this reason methods of radiolabeling with technetium are not abundant. Tc-99m is normally obtained as Tc-99m pertechnetate (TcO.sub.4 ; technetium in the +7 oxidation state), usually from a molybdenum-99/technetium-99m generator. However, pertechnetate does not bind well to other compounds. Therefore, in order to radiolabel a peptide, Tc-99m pertechnetate must be converted to another form. Since technetium does not form a stable ion in aqueous solution, it must be held in such solutions in the form of a coordination complex that has sufficient kinetic and thermodynamic stability to prevent decomposition and resulting conversion of Tc-99m either to insoluble technetium dioxide or back to pertechnetate.</p><p>For the purpose of radiolabeling, it is particularly advantageous for the Tc-99m complex to be formed as a chelate in which all of the donor groups surrounding the technetium ion are provided by a single chelating ligand.

This isotope has a single photon energy of 140 keV and a radioactive half-life of about 6 hours, and is readily available from a .sup.99 Mo--.sup.99m Tc generator. Other radionuclides known in the prior art have effective half-lives which are much longer (for example, .sup.111 In, which has a half-life of 67.4 h) or are toxic (for example, .sup.125 I).</p><p>In the radiolabel binding moieties and peptides covalently linked to such moieties that contain a thiol covalently linked to a thiol protecting groups [(pgp).sup.S ] provided by the invention, the thiol-protecting groups may be the same or different and may be but are not limited to:</p><p>--CH.sub.2 -aryl (aryl is phenyl or alkyl or alkyloxy substituted phenyl);</p><p>--CH-(aryl).sub.2, (aryl is phenyl or alkyl or alkyloxy substituted phenyl);</p><p>--C-(aryl).sub.3, (aryl is phenyl or alkyl or alkyloxy substituted phenyl);</p><p>--CH.sub.2 -(4-methoxyphenyl);</p><p>--CH-(4-pyridyl)(phenyl).sub.2 ;</p><p>--C(CH.sub.3).sub.3 -9-phenylfluorenyl;</p><p>--CH.sub.2 NHCOR (R is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or aryl);</p><p>--CH.sub.2 --NHCOOR (R is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or aryl);</p><p>--CONHR (R is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or aryl);</p><p>--CH.sub.2 --S--CH.sub.2 -phenyl</p><p>Prefereed protecting groups have the formula --CH.sub.2 --NHCOR wherein R is a lower alkyl having 1 and 8 carbon atoms, phenyl or phenyl-substituted with lower alkyl, hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, carboxy, or lower alkoxycarbonyl. The most preferred protecting group is an acetamidomethyl group.</p><p>Polyvalent linking moieties are covalently linked to the specific peptides of the invention, the Tc-99m binding moieties, or both. Polyvalent linking moieties provided by the invention are comprised of at least 2 linker functional groups capable of covalently bonding to specific binding peptides or Tc-99m binding moieties. Such functional groups include but are not limited to primary and secondary amines, hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acid groups and thiol reactive groups. Polyvalent linking moieties are comprised of preferably at least three functional groups capable of being covalently linked to specific binding peptides or technetium-99m binding moieties. Preferred polyvalent linking moieties include amino acids such as lysine, homolysine, ornithine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid; linear and cyclic amines and polyamines; polycarboxylic acids; and activated thiols such as di- and tri-maleimides. Also preferred are embodiments wherein the polyvalent linking moieties comprise a multiplicity of polyvalent linking moieties covalently linked to form a branched polyvalent linking moiety. For the purposes of this invention, the term "branched" polyvalent linking moieties is intended to include but are not limited to polyvalent linking moieties having formula: ##STR6##</p><p>Peptides of the present invention can be chemically synthesized in vitro. Peptides of the present invention can generally advantageously be prepared on an amino acid synthesizer. The peptides of this invention can be synthesized wherein the radiolabel-binding moiety is covalently linked to the peptide during chemical synthesis in vitro, using techniques well known to those with skill in the art. Such peptides covalently-linked to the radiolabel-binding moiety during synthesis are advantageous because specific sites of covalent linkage can be determined.</p><p>Radiolabel binding moieties of the invention may be introduced into the target specific peptide during peptide synthesis. For embodiments [e.g., Pic-Gly-Cys(protecting group)-] comprising picolinic acid (Pic-), the radiolabel-binding moiety can be synthesized as the last (i.e., amino-terminal) residue in the synthesis. In addition, the picolinic acid-containing radiolabel-binding moiety may be covalently linked to the ε-amino group of lysine to give, for example, αN(Fmoc)-Lys-εN[Pic-Gly-Cys(protecting group)], which may be incorporated at any position in the peptide chain. This sequence is particularly advantageous as it affords an easy mode of incorporation into the target binding peptide.</p><p>Similarly, the picolylamine (Pica)-containing radiolabel-binding moiety [-Cys(protecting group)-Gly-Pica] can be prepared during peptide synthesis by including the sequence [-Cys(protecting group)-Gly-] at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide chain. Following cleavage of the peptide from the resin the carboxyl terminus of the peptide is activated and coupled to picolylamine. This synthetic route requires that reactive side-chain functionalities remain masked (protected) and do not react during the conjugation of the picolylamine.</p><p>Examples of small synthetic peptides containing the Pic-Gly-Cys-chelator are provided in the Examples hereinbelow. This invention provides for the incorporation of these chelators into virtually any peptide, resulting in a radiolabeled peptide having Tc-99m held as neutral complex.</p><p>This invention also provides specific-binding small synthetic peptides which incorporate bisamine bisthiol (BAT) chelators which may be labeled with Tc-99m, resulting in a radiolabeled peptide having Tc-99m held as neutral complex.</p><p>In forming a complex of radioactive technetium with the peptides of this invention, the technetium complex, preferably a salt of Tc-99m pertechnetate, is reacted with the peptides of this invention in the presence of a reducing agent. Preferred reducing agents are dithionite, stannous and ferrous ions; the most preferred reducing agent is stannous chloride. In an additional preferred embodiment, the reducing agent is a solid-phase reducing agent. Complexes and means for preparing such complexes are conveniently provided in a kit form comprising a sealed vial containing a predetermined quantity of a peptide of the invention to be labeled and a sufficient amount of reducing agent to label the peptide with Tc-99m. Alternatively, the complex may be formed by reacting a peptide of this invention with a preformed labile complex of technetium and another compound known as a transfer ligand. This process is known as ligand exchange and is well known to those skilled in the art. The labile complex may be formed using such transfer ligands as tartrate, citrate, gluconate or mannitol, for example. Among the Tc-99m pertechnetate salts useful with the present invention are included the alkali metal salts such as the sodium salt, or ammonium salts or lower alkyl ammonium salts.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a kit for preparing technetium-labeled peptides is provided. The peptides of the invention can be chemically synthesized using methods and means well-known to those with skill in the art and described hereinbelow. Peptides thus prepared are comprised of between 3 and 100 amino acid residues, and are covalently linked to a radiolabel-binding moiety wherein the radiolabel-binding moiety binds a radioisotope. An appropriate amount of the peptide is introduced into a vial containing a reducing agent, such as stannous chloride or a solid-phase reducing agent, in an amount sufficient to label the peptide with Tc-99m. An appropriate amount of a transfer ligand as described (such as tartrate, citrate, gluconate or mannitol, for example) can also be included. Technetium-labeled peptides according to the present invention can be prepared by the addition of an appropriate amount of Tc-99m or Tc-99m complex into the vials and reaction under conditions described in Example 3 hereinbelow.</p><p>Radioactively labeled peptides provided by the present invention are provided having a suitable amount of radioactivity. In forming Tc-99m radioactive complexes, it is generally preferred to form radioactive complexes in solutions containing radioactivity at concentrations of from about 0.01 millicurie (mCi) to 100 mCi per mL.</p><p>Technetium-labeled peptides provided by the present invention can be used for visualizing sites in a mammalian body. In accordance with this invention, the technetium-labeled peptides or neutral complexes thereof are administered in a single unit injectable dose. Any of the common carriers known to those with skill in the art, such as sterile saline solution or plasma, can be utilized after radiolabeling for preparing the injectable solution to diagnostically image various organs, tumors and the like in accordance with this invention. Generally, the unit dose to be administered has a radioactivity of about 0.01 mCi to about 100 mCi, preferably 1 mCi to 20 mCi. The solution to be injected at unit dosage is from about 0.01 mL to about 10 mL. After intravenous administration, imaging of the organ or tumor in vivo can take place in a matter of a few minutes. However, imaging can take place, if desired, in hours or even longer, after the radiolabeled peptide is injected into a patient. In most instances, a sufficient amount of the administered dose will accumulate in the area to be imaged within about 0.1 of an hour to permit the taking of scintiphotos. Any conventional method of scintigraphic imaging for diagnostic purposes can be utilized in accordance with this invention.</p><p>The technetium-labeled peptides and complexes provided by the invention may be administered intravenously in any conventional medium for intravenous injection such as an aqueous saline medium, or in blood plasma medium. Such medium may also contain conventional pharmaceutical adjunct materials such as, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts to adjust the osmotic pressure, buffers, preservatives and the like. Among the preferred media are normal saline and plasma.</p><p>The methods for making and labeling these compounds are more fully illustrated in the following Examples.

DMF was then removed in vacuo and the product purified by HPLC.</p><p>Where appropriate, BSME adducts were prepared by reacting single thiol-containing peptides (5 to 50 mg/mL in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8) with 0.5 molar equivalents of BMME (bis-maleimidomethylether) pre-dissolved in acetonitrile at room temperature for approximately 1 to 18 hours. The solution was concentrated and the product was product by HPLC.</p><p>Crude peptides were purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Delta Pak C18 column and gradient elution using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water modified with acetonitrile. Acetonitrile was evaporated from the eluted fractions which were then lyophilized. The identity of each product was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FABMS).</p><heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading><heading>A General Method for Radiolabeline with Tc-99m</heading><p>0.1 mg of a peptide prepared as in Example 2 was dissolved in 0.1 mL of water or 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH=5, 6 or 7.4). Tc-99m gluceptate was prepared by reconstituting a Glucoscan vial (E.I. DuPont de Nemours, Inc.) with 1.0 mL of Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate containing up to 200 mCi and allowed to stand for 15 minutes at room temperature. 25 μl of Tc-99m gluceptate was then added to the peptide and the reaction allowed to proceed at room temperature or at 100 and then filtered through a 0.2 μm filter.</p><p>The Tc-99m labeled peptide purity was determined by HPLC using the conditions described in the Footnotes in Table I. Radioactive components were detected by an in-line radiometric detector linked to an integrating recorder. Tc-99m gluceptate and Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate elute between 1 and 4 minutes under these conditions, whereas the Tc-99m labeled peptide eluted after a much greater amount of time.</p><p>The following Table illustrates successful Tc-99m labeling of peptides prepared according to Example 2 using the method described herein.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->__________________________________________________________________________                    FABMS                        Radiochemical                               HPLC                    MH.sup.+                        Yield (%)*                               R.sub.T (min)**__________________________________________________________________________(acetyl-F.sub.D PRPG).sub.2 KGGGCamide                    1613                        98.sup.2                               17.4(GPRVVERHQSA).sub.2 KC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm amide                    2986                        99.sup.3                               16.0[(GPRP).sub.2 K].sub.2 KC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm amide                    2437                        100.sup.3                               16.3 ##STR7##                3021                        ND     ND(CC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm GGRGDS).sub.3 -TSEA                    ND  82.sup.1                               10.4(GPRPC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm Camide).sub.3 -TSEA                    3189                        93.sup.1                               10.0(Pic.SC.sub.Acm SYNRGDSTCamide).sub.3 -TSEA                    4489                        99.sup.1                               10.4, 11.2(RALVDTLKGGC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm Camide).sub.3 -TSEA                    4998                        95.sup.2                               13.4, 13.7(GRGDFC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm Camide).sub.3 -TSEA                    3561                        ND     ND(Pic.GC.sub.Acm RALVDTLKFVTQAEGAKCamide).sub.3 -TSEA                    7244                        98.sup.4                               18.3, 19.0(acetyl-SYNRGDTC.sub.Acm GC.sub.Acm Camide).sub.2 -DMAB                    3087                        ND     ND__________________________________________________________________________ *Superscripts refer to the following labeling conditions: .sup.1 The peptide is dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and labeled at 100 .sup.2 The peptide is dissolved in water and labeled at room temperature. .sup.3 the peptide is dissolved in a 50:50 mixture comprising 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and absolute ethanol and labeled at 100 **HPLC methods (indicated by superscript after R.sub.T): general: solvent A = 0.1% CF3COOH/H.sub.2 O solvent B.sub.90 = 0.1% CF.sub.3 COOH/90% CH.sub.3 CN/H.sub.2 O solvent flow rate = 1 mL/min Vydak column = Vydak 218TP54 RP18, 5μ  analytical column with guard column Conditions: 100% A to 100% B.sub.90 in 10 min Singleletter abbreviations for amino acids can be found in G.
