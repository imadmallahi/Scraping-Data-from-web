The combination of alkyl phosphates and the specifically selected agents/acids, particularly when used in specifically defined ratios and in a defined pH range, has been found to significantly enhance mildness (measured by percent zein dissolution) of the surfactant system compared to use of alkyl phosphates alone or alkyl phosphates used in combination with different auxiliary agents/acids. The compositions also have good foaming ability, even at acidic conditions.</p><p num="p0002">Thousands of surfactants may be used in personal care/personal wash compositions. Among these are included sulfates, carboxylates, sulfonates etc. Formulators are constantly looking for surfactants or surfactant systems which are mild to the skin (measured for example by the percent zein dissolved by the surfactant, wherein the less zein which is solubilized, the milder is the surfactant considered).</p><p num="p0003">One surfactant system which is believed to be mild relative to others is a system comprising alkyl phosphate surfactants. Typically, alkyl phosphates are commercially<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> available as mixtures of mono- and di-alkyl esters, and it is common to quote the ratio of mono to dialkyl ester, designated as MAP/DAP (monoalkyl phosphate to di-alkyl phosphate) ratio. Monoalkyl esters are diacids and possess two equivalence points, corresponding successively to the formation of the mono and di-salt with increasing degree of neutralization. Dialkyl esters are monoacids and possess a single equivalence point which corresponds approximately with the formation of the mono-salt in the monoalkyl esters.</p><p num="p0004">Unexpectedly, the applicants have found that, when alkyl phosphates are blended with specific weak acid auxiliary agents (including specific weak acid auxiliary surfactants), particularly at defined ratios, the resulting systems are perceptibly more mild than the phosphate system alone. Compositions are also adequately foaming, even at the acidic pHs of the invention. Enhanced mildness is specific to conditions in which the alkyl phosphate is at least partially in the mono-salt form, while the auxiliary agent (e.g. alcohol, surfactant) is undissociated. Compositions of the invention may comprise those where phosphate surfactant is combined specifically with weak acid auxiliary surfactants. More broadly, the agents may be any weak acid, as defined, including alcohols, auxiliary surfactants and other agents with a donating hydrogen group.</p><p num="p0005"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US4139485A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,139,485 to Imokawa et al.</text></patcit> discloses the use of alkyl phosphate.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p num="p0006"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US6566408B" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,566,408 to Cotrell et al.</text></patcit> discloses compositions comprising alkyl ester salts and amphoteric surfactants.</p><p num="p0007"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4758376A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 4,758,376 to Hirota et al.</text></patcit> (Kao) discloses alkyl phosphate ester surfactants (e.g. mixtures of mono-and di-alkyl phosphates) which may be used with auxiliary agents (e.g. surfactants).

wherein said weak acid auxiliary agent has a pKa higher (i.e. is a weaker acid) than that of the first ionizing H+ (e.g. whether on the MAP to<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> yield a mono-salt before subsequent neutralization to the di-salt or on the DAP to yield a mono-salt without further neutralization since there is no further available hydrogen to deprotonate) on said alkyl phosphate ester salt compositions.</p><p num="p0013">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the chain length of the auxiliary agent/acid is substantially proximate (within +/- 4, preferably +/- 2 carbon chain lengths) to that of the chain length of the alkyl phosphate ester composition.

<ul list-style="bullet"><li>Figure 1 is a figure showing potentiometric titration (using 1 molar NaOH base titrant) of an alkyl phosphate ester formulation (MAP 20) with and without dodecanoic acid measured in 60/40 vol/vol ethanol/water. As seen, at the initial part of the titration curve, the data for MAP alone coincides with that of MAP and auxiliary acid (in this case a surfactant). In this low pH region, because MAP is a<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> stronger acid than lauric acid (the pKa for dissociation of the first proton of the MAP head group has been estimated to be about 2 in water) it will dissociate (releasing H+ to form the mono-salt) as titrant is added, while lauric acid (dodecanoic acid), a weaker acid, will tend to stay in non-salt, unneutralized form. As additional base is added, the base begins to neutralize the second acidic proton on MAP to form the di-salt and also now begins to form a salt of the auxiliary surfactant (sodium dodecanoate). While not possible to distinguish the latter two neutralization processes, it can be concluded from the MAP/auxiliary mixtures which are disclosed that a pH region exists in which the weak acid auxiliary agent is essentially unneutralized (not in salt form), while the MAP is partially to essentially all in the mono-salt form. For the case of dodecanoic acid, this pH range (at which it will stay unneutralized) extends up to about pH 5.5. It is believed that as long as the auxiliary is undissociated/unneutralized (at a pH between about the pKa of the first proton of phosphate head group and the pKa of the auxiliary agent) one will get "complexing" between the auxiliary agent (e.g. surfactant) and the alkyl phosphate. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this complex is less irritating to the skin than are the uncomplexed species; and</li><li>Figure 2 is a figure showing the potentiometric titration (using 1 molar NaOH base titrant) of an alkyl phosphate ester formulation (MAP 20) with and without dodecanol (i.e. weak acid auxiliary agent is an alcohol) measured in 60/40 vol/vol ethanol/water. For the case of dodecanol as an auxiliary agent, the pH range over which the MAP acid is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> largely in the mono-salt form and the auxiliary alcohol is essentially undissociated extends up until the formation of the MAP di-salt (in excess of pH 8). Thus for the case of dodecanol, we can expect complexation of MAP and an auxiliary agent (leading to less irritation by surfactant) over the pH range 3-8. In other words, the weaker the acid, the wider the pH range over which complexation can take place.</li></ul></p><p num="p0018">The present invention relates to personal care compositions (e.g. personal care bar or liquid compositions) comprising alkyl phosphate ester salt compositions (alkyl phosphate surfactants) used in combination with weak acid auxiliary agents to provide milder overall compositions. Mildness is measured by the percent of zein solubilized wherein the greater the amount of zein dissolved, the less "mild" is the surfactant. As indicated above, the differential in pKa between alkyl phosphate and weak acid auxiliary agent leads to formation of a complex believed to be less irritating than the uncomplexed species.</p><p num="p0019">More specifically, in preferred embodiments the compositions of the invention comprise 5 % to 85 % of a system comprising a surfactant system and weak acid auxiliary agent (wherein preferably greater than 50 % of said surfactant system comprises alkyl phosphate ester surfactant and auxiliary surfactant, if the weak acid auxiliary agent comprises surfactant); wherein the weak acid auxiliary agent has a higher pKa (is a weaker acid and will tend not to dissociate to form salt as easily) than the first ionizing H+ group in said alkyl phosphate ester compositions.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p num="p0020">While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in the pH window between when H+ will dissociate from the alkyl phosphate ester to form the salt (because it is a stronger acid) and the salt has not formed in the auxiliary agent (because it is a weaker acid and has not ionized), the alkyl phosphate ester salt will complex with the auxiliary agent. Because of this complexation, milder formulations are formed. Thus, the weaker the acid, the wider the pH window over which complexation can occur with the upper pH limit being the second pKa of the alkyl phosphate.</p><p num="p0021">This mechanism essentially repeats itself from any composition comprising alkyl phosphate ester surfactant and auxiliary agent wherein, as noted, the pKa of auxiliary agent is weaker than that of the first ionizing hydrogen on the alkyl phosphate ester composition. For a given auxiliary agent which meets this criteria, pKa above that of the first pKa for MAP, there will exist a definite pH range over which we expect MAP mono-salt/undissociated auxiliary complexation to occur. It is not possible to define specifically the pH where the complex forms since this region is defined by which auxiliary agent is used (i.e. by the pKa of the agent).</p><p num="p0022">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the chain length distribution (e.g. on the main carbon chain of the surfactant) of the auxiliary agent is substantially the same (with ±4, preferably ±2 carbon chain units) as the chain length distribution of the alkyl phosphate ester composition.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p num="p0023">In another embodiment, the molar ratio of alkyl phosphate ester to auxiliary agent is in the range of about 51:49 to 70:30, preferably 55:45 to 70:30 or preferably 55:45 to 65:35. Lower ratios of alkyl phosphate to auxiliary agent (below 50:50) are not preferred as inadequacies will arise in the areas of foam quality and quantity.</p><p num="p0024">As indicated, the personal product compositions of the invention, bar or liquid, are typically comprised by 5 % to 85 % of the composition. The exact compounds will vary depending on type of composition with liquid compositions typically comprising 10 % to 75 % by wt. surfactant system and bar compositions typically comprising 20 % to 85 % surfactants.</p><p num="p0025">If the auxiliary agent comprises weak acid surfactant, the alkyl phosphate ester surfactant and auxiliary surfactant together preferably will comprise greater than 40 %, preferably greater than 50 % (up to 100 %) of the surfactant system. Other than this, there is no real limitation as to which other surfactants, if any, could constitute the remainder of the surfactant system. That is, the other surfactants, if any, may comprise anionic, nonionic, amphoteric/zwitterionic and/or cationic surfactant and/or mixtures of any of these. These are the same surfactants as may comprise the auxiliary surfactant, if any, except they may have lower pKa since they need not complex.</p><p num="p0026">Stated differently, because different surfactants may have different pKa values, it is possible for some surfactants to be forming a complex with the phosphate surfactant (i.e.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> because the pH is low enough for the surfactant to still not have ionized; these are the surfactants which would be referred to as auxiliary surfactants, if any are present); while other surfactants (e.g. typically with lower pKa than the first) have ionized and will not complex. It is possible that none of the weak acid complexing auxiliary agent at all comprises surfactant, and that surfactant system may comprise only phosphate and other auxiliary agent.</p><p num="p0027">Among the anionic surfactants which may be used (whether complexing or not), if auxiliary agent comprises surfactant, are included aliphatic surfactants (e.g. non-limiting examples include C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>22</sub> alkane sulfonate or disulfonate, alkane sulfonate, hydroxy alkane sulfonate, alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonate); and aromatic sulfonate (e.g. alkyl benzene sulfonate).</p><p num="p0028">Also included are alkyl sulfates (e.g. C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18</sub> alkyl sulfate); alkyl ether sulfates; alkyl sulfosuccinates; alkyl and acyl taurates; alkyl and acyl sarcosinates; sulfoacetates, alkyl phosphates; phosphate esters; sulfoacetates; and acyl isethionates.</p><p num="p0029">Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, phosphonium and sulfonium compounds in which aliphatic radicals can be straight or branched chain and wherein at least one aliphatic substituent contains about 8 to about 18 carbons and at least one contains an anionic group, e.g. carboxyl, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate or phosphonate.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p num="p0030">Amphoteric surfactants include at least one acid group (e.g. sulfonic). They include quaternary nitrogen and may include quaternary amido acids as acid group. They also generally include an alkyl or alkenyl group of 7 to 18 carbons.</p><p num="p0031">Nonionic surfactants which may be used include reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen (for example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols) with alkylene oxide, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide. Examples include alkyl phenols-ethylene oxide condensates and condensation products of aliphatic (C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>) primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide. They may also be sugar amides and alkylpolyglycosides.</p><p num="p0032">Suitable cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium compounds such as, for example, alkyldimethyl ammonium halogenides.</p><p num="p0033">Some examples of surfactants which may be used in surfactant systems of the invention include sodium lauryl ether sulfate, alkylpolyglucosides, sodium lauryl sulfate, caprylamidopropyl betaine and sodium cocoylisethionate. As noted, however, there is theoretically no limit as to which surfactant or surfactant systems may be used. Further, as noted, there may be none used at all as the weak acid auxiliary agent may be completely a non-surfactant (e.g. alcohol or other molecule).</p><p num="p0034">As for the alkyl phosphate ester surfactant in the auxiliary agent system, the alkyl phosphate salts used in the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> invention are typically mixtures of mono- and di-alkyl ester (monoalkyl phosphate and dialkyl phosphate are also typically referred to as MAPs and DAPs). Typically, the salts are sold as a commercial composition and the composition will typically have a MAP/DAP ratio.

Preferably, the ratio of MAP/DAP is 80/20 or higher for optional solubility and foaming. The alkyl phosphate salts preferably have an average chain length of at least 10 as a shorter average chain length can lead to poor foaming. The upper average chain length is preferably 16, as longer lengths can lead to reduced solubility.</p><p num="p0035">A typical alkyl phosphate commercial composition is, for example MAP-20 from Kao Chemicals. Analysis of this sample by the applicants resulted in samples found to have MAP/DAF weight ratio of 78/22 and containing 4.4 % phosphoric acid. Exact ratios of MAP/DAP or phosphoric acid are not critical to the invention and should not be considered limiting in any way.</p><p num="p0036">Generally, alkyl phosphate ester salts include alkyl ether phosphate ester salts (i.e. polyoxyalkylene derivatives of the alkanols from which they are typically derived) as well as non-alkoxylated derivatives. Preferred alkyl phosphate ester salts are mixtures (as noted above) of compounds having formula (1) and (2):

As indicated this may include surfactants but may include alcohols and other molecules with available donating hydrogen. Typically these auxiliary agents will comprise an aliphatic group (e.g. a straight chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated, hydrocarbyl group) and a group with a donatible hydrogen (acid group).</p><p num="p0038">It has been estimated that the pKa in water for the dissociation of the first proton on the alkyl phosphate ester headgroup is about 2.0 (<nplcit id="ncit0001" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>J.

An accurately weighed sample of the MAP to be analyzed is dissolved at room temperature in 65:35 ethanol/water and titrated potentiometrically with NaOH. Although the MAP acid is soluble in ethanol, precipitation will occur at the early stages of the titration in this solvent.</p><p num="p0047">Similarly, water is a good solvent for the fully titrated MAP, but a poor one for the MAP acid. Two inflection points will be observed for the titration, at roughly pH 5.5 and 10.0. The monoester contributes to both potentiometric breaks, as does any phosphoric acid, but the diester contributes only to the first break. Thus a second equivalence point which is less than twice the first is an indication of diester impurity. To isolate the contribution of phosphoric acid, a second titration is done on another sample of as close as possible identical weight. After the first inflection point, sufficient silver nitrate is added<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> to precipitate all of the free phosphate ion. All soluble orthophosphates will form a characteristic yellow, silver phosphate precipitate with silver nitrate, according to:


         NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + 3 AgNO<sub>3</sub> = Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + NaNO<sub>3</sub> + 2 HNO<sub>3</sub></p><p num="p0048">Thus the solution pH will fall after adding the silver nitrate and a yellow precipitate will form, usually slowing the equilibration time of the pH electrode. The titration is continued until the usual second inflection point, which will be higher than that observed in the absence of silver nitrate because of the 3rd proton from phosphoric acid which is released as HNO<sub>3</sub>. Thus the difference between the second equivalence points with and without silver nitrate is the number of moles of residual phosphate. The difference between the first and second equivalencies (all without silver nitrate) equals the number of moles of monoester and phosphate - from which the monoester can be determined. Lastly, the first equivalence, minus the moles of monoester and phosphate, yields the moles of diester. With knowledge of the molecular weight of each species, the relative weight fractions can then be determined.</p><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLES</u></heading><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLE 1 - ZEIN</u></heading><p num="p0049">To show generally the degree of harshness or non-harshness of various anionic surfactants and/or blends of surfactants used in typical personal product compositions, the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> applicants measured and recorded the surfactants and/or blends and their Zein score as noted below.
