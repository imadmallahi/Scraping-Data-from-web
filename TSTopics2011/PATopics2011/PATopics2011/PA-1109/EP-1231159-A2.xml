oxygen in packages containing oxygen-sensitive products, in particular food
and beverage products.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Background of the Invention</u></b></heading><p num="0002">It is well known that limiting the exposure of oxygen-sensitive
products to oxygen maintains and enhances the quality and "shelf-life" of
the product. By limiting the oxygen exposure of oxygen sensitive products
in a packaging system, the quality of the product is maintained and
spoilage or damage due to oxygen contamination is avoided. In addition
such packaging also keeps the product in inventory longer, thereby
reducing costs incurred from waste and having to restock.</p><p num="0003">There are two main sources of oxygen contamination in a
package: the head space oxygen and ingress oxygen. The head space
oxygen is the oxygen remaining in the package after the product has been
sealed off within packaging materials. Ingress oxygen is the oxygen which
diffuses directly through the package walls or enters the package through
voids or holes in the package (particularly at the seals). Contamination by
head space oxygen occurs only when the package is initially sealed. By
contrast, the ingress oxygen enters the package slowly from the time the
package is sealed until it is opened by the consumer. Over time, a 
substantial amount of oxygen may enter the package as ingress oxygen.
It is therefore desirable to remove the relatively small amount of head
space oxygen quickly, before the high oxygen concentration can damage
or degrade the packaged product, and to remove ingress oxygen more
slowly but continuously while the package is on the shelf, to prevent a
significant buildup of oxygen over time. A package capable of quickly
removing head space oxygen and absorbing ingress oxygen over time
would provide significant protection for oxygen-sensitive products.</p><p num="0004">In the food packaging industry, several means for limiting
oxygen contamination in a packaged product have been developed. For
example, products may be packaged under a modified atmosphere (called
"modified atmosphere packaging" or MAP), or packaged in a vacuum. In
these techniques, reduced oxygen environments are employed in the
packaging process which reduce or eliminate contamination from head
space oxygen. However, MAP or vacuum packaging processes are costly
and do not prevent later contamination from ingress oxygen. In fact, a
package with a partial or full vacuum would likely increase the oxygen
permeation rate of the package walls.</p><p num="0005">In barrier film packaging processes, materials are used in the
package walls which physically prevent oxygen from entering the package
interior. Such processes, however, do not prevent contamination by head
space oxygen, or prevent ingress of oxygen from holes or voids in the
package seals. Furthermore, making a package wall completely
impermeable to oxygen is often prohibitive, for example, in increased cost
of materials and the unacceptably high weight and rigidity of the package.
Therefore, a commercially viable package will typically have some degree
of contamination from ingress oxygen.</p><p num="0006">Another means for limiting oxygen exposure in a package
involves incorporating an oxygen scavenger in the packaging structure. An
oxygen scavenger is a substance that consumes, depletes, or reduces the
amount of oxygen from a given environment. </p><p num="0007">For example, an oxygen scavenging material may be included
within the package cavity as a sachet. Insertion of sachets requires
additional operations in the packaging process, thus increasing cost and
production time. Sachets also take up space normally occupied by
product. And while sachets may be effective at scavenging head space
oxygen, they cannot stop ingress oxygen from entering the package and
contacting the product before being scavenged. Furthermore, the use of
sachets causes safety concerns, as the end-user may inadvertently
consume the sachet along with the packaged product.</p><p num="0008">Alternatively, an oxygen scavenger may be incorporated into
the packaging structure itself, for example by constructing the package
walls with an oxygen scavenging polymer. Previous packaging systems
incorporating oxygen scavenging materials use only one such material in
a given package, thus producing a package with homogeneous oxygen
scavenging properties.</p><p num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,875 to Speer et al. discloses oxygen
scavenger compositions comprising substituted or unsubstituted
ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon polymers and a transition metal
catalyst, which are activated on exposure to actinic radiation or an electron
beam. These compositions are used to construct food packaging material
with uniform oxygen scavenging properties.</p><p num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,815 to Cochran et al. discloses a package
wall comprising a single composition of an oxidizable polymer and a
transition metal catalyst. The polymer/catalyst composition acts as an
oxygen scavenger, and thus the package wall has homogeneous oxygen
scavenging properties.</p><p num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,554 of Speer et al. discloses an article
useful for packaging oxygen-sensitive products, which contains an
ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon polymer and a transition metal salt
catalyst. Again, a given article contains only a single polymer/catalyst 
composition, and thus the oxygen scavenging properties of the package
are homogeneous.</p><p num="0012">U.S. 5,776,361 to Katsumoto et al. discloses an oxygen
scavenging composition or system for use in packaging oxygen-sensitive
products, comprising at least one polyterpene and at least one catalyst.
These packages also employ a single polyterpene composition in a given
package, producing packages having homogeneous oxygen scavenging
properties.</p><p num="0013">The packages disclosed in the U.S. Patents listed above may
be engineered to have certain overall oxygen scavenging properties, so
that either (but not both) the head space oxygen or ingress oxygen is
optimally removed. Alternatively, materials with intermediate oxygen
scavenging properties may be used in a given package to simultaneously
combat both head space oxygen or ingress oxygen contamination, resulting
in the suboptimal removal of oxygen from either source. What is needed,
therefore, is a package with differential oxygen scavenging properties,
which allows for the effective removal of both head space and ingress
oxygen.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Definitions</u></b></heading><p num="0014"><b>"Head space oxygen"</b> is the oxygen remaining in the

for oxygen-sensitive products comprising at least two oxygen scavenging
materials with different oxygen scavenging properties. The oxygen
scavenging properties of each oxygen scavenging material include rate and
capacity. Either the rate, capacity, or both may differ between the oxygen
scavenging materials comprising the packages of the invention.</p><p num="0022">In one embodiment, the oxygen scavenging materials in the
package comprise at least one high rate material for absorbing head space
oxygen, and at least one low rate material for absorbing ingress oxygen.
Preferably, the high rate material has a rate that is significantly greater than
the rate of oxygen absorption by the packaged product, and a capacity
capable of consuming substantially all the oxygen in the head space. The 
low rate material preferably has a rate at least equal to the rate of oxygen
permeation rate of the package, and a capacity approximately equal to the
product of 1) the oxygen permeation rate of the package, 2) the total area
of the package, and 3) the expected shelf life of the package.</p><p num="0023">In another aspect, at least one high-rate oxygen scavenger
is arranged in the package so as to scavenge head space oxygen, and at
least one low-rate oxygen scavenger is arranged in the package so as to
scavenge ingress oxygen. In one embodiment, the package is in laminate
(i.e., multiple layer) form and comprises at least one layer of high rate
material for absorbing head space oxygen and at least one layer of low rate
material for absorbing ingress oxygen. Preferably, at least one layer of
high rate material is placed nearer to the internal void of the package (i.e.,
nearer to the product) than the low rate material, and at least one layer of
low rate material is placed nearer to the outside of the package than the
high rate material.</p><p num="0024">In another aspect of the invention, the packages may
comprise more than one high rate material and/or more than one low rate
material, in any arrangement which allows effective absorption of head
space and ingress oxygen.</p><p num="0025">Any adjustable-rate oxygen scavenging material may be used

differential oxygen scavenging properties. Suitable articles include, but are
not limited to, rigid containers, flexible packages, or combinations of both.
Typical rigid or semi-rigid articles include plastic, paper or cardboard
cartons or bottles such as juice containers, soft drink containers,
thermoformed trays or cups which have wall thicknesses in the range of
100 to 1000 micrometers. Typical flexible packages include those used to
package many food items, and may have thicknesses of 5 to 250
micrometers. Preferably, the walls of such articles comprise multiple layers
of material. The packaging articles may be used to package oxygen-sensitive
products; for example foods and beverages, pharmaceuticals,
oxygen sensitive medical products, and corrodible metals or products such
as electronic devices. Foods and beverages which are especially
susceptible to oxygen contamination include beers (especially lager beers), 
wines (especially white), fruit juices, carbonated soft drinks, fruits, nuts,
vegetables, meat products, baby foods, coffee, sauces, and dairy products.</p><p num="0031">The packages of the invention comprise at least two oxygen
scavenging materials wherein each material has different oxygen
scavenging properties. Either the rate, capacity, or both may differ
between the oxygen scavenging materials comprising the packages of the
invention. The different oxygen scavenging materials are chosen or
designed for their ability to mitigate oxygen contamination from different
sources, for example head space oxygen or ingress oxygen. Preferably, the
package comprises one or more high rate oxygen scavenging materials for
scavenging head space oxygen and one or more low rate oxygen
scavenging materials for scavenging ingress oxygen.</p><p num="0032">It is desirable to remove head space oxygen as quickly as
possible, to minimize damage or degradation of the packaged product. To
absorb oxygen from the head space, therefore, it is preferable to use a high
rate oxygen scavenging material which has an oxygen scavenging rate
significantly greater than the rate of oxygen absorption by the packaged
product. This is especially important in the food packaging industry, where
food or beverages exposed to oxygen may exhibit off-color, off-odor or off-taste
to the consumer.</p><p num="0033">As used herein, an oxygen scavenging material that produces
a rate significantly greater than that of the packaged product is one which
scavenges oxygen at a rate at least about 0.5X greater than the product,
preferably at least about 1X greater than the product, and most preferably
at least about 2X greater than the product. Particularly preferred high rate
materials scavenge oxygen at a rate between about 1.5X and about 10X
greater than the product, for example between about 2X and about 7X
greater than the product. Techniques to determine the rate of product
oxygen absorption are well-known in the art.</p><p num="0034">High rate materials with very high rates, <i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., greater than 10X
the scavenging rate of the packaged product, may be used. However, the 
cost of using such a material in the package may outweigh the benefits,
especially when the average consumer may be satisfied with the limited
product degradation that may take place using a high rate material with a
lesser scavenging rate. Thus, the balance between unit cost and the
amount of product degradation that a consumer will accept is another
consideration in choosing the scavenging rate of the high rate material
used.</p><p num="0035">Factors such as package size and configuration, the type and
amount of packaged product, the amount of oxygen expected to be trapped
in the head space, anticipated storage conditions, etc. may also influence
the chosen headspace oxygen scavenging rate. One of ordinary skill in the
art is familiar with these factors, and may readily take them into
consideration to choose a rate for the high rate material that will adequately
protect the packaged product from head space oxygen.</p><p num="0036">The rate of the high rate material may also be chosen without
reference to the product oxygen absorption rate. For example, an at least
50%, preferably an at least 90% reduction in headspace oxygen level in the
first 24 hours after packaging is suitable for use in the packages and
methods of the invention. Preferably, an oxygen scavenging material with
a rate that produces greater than about 90%, preferably greater than about
95%, and most preferably greater than about 99% reduction in headspace
oxygen level within a period of one week is used in the packages and
methods of the invention.</p><p num="0037">For example, an oxygen scavenging material useful in
absorbing head space oxygen may have a rate of at least about 30
cc/g/day, preferably between about 35 and 45 cc/g/day, and most
preferably at least about 55 cc/g/day.</p><p num="0038">The capacity of the oxygen scavenging material used to
remove head space oxygen must be at least great enough to consume
substantially all the oxygen expected to be contained within the head
space. As used herein, the capability to consume substantially all the head 
space oxygen means that at least about 90%, preferably at least about
95%, and most preferably at least about 99% of the oxygen contained in
the head space can be consumed by the oxygen scavenging material.</p><p num="0039">To remove ingress oxygen, it is desirable to use an oxygen
scavenging material with a low rate, preferably one which matches the rate
of ingress oxygen permeation of the package. Oxygen permeance of a
package can be estimated by techniques known in the art, for example as
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,636,815 of Cochran et al., the disclosure of
which is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p num="0040">Generally, oxygen permeance may be measured by
constructing a package or package wall with an inactive oxygen scavenging
material (e.g., an oxidizable polymer without a metal catalyst) and exposing
a defined area of the package to an oxygen pressure differential under
standard conditions of temperature and humidity. For example, a package
or package wall may be exposed to an essentially zero partial pressure of
oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>) on one side, and a pO<sub>2</sub> of 0.21 atmospheres on the other, at
23 °C and 50% humidity. The rate at which oxygen crosses the package
wall under these conditions may be used to estimate the rate of ingress
oxygen entry into the package on the shelf. The rate of the low rate
material needed to effectively scavenge ingress oxygen can therefore be
based on such a measure.</p><p num="0041">For example, if the oxygen permeance of a package is
measured at 1.5 cc/[m<sup>2</sup> atm day], the rate of the oxygen scavenging
material must be approximately equal to or greater than this value.
Preferably, the rate of the low rate material is at least equal to the oxygen
permeation rate.</p><p num="0042">The capacity of the low rate material can be represented as
the product of:
<sl><li>1) the oxygen permeation rate of the package (in
cc/[m<sup>2</sup> atm day]);</li><li>2) the total package area (in m<sup>2</sup>), and </li><li>3) the expected shelf-life of the package (in days).</li></sl></p><p num="0043">For example, if the if the oxygen permeance of a package is
measured at 1.5 cc/[m<sup>2</sup> atm day], the total package area is 0.3 m<sup>2</sup> and the
package is expected to spend an average of 8 days on the shelf, the
capacity of the low rate material should be approximately 3.6 cc oxygen.</p><p num="0044">Generally, the rate required for high rate materials (head
space oxygen scavengers) will be greater than that required for low rate
materials (ingress oxygen scavengers). It is understood, however, that
there may be some overlap in the rates of high and low rate oxygen
scavenging materials used to absorb the head space and ingress oxygen,
respectively.</p><p num="0045">The rate and capacity of oxygen scavenging materials useful
in the invention may be determined by techniques well-known in the art.
For example, the oxygen scavenging properties of a material may be
measured by hermetically sealing a defined amount of the material into a
container having a known amount of oxygen, for example as described in
Example 7 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,815, Example 2 of U.S. Pat. No.
5,211,875 or Examples 30 - 31 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,616, the disclosures
of which are herein incorporated by reference. The depletion of oxygen
over time is followed until the oxygen level in the container remains
constant, at which time it is assumed the oxygen scavenging material can
consume no more oxygen. The rate is determined by calculating the
amount of oxygen removed from the environment of the sealed container
per unit time for a given mass of oxygen scavenging material. The capacity
is determined by subtracting the oxygen level at the end of the test from the
beginning oxygen level. Other equally effective methods of determining
rate and capacity may also be used.</p><p num="0046">The different oxygen scavenging materials are preferably
arranged within the package so as to most effectively remove oxygen from
a particular source. For example, a high rate material may be placed so as
to primarily scavenge the head space oxygen, and a low rate material may 
be placed so as to primarily scavenge the ingress oxygen. The most
effective placement of oxygen scavenging materials in a package depends
on the package configuration (e.g., surface area-to-volume ratio), product
type, packaging conditions, anticipated storage conditions, and other such
factors. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art is able to ascertain the best
placement of the oxygen scavenging materials in the package.</p><p num="0047">A useful placement of the different oxygen scavenging
materials in the package is a multilayer or "laminate" arrangement, in which
the package comprises at least one layer of high rate material and at least
one layer of low rate material. Preferably, layers of high rate material are
placed nearer to the internal void of the package than the low rate material
layers, and layers of low rate material are placed nearer to the outside of
the package than the high rate material layers. Another useful placement
of the different oxygen scavenging materials in the package is a "block"
arrangement, where entire sections of the package are formed primarily
from high or low rate materials. For example, if the package is to be stored
upright, the top portion of the package, preferably the top 1/4 to 1/3, may
comprise a high rate material. The remainder of the package may
comprise a low rate material. The laminate arrangement is preferred.</p><p num="0048">A package may also comprise more than one high rate
material and/or more than one low rate material, in any arrangement which
allows effective absorption of head space and ingress oxygen. For
example, if a package is expected to encounter low temperatures in
shipping, the package may comprise two separate sets of high and low rate
oxygen scavenging materials; one set of high and low rate materials that
are effective oxygen scavengers at high temperatures (e.g., above 10 °C),
and one set of high and low rate materials that are effective scavengers at
low temperatures (e.g., below 10 °C). Examples of oxygen scavenging
materials that are effective at low temperatures are found in U.S. Pat. No.
5,310,497 of Ve Speer et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein
by reference in its entirety. It is not necessary that the different high (or 
low) rate materials have identical rates and capacities, as long as the rates
and capacities of each are appropriate for the material's intended use (i.e.,
the absorb head space or ingress oxygen, as described above).</p><p num="0049">Any adjustable-rate oxygen scavenging material may be used
in the packages of the invention and it is within the skill in the art to choose
two or more such oxygen scavenging materials with appropriate rates and
capacities for a particular package and product. For example, in packaging
processes which incorporate a significant amount of head space oxygen,
the amount of high rate material in the package may be increased
accordingly. For products which are expected to spend much time in transit
or on the shelf before reaching the consumer, the amount of low rate
material in the package may be increased. It is understood that the oxygen
scavenging properties of a given package may also be adjusted by holding
the amount of oxygen scavenging material constant and varying the
chemical composition of the material to attain the desired rates and
capacities.</p><p num="0050">Suitable oxygen scavenging materials are well-known to
those skilled in the art, and include compositions of one or more oxidizable
organic polymers in the presence of a metal catalyst. The oxygen
scavenging properties of certain oxidizable polymer/catalyst compositions
are activated upon exposure to actinic (e.g., ultra violet or visible light) or
electron beam radiation; <i>see,</i> for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,981,676 of
Gauthier et al., 5,776,361 of Katsumoto et al. and 5,736,616 of Ching et al.,
the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their
entirety. Radiation-activatable compositions of oxidizable organic polymers
and metal catalysts are preferred.</p><p num="0051">Oxidizable organic polymers suitable for use in radiation
activatable, oxygen scavenging compositions are well-known in the art, and
include substituted or unsubstituted ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons
and mixtures thereof, such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene, and styrene-butadiene
block copolymers, as well as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 
5,211,875 and 5,346,644 to Speer et al. (the disclosures of which are
hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety) and 5,981,676 to
Gauthier et al., <i>supra.</i> Other suitable oxidizable organic polymers include
polyterpenes as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,361 <i>supra;</i> poly(metaxylenediamine-adipic
acid) (also known as MXD6); acrylates which can be
prepared by transesterification of poly(ethylene-methyl acrylate), such as
poly(ethylene-methyl acrylate-benzyl acrylate), poly(ethylene-methyl
acrylate-tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate), poly(ethylene-methyl acrylate-nopolacrylate)
and mixtures thereof, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
5,627,239, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in
its entirety, and polyethylenic compounds with pendant orterminal moieties
comprising benzylic, allylic, or ether-containing radicals as disclosed in US
5,736,616 <i>supra.</i> Mixtures of two or more oxidizable polymers may also be
used. Particularly preferred oxidizable polymers are substituted or
unsubstituted ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons, polyvinylidene
chloride and polyethylenic compounds with pendant 3-cyclohexenyl
moieties such as ethylene-cyclohexenylmethyl acrylate copolymer (ECHA)
or ethylene-methylacrylate-cyclohexeneylmethyl acrylate terpolymer
(EMCM).</p><p num="0052">Metal catalysts are also well-known in the art, and include
transition metal catalysts which can readily interconvert between at least
two oxidation states. The transition metal catalyst may also be in the form
of a transition metal salt. The oxidation state of the transition metal in the
catalyst, when mixed with the oxidizable polymer, is not necessarily that of
the active form. Suitable transition metal catalysts comprise transition
metals selected from the first, second or third transition series of the
periodic table of the elements, and include manganese II or III, iron II or III,
cobalt II or III, nickel II or III, copper I or II, rhodium II, III or IV, and
ruthenium. The transition metal is preferably iron, nickel or copper, more
preferably manganese and most preferably cobalt. Suitable counterions
for the metal include chloride, acetate, stearate, palmitate, 2-ethylhexanoate, 
neodecanoate or naphthenate. Particularly preferable
transition metal salts include cobalt (II) 2-ethylhexanoate and cobalt (II)
neodecanoate. The transition metal salt may also be an ionomer, in which
case a polymeric counterion is employed. Such ionomers are well known
in the art.</p><p num="0053">The oxidizable polymer/catalyst compositions may further
comprise one or more non-oxygen scavenger diluent polymers known to be
useful in packaging film forming materials. Generally, these polymers are
semi-crystalline materials that are thermoplastic and render the oxygen
scavenging film more adaptable for use as packaging layers. Suitable
diluent polymers include polyethylene, low density polyethylene, very low
density polyethylene, ultra-low density polyethylene, high density
polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride, and
ethylene copolymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate, ethylene-alkyl
(meth)acrylates, ethylene(meth)-acrylic acid and ethylene-(meth)acrylic
acid ionomers. In rigid articles such as beverage containers, PET is often
used. Blends of different diluent polymers may also be used. The
selection of the polymeric diluent largely depends on the packaging article
to be manufactured and its intended use. Such selection factors are well
known in the art. For instance, certain polymers are known to provide
clarity, cleanliness, barrier properties, mechanical properties and/ortexture
to the resultant article.</p><p num="0054">Photoinitiators may optionally be added to the oxidizable
polymer/catalyst composition, to decrease the activation time of the metal
catalyst. Such photoinitiators are well known in the art, and are disclosed,
for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,676, <i>supra.</i> Preferred are low-migratory
photoinitiators such as are disclosed in WO 98/5179 and US 6,139,770, the
disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.
A particularly preferred low-migratory photoinitiator is tribenzoyl
triphenylbenzene (BBP<sup>3</sup>). </p><p num="0055">Further additives may optionally be included in the oxidizable
polymer/catalyst composition to impart properties desired for the particular
article being manufactured. Such additives are well-known in the art and
include fillers, pigments, dyestuffs, antioxidants, stabilizers, processing
aids, plasticizers, fire retardants, anti-fog agents, etc. Preferably, these
additives do not comprise more than 10% of the scavenging component,
with amounts of additives being most preferably less than 5% by weight of
the scavenging component.</p><p num="0056">The mixing of the oxidizable polymers, catalysts and other
components listed above is preferably accomplished by melt-blending at a
temperature in the range of 50 °C to 300 °C. However, alternative blending
techniques within the skill in the art, such as the use of a solvent followed
by evaporation, may also be employed. The blending may immediately
precede the formation of the finished article or preform, or precede the
formation of a feedstock or masterbatch for later use in the production of
finished packaging articles. When making film layers or articles from
oxygen-scavenging compositions, (co)extrusion, solvent casting, injection
molding, stretch blow molding, orientation, thermoforming, extrusion
coating, coating and curing, lamination or combinations thereof may follow
the blending.</p><p num="0057">For oxygen scavenging materials comprising a radiation-activated
composition of an oxidizable polymer and a metal catalyst, the
oxygen scavenging properties depend primarily on the relative amounts of
oxidizable polymer and catalyst. The primary function of the oxidizable
polymer is to react irreversibly with oxygen during the scavenging process,
and the primary function of the catalyst is to facilitate the irreversible
reaction of oxygen with the polymer. Therefore, capacity is directly
proportional to the amount of oxidizable polymer in the composition, and
rate is directly proportional to the amount of catalyst in the composition. It
is within the skill in the art to vary the polymer/catalyst ratio to produce an
oxygen scavenging material with a desired capacity and rate. Typically, the 
amount of oxidizable polymer may range from 1 to 99%, preferably from 10
to 99%, by weight of the composition and the amount of catalyst may range
from 0.001 to 1% (10 to 10,000 ppm) of the scavenging component, based
on the metal content only (excluding ligands, counterions, etc.). If one or
more diluent polymers are used, those polymers may comprise, in total, as
much as 99% by weight of the scavenging component. In the event the
amount of catalyst is about 0.5% or less, it follows that the oxidizable
polymer optionally together with other components will comprise
substantially all of the composition. Preferred high rate compositions are
those with a polymer/catalyst ratio of 3:1 or 9:2, and preferred low rate
compositions are those with a polymer/catalyst ratio of 9:1.</p><p num="0058">The oxygen scavenging material may be used in flexible or
rigid single layer or multilayer articles. The layers comprising the oxygen
scavenging material may be in any useful form; for example, stock films,
including "oriented" or "heat shrinkable" films, which may ultimately be
processed as bags or other flexible packages. The layers of oxygen
scavenging material may also be in the form of sheet inserts to be placed
in a packaging cavity. In rigid articles such as beverage containers and
thermoformed trays or cups, the layer of oxygen scavenging material may
be within the container walls or in the form of a liner placed with or in the
container lid or cap. The oxygen scavenging material layer may also be
coated or laminated onto any one of the articles mentioned above, or
coated onto a solid support, such as a polymeric (i.e., polyester) film. For
example, a preferred oxygen scavenging material comprises polyvinylidene
chloride-coated polyester film and a cobalt (II) neodecanoate catalyst.</p><p num="0059">Multilayered articles of the invention may also comprise one
or more oxygen barriers; i.e., layers of material having an oxygen
transmission rate equal to or less than 500 cubic centimeters per square
meter (cc/m<sup>2</sup>) per day per atmosphere at room temperature (i.e., about 25
°C). Typical oxygen barriers are well-known in the art, and may comprise,
for example, poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol), polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl 
chloride, poly(vinylidene dichloride), polyethylene terephthalate, silica, and
polyamides. Copolymers of certain materials described above, metal foil
layers, Metallized films, silicon and aluminum oxide coated films, liquid
crystal polymer layers, and layers of nano-composites may also be
employed as oxygen barriers.</p><p num="0060">Multilayered articles of the invention may also comprise one
or more layers which are permeable to oxygen, for example layers
comprising styrene-butadiene copolymers; polystyrenes, including
substituted polystyrenes (e.g., with oligosiloxane, -silane, -germanosiloxane,
-germane, or -stannane as p-substituents); ethylene/alpha-olefin
copolymers, polyethylene-polypropylene copolymers and other materials
well-known in the art.</p><p num="0061">The layers used to construct the multilayered articles of the
invention may be prepared using techniques well-known in the art, such as
coextrusion, coating and/or lamination. In addition to oxygen barrier and
oxygen permeable layers, further layers (such as adhesive layers) may be
adjacent to any of the layers discussed above. Compositions suitable for
adhesive layers include those well-known in the art, such as anhydride
functional polyolefins.</p><p num="0062">Multilayer dual oxygen scavenging films comprising at least
one layer of high rate material and at least one layer of low rate material,
optionally together with other layers, are considered part of the invention.
An exemplary multilayer dual oxygen scavenging film is given in Example
1 below. Methods of constructing packages having differential oxygen
scavenging properties with such films are also provided, which methods
comprise providing a film comprising at least one layer of high rate material
and at least one layer of low rate material, optionally together with one or
more other layers, and forming the film into a package.</p><p num="0063">In one embodiment, there is provided a multilayered flexible
package for food or beverages comprising at least two layers. The layer
closest to the inner void of the package may comprise a high rate oxygen 
scavenging material for scavenging head space oxygen, for example an
oxidizable polymer/transition metal catalyst composition. The layer closest
to the outside of the package may comprise a low rate oxygen scavenging
material for scavenging ingress oxygen, for example an oxidizable
polymer/transition metal catalyst composition with a low rate, wherein the
rate matches the rate of ingress oxygen migration. Other barrier and
sealant layers may be present as necessary for the particular application.</p><p num="0064">An exemplary package wall configuration for a multilayer
package is shown in Fig. <b>1</b>, which is a cross-section through the package
wall. With reference to Fig. <b>1</b>, the package wall may comprise the following
layers, beginning with the layer closest to the product: an inner sealant
layer <b>1</b>; a first scavenging layer <b>2</b> having a 9:2 oxidizable polymer/metal
catalyst ratio for a high absorption rate overlaying the inner sealant layer;
a "tie layer" <b>3</b> optionally present in between the inner sealant layer and first
scavenging layers to bind these layers together; a second scavenging layer
<b>4</b> having a 9:1 polymer catalyst ratio for a low absorption rate overlaying
the first scavenging layer; and optionally an outer sealant layer <b>5</b> overlaying
the second scavenging layer. The oxygen scavenging layers preferably
comprise commercially available, UV-activated oxygen scavenging
polymer/catalyst compositions, in particular polyvinylidene chloride-coated
polyester films employing a cobalt metal salt catalyst, such as the
"OS1000" oxygen scavenger marketed by Cryovac - Sealed Air Corp. of
Simpsonville, SC, and more preferably comprise compositions of ethylene-cyclohexenylmethyl
acrylate copolymer (ECHA) or ethylene-methylacrylate-cyclohexeneylmethyl
