However, common non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are active in reducing the prostaglandin-induced pain and swelling associated with the inflammation process are also active in affecting other prostaglandin-regulated processes not associated with the inflammation process. Thus, use of high doses of most common NSAIDs can produce severe side effects, including life threatening ulcers, that limit their therapeutic potential. An alternative to NSAIDs is the use of corticosteroids, which have even more drastic side effects, especially when long term therapy is involved.</p><p>Previous NSAIDs have been found to prevent the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting enzymes in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway, including the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). The recent discovery of an inducible enzyme associated with inflammation (named "cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)" or "prostaglandin G/H synthase II") provides a viable target of inhibition which more effectively reduces inflammation and produces fewer and less drastic side effects.</p><p>The references below that disclose antiinflammatory activity, show continuing efforts to find a safe and effective antiinflammatory agent. The novel benzopyran, dihydroquinoline, benzothiopyran and dihydronapthalene derivatives disclosed herein are such safe and also effective antiinflammatory agents furthering such efforts. The substituted benzopyran, dihydroquinoline, benzothiopyran and dihydronapthalene derivatives disclosed herein preferably selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1.</p><p>U.S. Pat.

In step 1, a representative ortho-hydroxybenzaldehyde (salicylaldehyde) derivative 1 is condensed with an acrylate derivative 2 in the presence of base, such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as dimethylformamide, to afford the desired 2H-1-benzopyran ester 3. An alternative base-solvent combination for this condensation includes an organic base such as triethylamine and a solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide. In step 2 the ester is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid, such as by treatment with aqueous base (sodium hydroxide) in a suitable solvent such as ethanol to afford after acidification the substituted 2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylic acid 4. ##STR9##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 2 shows the general method for functionalizing selected 2H-1-benzopyrans. Treatment of the 2H-1-benzopyran carboxylic acid 4 or ester 3 with an electrophillic agent makes a 6-substituted 2H-1-benzopyran 5. A wide variety of electrophillic agents react selectively with 2H-1-benzopyrans 4 in the 6-position to provide new analogs in high yield. Electrophillic reagents such as halogen (chlorine or bromine) give the 6-halo derivatives. Chlorosulfonic acid reacts to afford the 6-position sulfonyl chloride that can further be converted to a sulfonamide or sulfone. Friedel-Crafts acylation of 4 provides 6-acylated 2H-1-benzopyrans in good to excellent yield. A number of other electrophiles can be used to selectively react with these 2H-1-benzopyrans in a similar manner. A 6-position substituted 2H-1-benzopyran can react with an electrophilic reagent at the 8-position using similar chemistries to that described for electrophilic substitution of the 6-position. This yields an 2H-1-benzopyran which is substituted at both the 6 and 8 positions. ##STR10##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 3 illustrates a second general synthesis of substituted 2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylic acids which allows substitution at position 4 of the 2H-1-benzopyran. In this case a commercially or synthetically available subtituted ortho-hydroxy acetophenone 6 is treated with two or more equivalents of a strong base such as lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by reaction with diethyl carbonate to afford the beta-keto ester 7. Ester 7 is condensed with an acid chloride or anhydride in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as toluene with heat to afford 4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran 8. Reduction of the olefin can be accomplished by a variety of agents including sodium borohydride (NaBH.sub.4) in solvent mixtures such as ethanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF), or by use of triethylsilane in a solvent such as trifluoroacetic acid, or by catalytic reduction using palladium on charcoal and hydrogen gas in a solvent such as ethanol to yield the new beta-keto ester 9 (two tautomeric structures shown). Acylation of the oxygen of the ketone enolate in the presence of a base such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine, an acylating agent such as trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, and using a solvent such as methylene chloride yields the enol-triflate 10. Triflate 10 can be reduced with reagents such as tri-n-butyltin hydride, lithium chloride and a palladium (0) catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran to yield 2H-1-benzopyran ester 11 where R" is hydrogen. The ester 11 can be saponified with a base such as 2.5 N sodium hydroxide in a mixed solvent such as tetrahydrofuran-ethanol-water (7:2:1) to yield the desired substituted 2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylic acid.</p><p>To incorporate a carbon fragment R.sup.3 one can treat triflate 10 with reagents known to undergo "cross-coupling" chemistries such a tributylethyenyltin, lithium chloride and a palladium(0) catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran to yield 2H-1-benzopyran ester 11 where R.sup.3 is a vinyl moiety. The ester 6 can be saponified with a base such as 2.5 N sodium hydroxide in a mixed solvent such as tetrahydrofuran-ethanol-water (7:2:1) to yield the desired 4-vinyl-2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylic acid (12, R"=CH.sub.2 CH--). Similarly triflate 10 can be converted under similar conditions using tri-n-butylphenyltin to 2H-1-benzopyran where R.sup.3 =phenyl and by hydrolysis of the ester converted to the carboxylic acid 12 where R.sup.3 =phenyl. Using a similar strategy, substituents which be incorporated as substitutent R.sup.3 can be substituted olefins, substituted aromatics, substuted heteroaryl, acetylenes and substituted acetylenes. ##STR11##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 4 shows an alternative general procedure for the preparation of 4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran 8. Treatment of an ortho-fluorobenzoyl chloride with an appropriately substituted beta-keto ester 14 with a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as toluene provides 4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran 8. 4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran 8 can be converted to 2H-1-benzopyran 12 as described in Scheme 3. ##STR12##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 5 shows a general method for substitution of the aromatic ring of the 2H-1-benzopyran. This can be accomplished through organo-palladium mediated "cross-coupling" chemistries using a palladium (0) catalyst to couple benzopyran 15 at position Y, where Y is iodide, bromide or triflate, with an acetylene, olefin, nitrile, or aryl coupling agent. Substituted acetylenes as the coupling agent will provide the corresponding substituted acetylene. Substituted aryl moieties can be incorporated using arylboronic acids or esters; nitriles can be incorporated by use of zinc (II) cyanide. The resulting ester 16 can be converted to carboxylic acid 17 as described in Scheme 1.</p><p>Another approach to substitution of the aryl moiety of the benzopyran 15 is to convert Y, where Y is iodide or bromide, to a perfluoroalkyl moiety. Exemplary of this transformation is the conversion of 15 (Y=iodide) to 16 (R.sup.2 '=pentafluoroethyl) using a potassium pentafluoropropionate and copper (I) iodide in hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). The resulting ester 16 can be converted to carboxylic acid 15 as described in Scheme 1.</p><p>A similar method adds substitution of the aromatic ring in dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylates. This can be accomplished through organopalladium couplings with aryl iodides, bromides, or triflates and various coupling agents (R. F. Heck, Palladium Reagents in Organic Synthesis. Academic Press 1985). When using a suitable palladium catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenyl-phospine)palladium(0) in this reaction, coupling agents such as alkynes provide disubstituted alkynes, phenyl boronic acids afford biphenyl compounds, and cyanides produce arylcyano compounds. A number of other palladium catalysts and coupling reagents could be used to selectively react with appropriately substituted dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylates in a similar manner. ##STR13##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 6 shows a general synthetic route for conversion of a commercially or synthetically available substituted phenol into a substituted salicylaldehyde. Several different methods which utilize formaldehyde or a chemically equivalent reagent are described in detail below.</p><p>Reaction of an appropriately substituted phenol 18 in basic media with formaldehyde (or chemical equivalent) will yield the corresponding salicylaldehyde 1. The intermediate, ortho-hydroxymethylphenol 19, will under appropriate reaction conditions be oxidized to the salicylaldehyde 1 in situ. The reaction commonly employs ethyl magnesium bromide or magnesium methoxide(one equivalent) as the base, toluene as the solvent, paraformaldehyde (two or more equivalents) as the source of formaldehyde, and employs hexamethylphoramide (HMPA) or N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). (See: Casiraghi, G. et al., J.C.S.Perkin I, 1978, 318-321.)</p><p>Alternatively an appropriately substituted phenol 18 may react with formaldehyde under aqueous basic conditions to form the substituted ortho-hydroxybenzyl alcohol 19 (See: a) J. Leroy and C. Wakselman, J. Fluorine Chem., 40, 23-32 (1988). b) A. A. Moshfegh, et al., Helv. Chim. Acta., 65, 1229-1232 (1982)). Commonly used bases include aqueous vpotassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. Formalin (38% formaldehyde in water) is commonly employed as the source of formaldehyde. The resulting ortho-hydroxybenzyl alcohol 19 can be converted to the salicylaldehyde 1 by an oxidizing agent such as manganese (IV) dioxide in a solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform (See: R-G. Xie, et al., Synthetic Commun. 24, 53-58 (1994)).</p><p>An appropriately substituted phenol 18 can be treated under acidic conditions with hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) to prepare the salicylaldehyde 1 (Duff Reaction; See: Y. Suzuki, and H. Takahashi, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 31, 1751-1753 (1983)). This reaction commonly employs acids such as acetic acid, boric acid, methanesulfonic acid, or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The source of formaldehyde commonly used is hexamethylenetetramine. ##STR14##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 7 shows the Reimer-Tiemann reaction in which an commercially or synthetically available appropriately substituted phenol 18 will under basic conditions react with chloroform to yield a substituted salicylaldehyde 1 (See: Cragoe, E. J.; Schultz, E. M., U.S. Pat. No. 3,794,734, 1974). ##STR15##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 8 shows the conversion of a commercially or synthetically available appropriately substituted salicylic acid 21 to its respective salicylaldehyde 1 via an intermediate 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol 19. Reduction of the salicylic acid 21 can be accomplished with a hydride reducing agent such as borane in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Treatment of the intermediate 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol 19 with an oxidizing agent such as manganese (IV) oxide in a solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform provides salicylaldehyde 1. ##STR16##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 9 illustrates a general synthetic method for preparation of a wide variety of substituted 2-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-1-benzothiopyran-3-carboxylic acids (25). In step 1, an appropriately commercially or synthetically available substituted thiophenol 22 is ortho-metallated with a base such as n-butyllithium employing TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) followed by treatment with dimethylformamide to provide the 2-mercaptobenzaldehyde 23. Condensation of the 2-mercaptobenzaldehyde 23 with an acrylate 2 in the presence of base provides ester 24 which can be saponified in the presence of aqueous base to afford the substituted 2H-1-benzothiopyran-3-carboxylic acids 25. ##STR17##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 10 shows a method for preparing a substituted 2-mercaptobenzaldehyde from an appropriate commercially or synthetically available substituted salicylaldehyde. In step 1, the phenolic hydroxyl of salicylaldehyde 1 is converted to the corresponding O-aryl thiocarbamate 26 by acylation with an appropriately substituted thiocarbamoyl chloride such as N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide using a base such as triethylamine. In Step 2, O-aryl thiocarbamate 26 rearranges to S-aryl thiocarbamate 27 when heated sufficiently such as to 200 solvent such as N,N-dimethylaniline (See: A. Levai, and P. Sebok, Synth. Commun., 22 1735-1750 (1992)). Hydrolysis of S-aryl thiocarbamate 27 with a base such as 2.5 N sodium hydroxide in a solvent mixture such as tetrahydrofuran and ethanol yields the substituted 2-mercaptobenzaldehyde 23 which can be converted to the substituted 2H-1-benzothiopyran-3-carboxylic acids 25 as described in Scheme 9. ##STR18##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 11 illustrates the general method for the preparation of a wide variety of dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives 30. R.sup.2 represents the aromatic substitution of commercially and synthetically available 2-aminobenzaldeydes 28. The 2-amino-benzaldehyde derivative 28, where R.sup.2 represents various substitutions, is condensed with a acrylate derivative 2 in the presence of base such as potassium carbonate, triethylamine, or diazbicyclo[2.2.2]undec-7-ene in solvents such as dimethylformamide to afford the dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate esters 29. The ester 29 can be saponified to the corresponding acid, such as by treatment with aqueous inorganic base such as 2.5 N sodium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol to afford after acidification the desired dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid 30. ##STR19##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 12 illustrates the preparation of dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid 30 from 2-aminobenzoic acids 31. R.sup.2 represents the aromatic substitution of commercially and synthetically available 2-aminobenzoic acids 31. Reduction of the representative 2-aminobenzoic acid 31 to the desired 2-aminobenzyl alcohol 32 was accomplished with a hydride reducing agent such as borane in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Treatment of the desired 2-aminobenzyl alcohol 32 with an oxidizing agent such as manganese(IV)oxide in a solvent such as methylene chloride provides the representative 2-aminobenzaldehydes 28. (C. T. Alabaster, et al. J. Med. Chem. 31, 2048-2056 (1988)) The 2-aminobenzaldehydes were converted to the desired dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid 30 as described in Scheme 11. ##STR20##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 13 illustrates the general method for the preparation of a wide variety of dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives 30 from isatins 33. R.sup.2 represents the aromatic substitution of commercially and synthetically available isatins 33. A representative isatin 33 was treated with basic peroxide generated from hydrogen peroxide and a base such as sodium hydroxide to afford the desired representative 2-aminobenzoic acids 31. (M. S. Newman and M. W. Lougue, J. Org. Chem., 36, 1398-1401 (1971)) The 2-aminobenzoic acids 31 are subsequently converted to the desired dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives 30 as described in synthetic Scheme 12. ##STR21##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 14 is another general method for the preparation of dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives 30. In step 1, an appropriate commercially or synthetically available substituted aniline 34 can be treated with an acylating reagent such as pivaloyl chloride yielding an amide 35. The ortho-dianion of amide 35 is prepared by treating amide 35 with organo-lithium bases such as n-butyllithium or tert-butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran at low temperature. The dianion is quenched with dimethylformamide to afford the acylated-2-amino-benzaldehydes 36. (J. Turner, J. Org. Chem., 48, 3401-3408 (1983)) Reaction of these aldehydes in the presence of bases such as lithium hydride with a acrylate followed by work up with aqueous inorganic bases and hydrolysis, such as by treatment with aqueous base (sodium hydroxide) in a suitable solvent such as ethanol affords, after acidification, a dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid 30. ##STR22##</p><p>Synthetic Scheme 15 shows a general method for alkylation of the nitrogen of dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate ester derivatives 29. The step involves treatment of dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate ester derivatives 29 with alkyl halides such as iodoethane in the presence of phase transfer catalysts such a tetrabutylammonium iodide, and a base such as caustic (50% aqueous sodium hydroxide) in a solvent such as dichloromethane. These conditions afford the N-alkylated dihyrdoquinoline-3-carboxylate esters 37. Saponification of 37 with aqueous base provides N-alkylated-dihyroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives 38.</p><p>The following examples contain detailed descriptions of the methods of preparation of compounds of Formulas I-II.

Rats were fasted with free access to water for over sixteen hours prior to the test. The rats were dosed orally (1 mL) with compounds suspended in vehicle containing 0.5% methylcellulose and 0.025% surfactant, or with vehicle alone. One hour later a subplantar injection of 0.1 mL of 1% solution of carrageenan/sterile 0.9% saline was administered and the volume of the injected foot was measured with a displacement plethysmometer connected to a pressure transducer with a digital indicator. Three hours after the injection of the carrageenan, the volume of the foot was again measured. The average foot swelling in a group of drug-treated animals was compared with that of a group of placebo-treated animals and the percentage inhibition of edema was determined (Otterness and Bliven, Laboratory Models for Testing NSAIDs, in Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, (J.

The % inhibition shows the % decrease from control paw volume determined in this procedure and the data for selected compounds in this invention are summarized in Table I.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE I______________________________________     RAT PAW EDEMA  ANALGESIA   % Inhibition % Inhibition  Example @ 30 mg/kg body weight @ 30 mg/kg body weight______________________________________1         57             58______________________________________</pre></p><p>Evaluation of COX-1 and COX-2 activity in vitro</p><p>The compounds of this invention exhibited inhibition in vitro of COX-2. The COX-2 inhibition activity of the compounds of this invention illustrated in the Examples was determined by the following methods.</p><p>a. Preparation of recombinant COX baculoviruses</p><p>Recombinant COX-1 and COX-2 were prepared as described by Gierse et al, [J. Biochem., 305, 479-84 (1995)]. A 2.0 kb fragment containing the coding region of either human or murine COX-1 or human or murine COX-2 was cloned into a BamHl site of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen) to generate the baculovirus transfer vectors for COX-1 and COX-2 in a manner similar to the method of D. R. O'Reilly et al (Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual (1992)). Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated by transfecting 4 pg of baculovirus transfer vector DNA into SF9 insect cells (2 baculovirus plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method. See M. D. Summers and G. E. Smith, A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures, Texas Agric. Exp. Station Bull. 1555 (1987). Recombinant viruses were purified by three rounds of plaque purification and high titer (10.sup.7 -10.sup.8 pfu/mL) stocks of virus were prepared. For large scale production, SF9 insect cells were infected in 10 liter fermentors (0.5.times.10.sup.6 /mL) with the recombinant baculovirus stock such that the multiplicity of infection was 0.1. After 72 hours the cells were centrifuged and the cell pellet homogenized in Tris/Sucrose (50 mM: 25%, pH 8.0) containing 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 resultant supernatant was stored at -80 for COX activity.</p><p>b. Assay for COX-1 and COX-2 activity</p><p>COX activity was assayed as PGE.sub.2 formed/jg protein/time using an ELISA to detect the prostaglandin released. CHAPS-solubilized insect cell membranes containing the appropriate COX enzyme were incubated in a potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) containing epinephrine, phenol, and heme with the addition of arachidonic acid (10 μM). Compounds were pre-incubated with the enzyme for 10-20 minutes prior to the addition of arachidonic acid. Any reaction between the arachidonic acid and the enzyme was stopped after ten minutes at 37 transferring 40 μl of reaction mix into 160 μl ELISA buffer and 25 μM indomethacin. The PGE.sub.2 formed was measured by standard ELISA technology (Cayman Chemical). Results are shown in Table II.</p><p>c. Fast assay for COX-1 and COX-2 activity</p><p>COX activity was assayed as PGE.sub.2 formed/μg protein/time using an ELISA to detect the prostaglandin released. CHAPS-solubilized insect cell membranes containing the appropriate COX enzyme were incubated in a potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 M Potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 μM phenol, 1 μM heme, 300 μM epinephrine) with the addition of 20 μl of 100 μM arachidonic acid (10 μM). Compounds were pre-incubated with the enzyme for 10 minutes at 25 arachidonic acid. Any reaction between the arachidonic acid and the enzyme was stopped after two minutes at 37 transferring 40 μl of reaction mix into 160 μl ELISA buffer and 25 μM indomethacin.

The active compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. The active compounds and composition may, for example, be administered orally, intravascularly, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or topically.</p><p>The phrase "co-therapy" (or "combination-therapy"), in defining use of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor agent and another pharmaceutical agent, is intended to embrace administration of each agent in a sequential manner in a regimen that will provide beneficial effects of the drug combination, and is intended as well to embrace co-administration of these agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule having a fixed ratio of these active agents or in multiple, separate capsules for each agent.</p><p>The phrase "therapeutically-effective" is intended to qualify the amount of each agent which will achieve the goal of improvement in disease severity and the frequency of incidence over treatment of each agent by itself, while avoiding adverse side effects typically associated with alternative therapies.</p><p>For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or capsules. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water may be used as a suitable carrier.</p><p>The amount of therapeutically active compounds which are administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed, and thus may vary widely. The pharmaceutical compositions may contain active ingredients in the range of about 0.1 to 2000 mg, preferably in the range of about 0.5 to 500 mg and most preferably between about 1 and 100 mg. A daily dose of about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 0.5 and about 20 mg/kg body weight and most preferably between about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day.</p><p>In the case of psoriasis and other skin conditions, it may be preferable to apply a topical preparation of compounds of this invention to the affected area two to four times a day.</p><p>For inflammations of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream, or as a suppository, containing the active ingredients in a total amount of, for example, 0.075 to 30% w/w, preferably 0.2 to 20% w/w and most preferably 0.4 to 15% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulation may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogs. The compounds of this invention can also be administered by a transdermal device. Preferably topical administration will be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid matrix variety. In either case, the active agent is delivered continuously from the reservoir or microcapsules through a membrane into the active agent permeable adhesive, which is in contact with the skin or mucosa of the recipient. If the active agent is absorbed through the skin, a controlled and predetermined flow of the active agent is administered to the recipient. In the case of microcapsules, the encapsulating agent may also function as the membrane.</p><p>The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, and sodium lauryl sulfate, among others.</p><p>The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus, the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters may be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.</p><p>Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredients are dissolved or suspended in suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredients. The antiinflammatory active ingredients are preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% and particularly about 1.5% w/w.</p><p>For therapeutic purposes, the active compounds of this combination invention are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the indicated route of administration. If administered per os, the compounds may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Formulations for parenteral administration may be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules having one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration. The compounds may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical art.</p><p>All mentioned references are incorporated by reference as if here written.
