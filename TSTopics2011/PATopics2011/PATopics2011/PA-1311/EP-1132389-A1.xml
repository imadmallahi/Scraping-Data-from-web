for the treatment of obesity.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention relates to new aza-indolyl derivatives, to processes and
intermediates for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions cuntaining them and
to their medicinal use. The active compounds of the present invention are useful in
treating obesity and other disorders.</p><p num="0002">It has been recognised that obesity is a disease process influenced by
environmental factors in which the traditional weight loss methods of dieting and exercise
need to be supplemented by therapeutic products (S. Parker, "<i>Obesity: Trends and
Treatments",</i> Scrip Reports, PJB Publications Ltd, 1996).</p><p num="0003">Whether someone is classified as overweight or obese is generally determined
on the basis of their body mass index (BMI) which is calculated by dividing body weight
(kg) by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Thus, the units of BMI are kg/m<sup>2</sup> and it is possible to
calculate the BMI range associated with minimum mortality in each decade of life.
Overweight is defined as a BMI in the range 25-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and obesity as a BMI greater
than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. There are problems with this definition in that it does not take into
account the proportion of body mass that is muscle in relation to fat (adipose tissue). To
account for this, obesity can also be defined on the basis of body fat content: greater than
25% and 30% in males and females, respectively.</p><p num="0004">As the BMI increases there is an increased risk of death from a variety of causes
that is independent of other risk factors. The most common diseases with obesity are 
cardiovascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes (obesity aggravates the
development of diabetes), gall bladder disease (particularly cancer) and diseases of
reproduction. Research has shown that even a modest reduction in body weight can
correspond to a significant reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease.</p><p num="0005">Compounds marketed as anti-obesity agents include Orlistat (XENICAL®) and
Sibutramine. Orlistat (a lipase inhibitor) inhibits fat absorption directly and tends to
produce a high incidence of unpleasant (though relatively harmless) side-effects such as
diarrhoea. Sibutramine (a mixed 5-HT/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) can increase
blood pressure and heart rate in some patients. The serotonin releaser/reuptake inhibitors
fenfluramine (Pondimin®) and dexfenfluramine (Redux™) have been reported to decrease
food intake and body weight over a prolonged period (greater than 6 months). However,
both products were withdrawn after reports of preliminary evidence of heart valve
abnormalities associated with their use. There is therefore a need for the development of a
safer anti-obesity agent.</p><p num="0006">The non-selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists/partial agonists m-chlorophenylpiperazine
(mCPP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) have
been shown to reduce food intake in rats (G.A. Kennett and G. Curzon, <i>Psychopharmacol</i>.,
1988, 96, 93-100; G.A. Kennett, C.T. Dourish and G. Curzon, <i>Eur</i>. <i>J</i>. <i>Pharmacol</i>., 1987, <b>141</b>,
429-435) and to accelerate the appearance of the behavioural satiety sequence (S.J.
Kitchener and C.T. Dourish, <i>Psychopharmacol</i>., 1994, 113, 369-377). Recent findings from
studies with mCPP in normal human volunteers and obese subjects have also shown
decreases in food intake. Thus, a single dose of mCPP decreased food intake in female
volunteers (A.E.S. Walsh <i>et al</i>., <i>Psychopharmacol</i>., 1994, <b>116</b>, 120-122) and decreased the
appetite and body weight of obese male and female subjects during subchronic treatment
for a 14 day period (P.A. Sargeant <i>et al</i>., <i>Psychopharmacol</i>., 1997, 133, 309-312). The
anorectic action of mCPP is absent in 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor knockout mutant mice (L.H.
Tecott <i>et al</i>., <i>Nature,</i> 1995, <b>374</b>, 542-546) and is antagonised by the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor
antagonist SB-242084 in rats (G.A. Kennett <i>et al</i>., <i>Neuropharmacol</i>., 1997, <b>36</b>, 609-620). It
seems therefore that mCPP decreases food intake via an agonist action at the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>
receptor.</p><p num="0007">Other compounds which have been proposed as 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists for use in
the treatment of obesity include the substituted 1-aminoethyl indoles disclosed in EP-A-0655440.
CA-2132887 and CA-2153937 disclose that tricyclic 1-aminoethylpyrrole 
derivatives and tricyclic 1-aminoethyl pyrazole derivatives bind to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and
may be used in the treatment of obesity. WO-A-98/30548 discloses aminoalkylindazole
compounds as 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonists for the treatment of CNS diseases and appetite regulation
disorders. 2-(2,3-Dihydro-1<i>H</i>-pyrrolo[1,2-a]indol-9-yl)ethylamine is disclosed in
<i>J</i>.<i>Med</i>.<i>Chem</i>., 1965, <b>8</b>, 700. The preparation of pyrido[1,2-<i>a</i>]indoles for the treatment of
cerebrovascular disorders is disclosed in EP-A-0252643 and EP-A-0167901. The
preparation of 10-[(acylamino)ethyl]tetrahydropyrido[1,2-<i>a</i>]indoles as anti-ischemic
agents is disclosed in EP-A-0279125.</p><p num="0008">It is an object of this invention to provide selective, directly acting 5HT<sub>2</sub>
receptor ligands for use in therapy and particularly for use as anti-obesity agents. It is a
further object of this invention to provide directly acting ligands selective for 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>
and/or 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, for use in therapy and particularly for use as anti-obesity agents.
