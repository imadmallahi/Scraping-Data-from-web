where R<sub>3</sub> is an alkoxy of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, with 2 carbon atoms being particularly preferred; and alk is a divalent hydrocarbon of 2 to 18 carbon atoms with 3 to 16 carbon atoms being particularly preferred. In one embodiment, the non-sulfur containing organosilicon compound is propyl triethoxysilane. In another embodiment, the non-sulfur containing organosilicon compound is octyl triethoxysilane.</p><p num="p0041">The amount of the non-sulfur containing organosilicon compound of formula IV in a rubber composition will vary depending on the level of other additives that are used. Generally speaking, the amount of the compound of formula IV will range from 0.5 to 20 phr. Preferably, the amount will range from 1 to 10 phr.</p><p num="p0042">It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber composition would be compounded by methods generally known in the rubber compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example, sulfur donors, curing aids, such as activators and retarders and processing additives, such as oils, resins including tackifying resins and plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants and peptizing agents. As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional amounts. Representative examples of sulfur donors include elemental sulfur (free sulfur), an amine disulfide, polymeric polysulfide and sulfur olefin adducts. Preferably, the sulfur vulcanizing agent is elemental sulfur. The sulfur vulcanizing agent may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 8 phr. Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise 0.5 to 10 phr. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise 1 to 50 phr. Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, naphthenic, and/or paraffinic processing oils, and low PCA oils having a polycyclic aromatic (PCA) content of less than 3% by weight (IP346 method), including MES, TDAE, heavy naphthenic, and SRAE oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise 1 to 5 phr. Representative antioxidants may<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in the <nplcit id="ncit0003" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), Pages 344 through 346</text></nplcit>. Typical amounts of antiozonants comprise 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include stearic acid comprise 0.5 to 3 phr. Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise 2 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of peptizers comprise 0.1 to 1 phr. Typical peptizers may be, for example, pentachlorothiophenol and dibenzamidodiphenyl disulfide.</p><p num="p0043">Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. A primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from 0.5 to 4. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound.</p><p num="p0044">The mixing of the rubber composition can be accomplished by methods known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. For example the ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely at least one non-productive stage followed by a productive mix stage. The final curatives including sulfur vulcanizing agents are typically mixed in the final stage which is conventionally called the "productive" mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive mix stage(s). The rubber composition is mixed in one or more non-productive mix stages. The rubber composition containing the copolymer rubber, as well as the non-sulfur-containing organosilicon compound may be subjected to a thermomechanical mixing step. The thermomechanical mixing step generally comprises a mechanical working in a mixer or extruder for a period of time suitable in order to produce a rubber temperature between 140°C and 190°C. The appropriate duration of the thermomechanical working varies as a function of the operating conditions and the volume and nature of the components. For example, the thermomechanical working may be from 1 to 20 minutes.</p> <p num="p0045">The rubber composition may be incorporated in a variety of rubber<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> components of the tire. For example, the rubber component may be a tread (including tread cap and tread base), sidewall, apex, chafer, sidewall insert, wirecoat or innerliner. Preferably, the compound is a tread.</p><p num="p0046">The pneumatic tire of the present invention may be a race tire, passenger tire, aircraft tire, agricultural, earthmover, off-the-road, truck tire and the like. Preferably, the tire is a passenger or truck tire. The tire may also be a radial or bias, with a radial being preferred.</p><p num="p0047">Vulcanization of the pneumatic tire of the present invention is generally carried out at conventional temperatures ranging from 100°C to 200°C. Preferably, the vulcanization is conducted at temperatures ranging from 110°C to 180°C. Any of the usual vulcanization processes may be used such as heating in a press or mold, heating with superheated steam or hot air. Such tires can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various methods which are known and will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art.</p><heading><b><u style="single">EXAMPLE</u></b> </heading> <p num="p0048">Four rubber compounds were prepared to demonstrate the significance of the combination of a copolymer rubber having pendant hydroxyl groups in combination with non-sulfur containing silane. Samples A and B are considered Controls due to the absence of the copolymer rubber having pendant hydroxyl groups or the non-sulfur containing silane. Samples C and D are considered representative of the present invention.</p> <p num="p0049">The rubber compositions were prepared in an internal rubber mixer using three separate stages of addition (mixing), namely, two sequential non-productive mix stages (without the sulfur and accelerator curatives) to a temperature of 160°C and one final productive mix stage (with sulfur and accelerator curatives) to a temperature of 115°C.</p><p num="p0050">Materials used for this Example are illustrated in the following Table 1.
