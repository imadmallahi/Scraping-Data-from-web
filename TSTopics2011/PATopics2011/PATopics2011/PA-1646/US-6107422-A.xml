It is well known in the art that the structure of these various polymers, and hence their properties and uses, are highly dependent on the catalyst and specific conditions used during their synthesis. In addition to these factors, processes in which these types of polymers can be made at reduced cost are also important. Therefore, improved processes for making such (new) polymers are of interest. Also disclosed herein are uses for the novel polymers.</p><p>α-Olefins are commercial materials being particularly useful as monomers and as chemical intermediates. For a review of α-olefins, including their uses and preparation, see B. Elvers, et al., Ed., Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., Vol. A13, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, 1989, p. 238-251. They are useful as chemical intermediates and they are often made by the oligomerization of ethylene using various types of catalysts. Therefore catalysts which are capable or forming α-olefins from ethylene are constantly sought.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>This invention concerns a polyolefin, which contains about 80 to about 150 branches per 1000 methylene groups and which contains for every 100 branches that are methyl, about 30 to about 90 ethyl branches, about 4 to about 20 propyl branches, about 15 to about 50 butyl branches, about 3 to about 15 amyl branches, and about 30 to about 140 hexyl or longer branches.</p><p>This invention also concerns a polyolefin which contains about 20 to about 150 branches per 1000 methylene groups, and which contains for every 100 branches that are methyl, about 4 to about 20 ethyl branches, about 1 to about 12 propyl branches, about 1 to about 12 butyl branches, about 1 to about 10 amyl branches, and 0 to about 20 hexyl or longer branches.</p><p>Disclosed herein is a polymer, consisting essentially of repeat units derived from the monomers, ethylene and a compound of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1, wherein R.sup.1 is hydrogen, hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, and m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 16, and which contains about 0.01 to about 40 mole percent of repeat units derived from said compound, and provided that said repeat units derived from said compound are in branches of the formula --CH(CH.sub.2).sub.n CO.sub.2 R.sup.1, in about 30 to about 70 mole percent of said branches n is 5 or more, in about 0 to about 20 mole percent n is 4, in about 3 to 60 mole percent n is 1, 2, and 3, and in about 1 to about 60 mole percent n is 0.</p><p>This invention concerns a polymer of one or more alpha-olefins of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a H wherein a is an integer of 2 or more, which contains the structure (XXV) ##STR1## wherein R.sup.35 is an alkyl group and R.sup.36 is an alkyl group containing two or more carbon atoms, and provided that R.sup.35 is methyl in about 2 mole percent or more of the total amount of (XXV) in said polymer.</p><p>This invention also includes a polymer of one or more alpha-olefins of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a H wherein a is an integer of 2 or more, wherein said polymer contains methyl branches and said methyl branches comprise about 25 to about 75 mole percent of the total branches.</p><p>This invention also concerns a polyethylene containing the structure (XXVII) in an amount greater than can be accounted for by end groups, and preferably at least 0.5 or more of such branches per 1000 methylene groups that can be accounted for by end groups. ##STR2##</p><p>This invention also concerns a polypropylene containing one or both of the structures (XXVIII) and (XXIX) and in the case of (XXIX) in amounts greater than can be accounted for by end groups.

It is also preferred that all of R.sup.28, R.sup.29, and R.sup.30 are hydrogen, and/or that both R.sup.44 and R.sup.45 are 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl or 9-anthracenyl.</p><p>In (XV) it is preferred that both of R.sup.31 are hydrogen.</p><p>In (XIII), (XXIII) and (XXXII) (as polymerization catalysts and as novel compounds) it is preferred that all of R.sup.20, R.sup.21, R.sup.22 and R.sup.23 are methyl. It is also preferred that T.sup.1 and T.sup.2 are methyl. For (XIII), when M is Ni(I) or (II), it is preferred that both Q and S are bromine, while when M is Pd it is preferred that Q is methyl and S is chlorine.</p><p>Compounds (II), (IV) or (VII) will each also cause the polymerization of one or more of an olefin, and/or a selected cyclic olefin such as cyclobutene, cyclopentene or norbornene, and, when it is a Pd(II) complex, optionally copolymerize an ester or carboxylic acid of the formula CH.sub.2 =CH(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1, wherein m is 0 or an integer of 1 to 16 and R.sup.1 is hydrogen or hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, by themselves (without cocatalysts). However, (III) often cannot be used when the ester is present. When norbornene or substituted norbornene is present no other monomer should be present.</p><p>Other monomers which may be used with compounds (II), (IV) or (VII) (when it is a Pd(II) complex) to form copolymers with olefins and selected cycloolefins are carbon monoxide (CO), and vinyl ketones of the general formula H.sub.2 C═CHC(O)R.sup.25, wherein R.sup.25 is alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and it is preferred that R.sup.25 is methyl. In the case of the vinyl ketones, the same compositional limits on the polymers produced apply as for the carboxylic acids and esters described as comonomers in the immediately preceding paragraph.</p><p>CO forms alternating copolymers with the various olefins and cycloolefins which may be polymerized with compounds (II), (IV) or (VII). The polymerization to form the alternating copolymers is done with both CO and the olefin simultaneously in the process mixture, and available to the catalyst. It is also possible to form block copolymers containing the alternating CO/(cyclo)olefin copolymers and other blocks containing just that olefin or other olefins or mixtures thereof. This may be done simply by sequentially exposing compounds (II), (IV) or (VII), and their subsequent living polymers, to the appropriate monomer or mixture of monomers to form the desired blocks. Copolymers of CO, a (cyclo)olefin and a saturated carboxylic acid or ester of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1, wherein m is 0 or an integer of 1 to 16 and R.sup.1 is hydrogen or hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, may also be made by simultaneously exposing the polymerization catalyst or living polymer to these 3 types of monomers.</p><p>The polymerizations may be carried out with (II), (III), (IV) or (VII), and other catalyst molecules or combinations, initially in the solid state [assuming (II), (III) (IV) or (VII) is a solid] or in solution. The olefin and/or cycloolefin may be in the gas or liquid state (including gas dissolved in a solvent). A liquid, which may or may not be a solvent for any or all of the reactants and/or products may also be present. Suitable liquids include alkanes, cycloalkanes, halogenated alkanes and cycloalkanes, ethers, water, and alcohols, except that when (III) is used, hydrocarbons should preferably be used as solvents. Specific useful solvents include methylene chloride, hexane, CO.sub.2, chloroform, perfluoro(n-butyltetrahydrofuran) (herein sometimes called FC-75), toluene, dichlorobenzene, 2-ethylhexanol, and benzene.</p><p>It is particularly noteworthy that one of the liquids which can be used in this polymerization process with (II), (III), (IV) or (VII) is water, see for instance Examples 213-216. Not only can water be present but the polymerization "medium" may be largely water, and various types of surfactants may be employed so that an emulsion polymerization may be done, along with a suspension polymerization when surfactants are not employed.</p><p>Preferred olefins and cycloolefins in the polymerization using (II), (III) or (IV) are one or more of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-butene, cyclopentene, 1-tetradecene, and norbornene; and ethylene, propylene and cyclopentene are more preferred. Ethylene alone is especially preferred.</p><p>Olefinic esters or carboxylic acids of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1 is hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, or substituted hydrocarbyl, and m is 0 or an integer of 1 to 16. It is preferred if R.sup.1 hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl and it is more preferred if it is alkyl containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or glycidyl. It is also preferred if m is 0 and/or R.sup.1 is alkyl containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms. It is preferred to make copolymers containing up to about 60 mole percent, preferably up to about 20 mole percent of repeat units derived from the olefinic ester or carboxylic acid. Total repeat unit units in the polymer herein refer not only to those in the main chain from each monomer unit, but those in branches or side chains as well.</p><p>When using (II), (III), (IV) or (VII) as a catalyst it is preferred that R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are hydrogen, methyl, or taken together are ##STR59## It is also preferred that both R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, 2,6-dimethylphenyl, 4-methylphenyl, phenyl, 2,6-diethylphenyl, 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl and 2-t-butylphenyl. When (II) is used, it is preferred that T.sup.1 is methyl, R.sup.6 is methyl or ethyl and R.sup.7 is methyl. When (III) is used it is preferred that T.sup.1 is methyl and said Lewis base is R.sup.6.sub.2 O, wherein R.sup.6 is methyl or ethyl. When (IV) is used it is preferred that R.sup.8 is methyl, n is 3 and R.sup.16 is hydrogen.

The pressure can affect the microstructure of the polyolefin produced (see below).</p><p>Catalysts of the formulas (II), (III), (IV) and (VII) may also be supported on a solid catalyst (as opposed to just being added as a solid or in solution), for instance on silica gel (see Example 98). By supported is meant that the catalyst may simply be carried physically on the surface of the solid support, may be adsorbed, or carried by the support by other means.</p><p>When using (XXX) as a ligand or in any process or reaction herein it is preferred that n is 2, all of R.sup.30, R.sup.28 and R.sup.29 are hydrogen, and both of R.sup.44 and R.sup.45 are 9-anthracenyl.</p><p>Another polymerization process comprises contacting a compound of the formula [Pd(R.sup.13 CN).sub.4 ]X.sub.2 or a combination of Pd[OC(O)R.sup.40 ].sub.2 and HX, with a compound of the formula ##STR60## and one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of ethylene, an olefin of the formula R.sup.17 CH═CH.sub.2 or R.sup.17 CH═CHR.sup.17, cyclopentene, cyclobutene, substituted norbornene and norbornene, wherein: R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are each independently hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, provided that the carbon atom bound to the imino nitrogen atom has at least two carbon atoms bound to it; R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are each independently hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 taken together are hydrocarbylene or substituted hydrocarbylene to form a carbocyclic ring; each R.sup.17 is independently hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl provided that R.sup.17 contains no olefinic bonds; R.sup.40 is hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl; and X is a weakly coordinating anion; provided that when norbornene or substituted norbornene is present no other monomer is present.</p><p>It is believed that in this process a catalyst similar to (II) may be initially generated, and this then causes the polymerization. Therefore, all of the conditions, monomers (including olefinic esters and carboxylic acids), etc., which are applicable to the process using (II) as a polymerization catalyst are applicable to this process. All preferred items are also the same, including appropriate groups such as R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, and combinations thereof. This process however should be run so that all of the ingredients can contact each other, preferably in a single phase. Initially at least, it is preferred that this is done in solution. The molar ratio of (VIII) to palladium compound used is not critical, but for most economical use of the compounds, a moderate excess, about 25 to 100% excess, of (VIII) is preferably used.</p><p>As mentioned above, it is believed that in the polymerization using (VIII) and [Pd(R.sup.13 CN).sub.4 ]X.sub.2 or a Pd[II] carboxylate a catalyst similar to (II) is formed. Other combinations of starting materials that can combine into catalysts similar to (II), (III), (IV) and (VII) often also cause similar polymerizations, see for instance Examples 238 and 239. Also combinations of α-diimines or other diimino ligands described herein with: a nickel [0] or nickel [I] compound, oxygen, an alkyl aluminum compound and an olefin; a nickel [0] compound, an acid such as HX and an olefin; or an α-diimine Ni[0] or nickel [I] complex, oxygen, an alkyl aluminum compound and an olefin. Thus active catalysts from α-diimines and other bidentate imino compounds can be formed beforehand or in the same "pot" (in situ) in which the polymerization takes place. In all of the polymerizations in which the catalysts are formed in situ, preferred groups on the α-diimines are the same as for the preformed catalysts.</p><p>In general Ni[0] or Ni(II) compounds may be used as precursors to active catalyst species. They must have ligands which can be displaced by the appropriate bidentate nitrogen ligand, or must already contain such a bidentate ligand already bound to the nickel atom. Ligands which may be displaced include 1,5-cyclooctadiene and tris(o-tolyl)phosphite, which may be present in Ni[0] compounds, or dibenzylideneacetone, as in the useful Pd[0] precursor tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium[0]. These lower valence nickel compounds are believed to be converted into active Ni[II] catalytic species. As such they must also be contacted (react with) with an oxidizing agent and a source of a weakly coordinating anion (X.sup.-). Oxidizing agents include oxygen, HX (wherein X is a weakly coordinating anion), and other well known oxidizing agents. Sources of X.sup.- include HX, alkylaluminum compounds, alkali metal and silver salts of X.sup.-. As can be seen above, some compounds such as HX may act as both an oxidizing agent and a source of X.sup.-. Compounds containing other lower valent metals may be converted into active catalyst species by similar methods.</p><p>When contacted with an alkyl aluminum compound or HX useful Ni[0] compounds include ##STR61##</p><p>Various types of Ni[0] compounds are known in the literature.

Likewise, the conditions used and preferred for polymerizations with (XIV) are similar to those used and preferred for (II), except that higher olefin pressures (when the olefin is a gas) are preferred. Preferred pressures are about 2.0 to about 20 MPa. (XIV) may be prepared by the reaction of one mole of [Pd(R.sup.13 CN).sub.4 ]X.sub.2 with one mole of (VIII) in acetonitrile or nitromethane.</p><p>Novel compound (XIV) is used as an olefin polymerization catalyst.

By a π-allyl group is meant a monoanionic with 3 adjacent sp.sup.2 carbon atoms bound to a metal center in an η.sup.3 fashion. The three sp.sup.2 carbon atoms may be substituted with other hydrocarbyl groups or functional groups. Typical π-allyl groups include ##STR63## wherein R is hydrocarbyl. By a π-benzyl group is meant π-allyl ligand in which two of the sp.sup.2 carbon atoms are part of an aromatic ring. Typical π-benzyl groups include ##STR64##</p><p>π-Benzyl compounds usually initiate polymerization of the olefins fairly readily even at room temperature, but π-allyl compounds may not necessarily do so. Initiation of π-allyl compounds can be improved by using one or more of the following methods:</p><p>Using a higher temperature such as about 80</p><p>Decreasing the bulk of the α-diimine ligand, such as R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 being 2,6-dimethylphenyl instead of 2,6-diisopropylphenyl.</p><p>Making the π-allyl ligand more bulky, such as using ##STR65## rather than the simple π-allyl group itself. Having a Lewis acid present while using a functional π-allyl or π-benzyl group. Relatively weak Lewis acids such a triphenylborane, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, and tris(3,5-trifluoromethylphenyl)borane, are preferred. Suitable functional groups include chloro and ester. "Solid" acids such as montmorillonite may also be used.</p><p>When using (XXXVII) as a polymerization catalyst, it is preferred that ethylene and/or a linear α-olefin is the monomer, or cyclopentene, more preferred if the monomer is ethylene and/or propylene, and ethylene is especially preferred. A preferred temperature for the polymerization process using (XXXVII) is about +20 is also preferred that the partial pressure due to ethylene or propylene monomer is at least about 600 kPa. It is also noted that (XXXVII) is a novel compound, and preferred items for (XXXVII) for the polymerization process are also preferred for the compound itself.</p><p>Another catalyst for the polymerization of olefins is a compound of the formula ##STR66## and one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of ethylene, an olefin of the formula R.sup.17 CH═CH.sub.2 or R.sup.17 CH═CHR.sup.17, cyclobutene, cyclopentene, substituted norbornene, and norbornene,</p><p>wherein: R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are each independently hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 taken together are hydrocarbylene or substituted hydrocarbylene to form a ring; R.sup.54 is hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, provided that the carbon atom bound directly to the imino nitrogen atom has at least two carbon atoms bound to it; each R.sup.55 is independently hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl, or a functional group; W is alkylene or substituted alkylene containing 2 or more carbon atoms; Z is a neutral Lewis base wherein the donating atom is nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen, provided that if the donating atom is nitrogen then the pKa of the conjugate acid of that compound (measured in water) is less than about 6, or an olefin of the formula R.sup.17 CH═CHR.sup.17 ; each R.sup.17 is independently alkyl or substituted alkyl; and X is a weakly coordinating anion. It is preferred that in compound (XXXVIII) that: R.sup.54 is phenyl or substituted phenyl, and preferred substituents are alkyl groups; each R.sup.55 is independently hydrogen or alkyl containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms; W contains 2 carbon atoms between the phenyl ring and metal atom it is bonded to or W is a divalent polymeric group derived from the polymerization of R.sup.17 CH═CHR.sup.17, and it is especially preferred that it is --CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 -- or --C(CH.sub.3).sub.2 CH.sub.2 --; and Z is a dialkyl ether or an olefin of the formula R.sup.17 CH═CHR.sup.17 ; and combinations thereof.

That end of W bound to the phenyl ring actually is the original fragment from R.sup.56 from which the "bridge" W originally formed, and the remaining part of W is formed from the olefin(s) R.sup.17 CH═CHR.sup.17. In a sense this compound is similar in function to compound (VI).</p><p>By substituted phenyl in (XXXVIII) and (XXXIX) is meant the phenyl ring can be substituted with any grouping which does not interfere with the compound's stability or any of the reactions the compound undergoes. Preferred substituents in substituted phenyl are alkyl groups, preferably containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms.</p><p>Preferred monomers for this polymerization are ethylene and linear α-olefins, or cyclopentene, particularly propylene, and ethylene and propylene or both are more preferred, and ethylene is especially preferred.</p><p>It is noted that (XXXVIII) is a novel compound, and preferred compounds and groupings are the same as in the polymerization process.</p><p>Compound (XXXVIII) can be made by heating compound (XXXIX), ##STR67##</p><p>wherein: R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are each independently hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 taken together are hydrocarbylene or substituted hydrocarbylene to form a ring; R.sup.54 is hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, provided that the carbon atom bound directly to the imino nitrogen atom has at least two carbon atoms bound to it; each R.sup.55 is independently hydrogen hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl, or a functional group; R.sup.56 is alkyl containing 2 to 30 carbon atoms; T.sup.3 is alkyl; Z is a neutral Lewis base wherein the donating atom is nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen, provided that if the donating atom is nitrogen then the pKa of the conjugate acid of that compound (measured in water) is less than about 6; and X is a weakly coordinating anion. Preferred groups are the same as those in (XXXVIII). In addition it is preferred that T.sup.5 contain 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and more preferred that it is methyl. A preferred temperature for the conversion of (XXIX) to (XXXVIII) is about -30 50 the higher the temperature, the faster the reaction. Another factor which affects the reaction rate is the nature of Z. The weaker the Lewis basicity of Z, the faster the desired reaction will be.</p><p>When (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VII), (VIII) or a combination of compounds that will generate similar compound, (subject to the conditions described above) is used in the polymerization of olefins, cyclolefins, and optionally olefinic esters or carboxylic acids, polymer having what is believed to be similar to a "living end" is formed. This molecule is that from which the polymer grows to its eventual molecular weight. This compound may have the structure ##STR68## wherein: M is Ni(II) or Pd(II); R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, provided that the carbon atom bound directly to the imino nitrogen atom has at least two carbon atoms bound to it; R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are each independently hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 taken together are hydrocarbylene or substituted hydrocarbylene to form a ring; each R.sup.11 is independently hydrogen, alkyl or --(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1 ; T.sup.3 is hydrogen, hydrocarbyl not containing olefinic or acetylenic bonds, R.sup.15 (C═O)--, R.sup.15 O(C═O)--, or --CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CO.sub.2 R.sup.6 ; R.sup.15 is hydrocarbyl not containing olefinic or acetylenic unsaturation; P is a divalent group containing one or more repeat units derived from the polymerization of one or more of ethylene, an olefin of the formula R.sup.17 CH═CH.sub.2 or R.sup.17 CH═CHR.sup.17, cyclobutene, cyclopentene, substituted norbornene, or norbornene and, when M is Pd(II), optionally one or more compounds of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1 ; R.sup.8 is hydrocarbyl; each R.sup.17 is independently hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl provided that any olefinic bond in said olefin is separated from any other olefinic bond or aromatic ring by a quaternary carbon atom or at least two saturated carbon atoms; m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 16; R.sup.1 is hydrogen, or hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms; and X is a weakly coordinating anion; and that when M is Ni(II), R.sup.11 is not --CO.sub.2 R.sup.8 and when M is Pd a diene is not present. By an "olefinic ester or carboxylic acid" is meant a compound of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1, wherein m and R.sup.1 are as defined immediately above.</p><p>This molecule will react with additional monomer (olefin, cyclic olefin, olefinic ester or olefinic carboxylic acid) to cause further polymerization. In other words, the additional monomer will be added to P, extending the length of the polymer chain. Thus P may be of any size, from one "repeat unit" to many repeat units, and when the polymerization is over and P is removed from M, as by hydrolysis, P is essentially the polymer product of the polymerization. Polymerization with (VI), that is contact of additional monomer with this molecule takes place under the same conditions as described above for the polymerization process using (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VII) or (VIII), or combinations of compounds that will generate similar molecules, and where appropriate preferred conditions and structures are the same.</p><p>The group T.sup.3 in (VI) was originally the group T.sup.1 in (II) or (III), or the group which included R.sup.8 in (IV). It in essence will normally be one of the end groups of the eventual polymer product. The olefinic group which is coordinated to M, R.sup.11 CH═CHR.sup.11 is normally one of the monomers, olefin, cyclic olefin, or, if Pd(II) is M, an olefinic ester or carboxylic acid. If more than one of these monomers is present in the reaction, it may be any one of them. It is preferred that T.sup.3 is alkyl and especially preferred that it is methyl, and it is also preferred that R.sup.11 is hydrogen or n-alkyl. It is also preferred that M is Pd(II).</p><p>Another "form" for the living end is (XVI). ##STR69## This type of compound is sometimes referred to as a compound in the "agostic state". In fact both (VI) and (XVI) may coexist together in the same polymerization, both types of compound representing living ends. It is believed that (XVI)-type compounds are particularly favored when the end of the growing polymer chain bound to the transition metal is derived from a cyclic olefin such as cyclopentene. Expressed in terms of the structure of (XVI) this is when both of R.sup.11 are hydrocarbylene to form a carbocyclic ring, and it is preferred that this be a five-membered carbocyclic ring.</p><p>For both the polymerization process using (XVI) and the structure of (XVI) itself, the same conditions and groups as are used and preferred for (VI) are also used and preferred for (XVI), with the exception that for R.sup.11 it is preferred in (XVI) that both of R.sup.11 are hydrocarbylene to form a carboxylic ring.</p><p>This invention also concerns a compound of the formula ##STR70## wherein: M is Ni(II) or Pd(II); R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, provided that the carbon atom bound directly to the imino nitrogen atom has at least two carbon atoms bound to it; R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are each independently hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 taken together are hydrocarbylene or substituted hydrocarbylene to form a ring; each R.sup.14 is independently hydrogen, alkyl or [when M is Pd(II)] --(CH.sub.2).sub.m CO.sub.2 R.sup.1 ; R.sup.1 is hydrogen, or hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms; T.sup.4 is alkyl, --R.sup.60 C(O)OR.sup.8, R.sup.15 (C═O)-- or R.sup.15 OC(═O)--; R.sup.15 is hydrocarbyl not containing olefinic or acetylenic bonds; R.sup.60 is alkylene not containing olefinic or acetylenic bonds; R.sup.8 is hydrocarbyl; and X is a weakly coordinating anoin.</p><p>(IX) may also be used to polymerize olefins, cyclic olefins, and optionally olefinic esters and carboxylic acids. The same conditions (except as noted below) apply to the polymerizations using (IX) as they do for (VI). It is preferred that M is Pd(II) and T.sup.4 is methyl.</p><p>A compound of formula (V) may also be used as a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins, cyclic olefins, and optionally olefinic esters and/or carboxylic acids. In this process (V) is contacted with one or more of the essential monomers. Optionally a source of a relatively weakly coordinating anion may also be present. Such a source could be an alkali metal salt of BAF or AgX (wherein X is the anion), etc. Preferably about 1 mole of the source of X, such as AgX, will be added per mole of (V). This will usually be done in the liquid phase, preferably in which (V) and the source of the anion are at least partially soluble. The conditions of this polymerization are otherwise the same as described above for (II), (III), (IV) and (VII), including the preferred conditions and ingredients.</p><p>In polymerizations using (XX) as the catalyst, a first compound which is a source of a relatively noncoordinating monoanion is present. Such a source can be an alkali metal or silver salt of the monoanion. ##STR71## It is preferred that the alkali metal cation is sodium or potassium. It is preferred that the monoanion is SbF.sub.6.sup.-, BAF, PF.sub.6.sup.-, or BF.sub.4.sup.-, and more preferred that it is BAF. It is preferred that T.sup.1 is methyl and/or S is chlorine. All other preferred groups and conditions for these polymerizations are the same as for polymerizations with (II).</p><p>In all of the above polymerizations, and the catalysts for making them it is preferred that R.sup.2 and R.sup.5, if present, are 2,6-diisopropylphenyl and R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are hydrogen or methyl. When cyclopentene is polymerized, is preferred that R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 (if present) are 2,6-dimethylphenyl or 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl and that R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 taken together are An. R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4 and R.sup.5 and other groups herein may also be substituted hydrocarbyl. As previously defined, the substituent groups in substituted hydrocarbyl groups (there may be one or more substituent groups) should not substantially interfere with the polymerization or other reactions that the compound is undergoing. Whether a particular group will interfere can first be judged from the artisans general knowledge and the particular polymerization or other reaction that is involved. For instance, in polymerizations where an alkyl aluminum compound is used may not be compatible with the presence of groups containing an active (relatively acidic) hydrogen atom, such as hydroxyl or carboxyl because of the known reaction of alkyl aluminum compounds with such active hydrogen containing groups (but such polymerizations may be possible if enough "extra" alkyl aluminum compound is added to react with these groups). However, in very similar polymerizations where alkyl aluminum compounds are not present, these groups containing active hydrogen may be present. Indeed many of the polymerization processes described herein are remarkably tolerant to the presence of various functional groups. Probably the most important considerations as to the operability of compounds containing any particular functional group are the effect of the group on the coordination of the metal atom (if present), and side reaction of the group with other process ingredients (such as noted above). Therefore of course, the further away from the metal atom the functional group is, the less likely it is to influence, say, a polymerization. If there is doubt as to whether a particular functional group, in a particular position, will affect a reaction, simple minimal experimentation will provide the requisite answer. Functional groups which may be present in R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, R.sup.5, and other similar radicals herein include hydroxy, halo (fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo), ether, ester, dialkylamino, carboxy, oxo (keto and aldehyo), nitro, amide, thioether, and imino. Preferred functional groups are hydroxy, halo, ether and dialkylamino.</p><p>Also in all of the polymerizations, the (cyclo)olefin may be substituted hydrocarbyl. Suitable substituents include ether, keto, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid.</p><p>In all of the above polymerizations, with the exceptions noted below, the following monomer(s), to produce the corresponding homo- or copolymers, are preferred to be used: ethylene; propylene; ethylene and propylene; ethylene and an α-olefin; an α-olefin; ethylene and an alkyl acrylate, especially methyl acrylate, ethylene and acrylic acid; ethylene and carbon monoxide; ethylene, and carbon monoxide and an acrylate ester or acrylic acid, especially methyl acrylate; propylene and alkyl acrylate, especially methyl acrylate; cyclopentene; cyclopentene and ethylene; cyclopentene and propylene. Monomers which contain a carbonyl group, including esters, carboxylic acids, carbon monoxide, vinyl ketones, etc., can be polymerized with Pd(II) containing catalysts herein, with the exception of those that require the presence of a neutral or cationic Lewis acid or cationic Bronsted acid, which is usually called the "first compound" in claims describing such polymerization processes.</p><p>Another useful "monomer" for these polymerization processes is a C.sub.4 refinery catalytic cracker stream, which will often contain a mixture of n-butane, isobutane, isobutene, 1-butene, 2-butenes and small amounts of butadiene. This type of stream is referred to herein as a "crude butenes stream". This stream may act as both the monomer source and "solvent" for the polymerization. It is preferred that the concentration of 1- and 2-butenes in the stream be as high as possible, since these are the preferred compounds to be polymerized. The butadiene content should be minimized because it may be a polymerization catalyst poison. The isobutene may have been previously removed for other uses. After being used in the polymerization (during which much or most of the 1-butene would have been polymerized), the butenes stream can be returned to the refinery for further processing.</p><p>In many of the these polymerizations certain general trends may be noted, although for all of these trends there are exceptions. These trends (and exceptions) can be gleaned from the Examples.</p><p>Pressure of the monomers (especially gaseous monomers such as ethylene) has an effect on the polymerizations in many instances. Higher pressure often affects the polymer microstructure by reducing branching, especially in ethylene containing polymers. This effect is more pronounced for Ni catalysts than Pd catalysts. Under certain conditions higher pressures also seem to give higher productivities and higher molecular weight. When an acrylate is present and a Pd catalyst is used, increasing pressure seems to decrease the acrylate content in the resulting copolymer.</p><p>Temperature also affects these polymerizations. Higher temperature usually increases branching with Ni catalysts, but often has little such effect using Pd catalysts. With Ni catalysts, higher temperatures appear to often decrease molecular weight. With Pd catalysts, when acrylates are present, increasing temperature usually increases the acrylate content of the polymer, but also often decreases the productivity and molecular weight of the polymer.</p><p>Anions surprisingly also often affect molecular weight of the polymer formed. More highly coordinating anions often give lower molecular weight polymers. Although all of the anions useful herein are relatively weakly coordinating, some are more strongly coordinating than others. The coordinating ability of such anions is known and has been discussed in the literature, see for instance W. Beck., et al., Chem. Rev., vol. 88 p. 1405-1421 (1988), and S. H. Strauss, Chem. Rev., vol. 93, p. 927-942 (1993), both of which are hereby included by reference. The results found herein in which the molecular weight of the polymer produced is related to the coordinating ability of the anion used, is in line with the coordinating abilities of these anions as described in Beck (p. 1411) and Strauss (p. 932, Table II).</p><p>In addition to the "traditional" weakly coordinating anions cited in the paragraph immediately above, heterogeneous anions may also be employed. In these cases, the true nature of the counterion is poorly defined or unknown. Included in this group are MAO, MMAO and related aluminoxanes which do not form true solutions. The resulting counterions are thought to bear anionic aluminate moieties related to those cited in the paragraph immediately above. Polymeric anionic materials such as Nafion polyfluorosulfonic acid can function as non-coordinating counterions. In addition, a wide variety of heterogeneous inorganic materials can be made to function as non-coordinating counterions. Examples would include aluminas, silicas, silica/aluminas, cordierites, clays, MgCl.sub.2, and many others utilized as traditional supports for Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization catalysts. These are generally materials which have Lewis or Bronsted acidity. High surface area is usually desired and often these materials will have been activated through some heating process. Heating may remove excess surface water and change the surface acidity from Bronsted to Lewis type. Materials which are not active in the role may often be made active by surface treatment. For instance, a surface-hydrated silica, zinc oxide or carbon can be treated with an organoaluminum compound to provide the required functionality.</p><p>The catalysts described herein can be heterogenized through a variety of means. The heterogeneous anions in the paragraph immediately above will all serve to heterogenize the catalysts. Catalysts can also be heterogenized by exposing them to small quantities of a monomer to encapsulate them in a polymeric material through which additional monomers will diffuse. Another method is to spray-dry the catalyst with its suitable non-coordinating counterion onto a polymeric support. Heterogeneous versions of the catalyst are particularly useful for running gas-phase polymerizations. The catalyst is suitably diluted and dispersed on the surface of the catalyst support to control the heat of polymerization. When applied to fluidized-bed polymerizations, the heterogeneous supports provide a convenient means of catalyst introduction.</p><p>Another item may effect the incorporation of polar monomers such as acrylic esters in olefin copolymers. It has been found that catalysts containing less bulky α-diimines incorporate more of the polar monomer into the polymer (one obtains a polymer with a higher percentage of polar monomer) than a catalyst containing a more bulky α-diimine, particularly when ethylene is the olefin comonomer. For instance, in an α-diimine of formula (VIII), if R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are 2,6-dimethylphenyl instead of 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, more acrylic monomer will be incorporated into the polymer. However, another common effect of using a less bulky catalyst is to produce a polymer with lower molecular weight. Therefore one may have to make a compromise between polar monomer content in the polymer and polymer molecular weight.</p><p>When an olefinic carboxylic acid is polymerized into the polymer, the polymer will of course contain carboxyl groups. Similarly in an ester containing polymer, some or all of the ester groups may be hydrolyzed to carboxyl groups (and vice versa). The carboxyl groups may be partially or completely converted into salts such as metallic salts. Such polymeric salts are termed ionomers. Ionomers are useful in adhesives, as ionomeric elastomers, and as molding resins. Salts may be made with ions of metals such as Na, K, Zn, Mg, Al, etc. The polymeric salts may be made by methods known to the artisan, for instance reaction of the carboxylic acid containing polymers with various compounds of the metals such as bases (hydroxides, carbonates, etc.) or other compounds, such as acetylacetonates. Novel polymers that contain carboxylic acid groups herein, also form novel ionomers when the carboxylic acid groups are partially or fully converted to carboxylate salts.</p><p>When copolymers of an olefinic carboxylic acid or olefinic ester and selected olefins are made, they may be crosslinked by various methods known in the art, depending on the specific monomers used to make the polymer. For instance, carboxyl or ester containing polymers may be crosslinked by reaction with diamines to form bisamides. Certain functional groups which may be present on the polymer may be induced to react to crosslink the polymer. For instance epoxy groups (which may be present as glycidyl esters) may be crosslinked by reaction of the epoxy groups, see for instance Example 135.</p><p>It has also been found that certain fluorinated olefins, some of them containing other functional groups may be polymerized by nickel and palladium catalysts. Note that these fluorinated olefins are included within the definition of H.sub.2 C═CHR.sup.17, wherein R.sup.17 can be considered to be substituted hydrocarbyl, the substitution being fluorine and possibly other substituents. Olefins which may be polymerized include H.sub.2 C═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a R.sub.f R.sup.42 wherein a is an integer of 2 to 20, R.sub.f is perfluoroalkylene optionally containing one or more ether groups, and R.sup.42 is fluorine or a functional group. Suitable functional groups include hydrogen, chlorine, bromine or iodine, ester, sulfonic acid (-SO.sub.3 H), and sulfonyl halide. Preferred groups for R.sup.42 include fluorine, ester, sulfonic acid, and sulfonyl fluoride. A sulfonic acid group containing monomer does not have to be polymerized directly. It is preferably made by hydrolysis of a sulfonyl halide group already present in an already made polymer. It is preferred that the perfluoroalkylene group contain 2 to 20 carbon atoms and preferred perfluoroalkylene groups are --(CF.sub.2).sub.b -- wherein b is 2 to 20, and --(CF.sub.2).sub.d OCF.sub.2 CF.sub.2 -- wherein d is 2 to 20. A preferred olefinic comonomer is ethylene or a linear α-olefin, and ethylene is especially preferred. Polymerizations may be carried out with many of the catalysts described herein, see Examples 284 to 293.</p><p>As described herein, the resulting fluorinated polymers often don't contain the expected amount of branching, and/or the lengths of the branches present are not those expected for a simple vinyl polymerization.</p><p>The resulting polymers may be useful for compatibilizing fluorinated and nonfluorinated polymers, for changing the surface characteristics of fluorinated or nonfluorinated polymers (by being mixed with them), as molding resins, etc. Those polymers containing functional groups may be useful where those functional groups may react or be catalysts. For instance, if a polymer is made with a sulfonyl fluoride group (R.sup.42 is sulfonyl fluoride) that group may be hydrolyzed to a sulfonic acid, which being highly fluorinated is well known to be a very strong acid. Thus the polymer may be used as an acid catalyst, for example for the polymerization of cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran.</p><p>In this use it has been found that this polymer is more effective than a completely fluorinated sulfonic acid containing polymer. For such uses the sulfonic acid content need not be high, say only 1 to 20 mole percent, preferably about 2 to 10 mole percent of the repeat units in the polymer having sulfonic acid groups. The polymer may be crosslinked, in which case it may be soluble in the medium (for instance tetrahydrofuran), or it may be crosslinked so it swollen but not dissolved by the medium, Or it may be coated onto a substrate and optionally chemically attached and/or crosslinked, so it may easily be separated from the other process ingredients.</p><p>One of the monomers that may be polymerized by the above catalysts is ethylene (E), either by itself to form a homopolymer, or with α-olefins and/or olefinic esters or carboxylic acids. The structure of the polymer may be unique in terms of several measurable properties.</p><p>These polymers, and others herein, can have unique structure in terms of the branching in the polymer. Branching may be determined by NMR spectroscopy (see the Examples for details), and this analysis can determine the total number of branches, and to some extent the length of the branches. Herein the amount of branching is expressed as the number of branches per 1000 of the total methylene (--CH.sub.2 --) groups in the polymer, with one exception. Methylene groups that are in an ester grouping, i.e. --CO.sub.2 R, are not counted as part of the 1000 methylene. These methylene groups include those in the main chain and in the branches. These polymers, which are E homopolymers, have a branch content of about 80 to about 150 branches per 1000 methylene groups, preferably about 100 to about 130 branches per 1000 methylene groups. These branches do not include polymer end groups. In addition the distribution of the sizes (lengths) of the branches is unique. Of the above total branches, for every 100 that are methyl, about 30 to about 90 are ethyl, about 4 to about 20 are propyl, about 15 to about 50 butyl, about 3 to about 15 are amyl, and about 30 to about 140 are hexyl or longer, and it is preferred that for every 100 that are methyl, about 50 to about 70 are ethyl, about 5 to about 15 are propyl, about 24 to about 40 are butyl, about 5 to 10 are amyl, and about 65 to about 120 are hexyl or larger. These E homopolymers are often amorphous, although in some there may be a small amount of crystallinity.</p><p>Another polyolefin, which is an E homopolymer that can be made by these catalysts has about 20 to about 150 branches per 1000 methylene groups, and, per 100 methyl groups, about 4 to about 20 ethyl groups, about 1 to about 12 propyl groups, about 1 to about 12 butyl group, about 1 to about 10 amyl groups, and 0 to about 20 hexyl or larger groups. Preferably this polymer has about 40 to about 100 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups, and per 100 methyl groups, about 6 to about 15 ethyl groups, about 2 to about 10 propyl groups, about 2 to about 10 butyl groups, about 2 to about 8 amyl groups, and about 2 to about 15 hexyl or larger groups.</p><p>Many of the polyolefins herein, including homopolyethylenes, may be crosslinked by various methods known in the art, for instance by the use of peroxide or other radical generating species which can crosslink these polymers. Such crosslinked polymers are novel when the uncrosslinked polymers from which they are derived are novel, because for the most part the structural feature(s) of the uncrosslinked polymers which make them novel will be carried over into the crosslinked forms.</p><p>In addition, some of the E homopolymers have an exceptionally low density, less than about 0.86 g/mL, preferably about 0.85 g/mL or less, measured at 25</p><p>Homopolymers of polypropylene (P) can also have unusual structures. Similar effects have been observed with other α-olefins (e.g. 1-hexene). A "normal" P homopolymer will have one methyl group for each methylene group (or 1000 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups), since the normal repeat unit is --CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 --. However, using a catalyst of formula (I) in which M is Ni(II) in combination with an alkyl aluminum compound it is possible to produce a P homopolymer with about 400 to about 600 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups, preferably about 450 to about 550 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups. Similar effects have been observed with other α-olefins (e.g. 1-hexene).</p><p>In the polymerization processes described herein olefinic esters and/or carboxylic acids may also be present, and of course become part of the copolymer formed. These esters may be copolymerized with one or more of E and one or more α-olefins. When copolymerized with E alone polymers with unique structures may be formed.</p><p>In many such E/olefinic ester and/or carboxlic acid copolymers the overall branching level and the distribution of branches of various sizes are unusual. In addition, where and how the esters or carboxylic acids occur in the polymer is also unusual. A relatively high proportion of the repeat units derived from the olefinic esters are at the ends of branches. In such copolymers, it is preferred that the repeat units derived from the olefinic esters and carboxylic acids are about 0.1 to 40 mole percent of the total repeat units, more preferably about 1 to about 20 mole percent. In a preferred ester, m is 0 and R.sup.1 is hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl. It is preferred that R.sup.1 is alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferred that it contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and especially preferred that R.sup.1 is methyl.</p><p>One such preferred dipolymer has about 60 to 100 methyl groups (excluding methyl groups which are esters) per 1000 methylene groups in the polymer, and contains, per 100 methyl branches, about 45 to about 65 ethyl branches, about 1 to about 3 propyl branches, about 3 to about 10 butyl branches, about 1 to about 3 amyl branches, and about 15 to about 25 hexyl or longer branches. In addition, the ester and carboxylic acid containing repeat units are often distributed mostly at the ends of the branches as follows. If the branches, and the carbon atom to which they are attached to the main chain, are of the formula --CH(CH.sub.2).sub.n CO.sub.2 R.sup.1, wherein the CH is part of the main chain, then in some of these polymers about 40 to about 50 mole percent of ester groups are found in branches where n is 5 or more, about 10 to about 20 mole percent when n is 4, about 20 to 30 mole percent when n is 1, 2 and 3 and about 5 to about 15 mole percent when n is 0. When n is 0, an acrylate ester has polymerized "normally" as part of the main chain, with the repeat unit --CH.sub.2 --CHCO.sub.2 R.sup.1 --.</p><p>These branched polymers which contain olefin and olefinic ester monomer units, particularly copolymers of ethylene and methyl acrylate and/or other acrylic esters are particularly useful as viscosity modifiers for lubricating oils, particularly automotive lubricating oils.</p><p>Under certain polymerization conditions, some of the polymerization catalysts described herein produce polymers whose structure is unusual, especially considering from what compounds (monomers) the polymers were made, and the fact that polymerization catalysts used herein are so-called transition metal coordination catalysts (more than one compound may be involved in the catalyst system, one of which must include a transition metal). Some of these polymers were described in a somewhat different way above, and they may be described as "polyolefins" even though they may contain other monomer units which are not olefins (e.g., olefinic esters). in the polymerization of an unsaturated compound of the formula H.sub.2 C═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.e G, wherein e is 0 or an integer of 1 or more, and G is hydrogen or --CO.sub.2 R.sup.1, the usual ("normal") polymeric repeat unit obtained would be --CH.sub.2 --CH[(CH.sub.2).sub.e G]--, wherein the branch has the formula --(CH.sub.2).sub.e G. However, with some of the instant catalysts a polymeric unit may be --CH.sub.2 --CH[(CH.sub.2).sub.f G]--, wherein f≠e, and f is 0 or an integer of 1 or more. If f&amp;lt;e, the "extra" methylene groups may be part of the main polymer chain. If f&amp;gt;e (parts of) additional monomer molecules may be incorporated into that branch. In other words, the structure of any polymeric unit may be irregular and different for monomer molecules incorporated into the polymer, and the structure of such a polymeric unit obtained could be rationalized as the result of "migration of the active polymerizing site" up and down the polymer chain, although this may not be the actual mechanism. This is highly unusual, particularly for polymerizations employing transition metal coordination catalysts.</p><p>For "normal" polymerizations, wherein the polymeric unit --CH.sub.2 --CH[(CH.sub.2).sub.e G]-- is obtained, the theoretical amount of branching, as measured by the number of branches per 1000 methylene (--CH.sub.2 --) groups can be calculated as follows which defines terms "theoretical branches" or "theoretical branching" herein: ##EQU1## In this equation, an α-olefin is any olefinic compound H.sub.2 C═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.e G wherein e≠0. Ethylene or an acrylic compound are the cases wherein e=0. Thus to calculate the number of theoretical branches in a polymer made from 50 mole percent ethylene (e=0), 30 mole percent propylene (e=1) and 20 mole percent methyl 5-heptenoate (e=4) would be as follows: ##EQU2## The "1000 methylenes" include all of the methylene groups in the polymer, including methylene groups in the branches.</p><p>For some of the polymerizations described herein, the actual amount of branching present in the polymer is considerably greater than or less than the above theoretical branching calculations would indicate. For instance, when an ethylene homopolymer is made, there should be no branches, yet there are often many such branches. When an α-olefin is polymerized, the branching level may be much lower or higher than the theoretical branching level. It is preferred that the actual branching level is at 90% of less of the theoretical branching level, more preferably about 80% or less of the theoretical branching level, or 110% or more of the theoretical branching level, more preferably about 120% or more of the theoretical branching level. The polymer should also have at least about 50 branches per 1000 methylene units, preferably about 75 branches per 1000 methylene units, and more preferably about 100 branches per 1000 methylene units. In cases where there are "0" branches theoretically present, as in ethylene homopolymers or copolymers with acrylics, excess branches as a percentage cannot be calculated. In that instance if the polymer has 50 or more, preferably 75 or more branches per 1000 methylene groups, it has excess branches (i.e. in branches in which f&amp;gt;0).</p><p>These polymers also have "at least two branches of different lengths containing less than 6 carbon atoms each." By this is meant that branches of at least two different lengths (i.e. number of carbon atoms), and containing less than 6 carbon atoms, are present in the polymer. For instance the polymer may contain ethyl and butyl branches, or methyl and amyl branches.</p><p>As will be understood from the above discussion, the lengths of the branches ("f") do not necessarily correspond to the original sizes of the monomers used ("e"). Indeed branch lengths are often present which do not correspond to the sizes of any of the monomers used and/or a branch length may be present "in excess". By "in excess" is meant there are more branches of a particular length present than there were monomers which corresponded to that branch length in the polymer. For instance, in the copolymerization of 75 mole percent ethylene and 25 mole percent 1-butene it would be expected that there would be 125 ethyl branches per 1000 methylene carbon atoms. If there were more ethyl branches than that, they would be in excess compared to the theoretical branching. There may also be a deficit of specific length branches. If there were less than 125 ethyl branches per 1000 methylene groups in this polymer there would be a deficit. Preferred polymers have 90% or less or 110% or more of the theoretical amount of any branch length present in the polymer, and it is especially preferred if these branches are about 80% or less or about 120% or more of the theoretical amount of any branch length. In the case of the 75 mole percent ethylene/25 mole percent 1-butene polymer the 90% would be about 113 ethyl branches or less, while the 110% would be about 138 ethyl branches or more. Such polymers may also or exclusively contain at least 50 branches per 1000 methylene atoms with lengths which should not theoretically (as described above) be present at all.</p><p>These polymers also have "at least two branches of different lengths containing less than 6 carbon atoms each." By this is meant that branches of at least two different lengths (i.e. number of carbon atoms), and containing less than 6 carbon atoms, are present in the polymer. For instance the polymer may contain ethyl and butyl branches, or methyl and amyl branches.</p><p>Some of the polymers produced herein are novel because of unusual structural features. Normally, in polymers of alpha-olefins of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a H wherein a is an integer of 2 or more made by coordination polymerization, the most abundant, and often the only, branches present in such polymers have the structure --(CH.sub.2).sub.1 H. Some of the polymers produced herein are novel because methyl branches comprise about 25% to about 75% of the total branches in the polymer. Such polymers are described in Examples 139, 162, 173 and 243-245. Some of the polymers produced herein are novel because in addition to having a high percentage (25-75%) of methyl branches (of the total branches present), they also contain linear branches of the structure --(CH.sub.2).sub.n H wherein n is an integer of six or greater. Such polymers are described in Examples 139, 173 and 243-245. Some of the polymers produced herein are novel because in addition to having a high percentage (25-75%) of methyl branches (of the total branches present), they also contain the structure (XXVI), preferably in amounts greater than can be accounted for by end groups, and more preferably greater than 0.5 (XXVI) groups per thousand methyl groups in the polymer greater than can be accounted for by end groups. ##STR72##</p><p>Normally, homo- and copolymers of one or more alpha-olefins of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a H wherein a is an integer of 2 or more contain as part of the polymer backbone the structure (XXV) ##STR73## wherein R.sup.35 and R.sup.36 are alkyl groups. In most such polymers of alpha-olefins of this formula (especially those produced by coordination-type polymerizations), both of R.sup.35 and R.sup.36 are --(CH.sub.2).sub.a H. However, in certain of these polymers described herein, about 2 mole percent or more, preferably about 5 mole percent or more and more preferably about 50 mole percent or more of the total amount of (XXV) in said polymer consists of the structure where one of R.sup.35 and R.sup.36 is a methyl group and the other is an alkyl group containing two or more carbon atoms. Furthermore, in certain of these polymers described herein, structure (XXV) may occur in side chains as well as in the polymer backbone. Structure (XXV) can be detected by the .sup.13 C NMR. The signal for the carbon atom of the methylene group between the two methine carbons in (XXV) usually occurs in the .sup.13 C NMR at 41.9 to 44.0 ppm when one of R.sup.35 and R.sup.36 is a methyl group and the other is an alkyl group containing two or more carbon atoms, while when both R.sup.35 and R.sup.36 contain 2 or more carbon atoms, the signal for the methylene carbon atom occurs at 39.5 to 41.9 ppm. Integration provides the relative amounts of these structures present in the polymer. If there are interfering signals from other carbon atoms in these regions, they must be subtracted from the total integrals to give correct values for structure (XXV).</p><p>Normally, homo- and copolymers of one or more alpha-olefins of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a H wherein a is an integer of 2 or more (especially those made by coordination polymerization) contain as part of the polymer backbone structure (XXIV) wherein n is 0, 1, or 2. When n is 0, this structure is termed "head to head" polymerization. When n is 1, this structure is termed "head to tail" polymerization. When n is 2, this structure is termed "tail to tail" polymerization. In most such polymers of alpha-olefins of this formula (especially those produced by coordination-type polymerizations), both of R.sup.37 and R.sup.38 are --(CH.sub.2).sub.a H. However some of the polymers of alpha-olefins of this formula described herein are novel in that they also contain structure (XXIV) wherein n=a, R.sup.37 is a methyl group, and R.sup.38 is an alkyl group with 2 or more carbon atoms. ##STR74##</p><p>Normally polyethylene made by coordination polymerization has a linear backbone with either no branching, or small amounts of linear branches. Some of the polyethylenes described herein are unusual in that they contain structure (XXVII) which has a methine carbon that is not part of the main polymer backbone. ##STR75##</p><p>Normally, polypropylene made by coordination polymerization has methyl branches and few if any branches of other sizes. Some of the polypropylenes described herein are unusual in that they contain one or both of the structures (XXVIII) and (XXIX). ##STR76##</p><p>As the artisan understands, in coordination polymerization alpha-olefins of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a H may insert into the growing polymer chain in a 1,2 or 2,1 manner. Normally these insertion steps lead to 1,2- enchainment or 2,1-enchainment of the monomer. Both of these fundamental steps form a --(CH.sub.2).sub.a H branch. However, with some catalysts herein, some of the initial product of 1,2 insertion can rearrange by migration of the coordinated metal atom to the end of the last inserted monomer before insertion of additional monomer occurs. This results in omega,2-enchainment and the formation of a methyl branch. ##STR77##</p><p>It is also known that with certain other catalysts, some of the initial product of 2,1 insertion can rearrange in a similar manner by migration of the coordinated metal atom to the end of the last inserted monomer. This results in omega,1-enchainment and no branch is formed. ##STR78##</p><p>Of the four types of alpha-olefin enchainment, omega,1-enchainment is unique in that it does not generate a branch. In a polymer made from an alpha-olefin of the formula CH.sub.2 ═CH(CH.sub.2).sub.a H, the total number of branches per 1000 methylene groups (B) can be expressed as:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->B=(1000)(1-X.sub.ω,1)/[(1-X.sub.ω,1)a+X.sub.ω,1 (a+2)]</pre></p><p>where X.sub.ω,1 is the fraction of omega,1-enchainment.</p><p>Solving this expression for X.sub.ω,1 gives:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->X.sub.ω,1 =(1000-aB)/(1000+2B)</pre></p><p>This equation provides a means of calculating the fraction of omega,1-enchainment in a polymer of a linear alpha-olefin from the total branching B. Total branching can be measured by .sup.1 H NMR or .sup.13 C NMR. Similar equations can be written for branched alpha-olefins. For example, the equation for 4-methyl-1-pentene is:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->X.sub.ω,1 =(2000-2B)/(1000+2B)</pre></p><p>Most polymers of alpha-olefins made by other coordination polymerization methods have less than 5% omega,1-enchainment. Some of the alpha-olefin polymers described herein have unusually large amounts (say &amp;gt;5%) of omega,1-enchainment. In essence this is similar to stating that a polymer made from an α-olefin has much less than the "expected" amount of branching. Although many of the polymerizations described herein give substantial amounts of ω,1- and other unusual forms of enchainment of olefinic monomers, it has surprisingly been found that "unsymmetrical" α-diimine ligands of formula (VIII) give especially high amounts of ω,1-enchainment. In particular when R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are phenyl, and one or both of these is substituted in such a way as different sized groups are present in the 2 and 6 position of the phenyl ring(s), ω,1-enchainment is enhanced. For instance, if one or both of R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are 2-t-butylphenyl, this enchainment is enhanced. In this context when R.sup.2 and/or R.sup.5 are "substituted" phenyl the substitution may be not only in the 2 and/or 6 positions, but on any other position in the phenyl ring. For instance, 2,5-di-t-butylphenyl, and 2-t-butyl-4,6-dichlorophenyl would be included in substituted phenyl.</p><p>The steric effect of various groupings has been quantified by a parameter called E.sub.s, see R. W. Taft, Jr., J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. 74, p. 3120-3128, and M. S. Newman, Steric Effects in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1956, p. 598-603. For the purposes herein, the E.sub.s values are those for o-substituted benzoates described in these publications. If the value for E.sub.s for any particular group is not known, it can be determined by methods described in these publications. For the purposes herein, the value of hydrogen is defined to be the same as for methyl. It is preferred that difference in E.sub.s, when R.sup.2 (and preferably also R.sup.5) is phenyl, between the groups substituted in the 2 and 6 positions of the phenyl ring is at least 0.15, more preferably at least about 0.20, and especially preferably about 0.6 or more. These phenyl groups may be unsubstituted or substituted in any other manner in the 3, 4 or 5 positions.</p><p>These differences in E.sub.s are preferred in a diimine such as (VIII), and in any of the polymerization processes herein wherein a metal complex containing an α-diimine ligand is used or formed. The synthesis and use of such α-diimines is illustrated in Examples 454-463.</p><p>Because of the relatively large amounts of ω,1-enchainment that may be obtained using some of the polymerization catalysts reported herein novel polymers can be made. Among these homopolypropylene (PP). In some of the PP's made herein the structure ##STR79## may be found. In this structure each C.sup.a is a methine carbon atom that is a branch point, while each C.sup.b is a methylene group that is more than 3 carbon atoms removed from any branch point (C.sup.a). Herein methylene groups of the type --C.sup.b H.sub.2 -- are termed δ+ (or delta+) methylene groups. Methylene groups of the type --C.sup.d H.sub.2 --, which are exactly the third carbon atom from a branch point, are termed γ (gamma) methylene groups. The NMR signal for the δ+ methylene groups occurs at about 29.75 ppm, while the NMR signal for the γ methylene groups appears at about 30.15 ppm. Ratios of these types of methylene groups to each other and the total number of methylene groups in the PP is done by the usual NMR integration techniques.</p><p>It is preferred that PP's made herein have about 25 to about 300 δ+ methylene groups per 1000 methylene groups (total) in the PP.</p><p>It is also preferred that the ratio of δ+:γ methylene groups in the PP be 0.7 to about 2</p><p>The above ratios involving δ+ and γ methylene groups in PP are of course due to the fact that high relatively high ω,1 enchainment can be obtained. It is preferred that about 30 to 60 mole percent of the monomer units in PP be enchained in an ω,1 fashion. Using the above equation, the percent ω,1 enchainment for polypropylene can be calculated as:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->% ω,1=(100)(1000-B)/(1000+2B)</pre></p><p>wherein B is the total branching (number of methyl groups) per 1000 methylene groups in the polymer.</p> <p>Homo- or copolymers of one or more linear α-olefins containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms may also have δ+ carbon atoms in them, preferably at least about 1 or more δ+ carbon atoms per 1000 methylene groups.</p><p>The above polymerization processes can of course be used to make relatively random copolymers (except for certain CO copolymers) of various possible monomers. However, some of them can also be used to make block polymers. A block polymer is conventionally defined as a polymer comprising molecules in which there is a linear arrangement of blocks, a block being a portion of a polymer molecule which the monomeric units have at least one constitutional or configurational feature absent from adjacent portions (definition from H. Mark, et al., Ed., Encyclopedia of Sons, New York, 1985, p. 324). Herein in a block copolymer, the constitional difference is a difference in monomer units used to make that block, while in a block homopolymer the same monomer(s) are used but the repeat units making up different blocks are different structure and/or ratios of types of structures.</p><p>Since it is believed that many of the polymerization processes herein have characteristics that often resemble those of living polymerizations, making block polymers may be relatively easy. One method is to simply allow monomer(s) that are being polymerized to be depleted to a low level, and then adding different monomer(s) or the same combination of monomers in different ratios. This process may be repeated to obtain polymers with many blocks.</p><p>Lower temperatures, say about less than 0 -10 the polymerizations. Under these conditions narrow molecular weight distribution polymers may be obtained (see Examples 367-369 and 371), and block copolymers may also be made (Example 370).</p><p>As pointed out above, certain polymerization conditions, such as pressure, affect the microstructure of many polymers. The microstructure in turn affects many polymer properties, such as crystallization. Thus, by changing polymerization conditions, such as the pressure, one can change the microstructure of the part of the polymer made under those conditions. This of course leads to a block polymer, a polymer have defined portions having structures different from other defined portions. This may be done with more than one monomer to obtain a block copolymer, or may be done with a single monomer or single mixture of monomers to obtain a block homopolymer. For instance, in the polymerization of ethylene, high pressure sometime leads to crystalline polymers, while lower pressures give amorphous polymers. Changing the pressure repeatedly could lead to an ethylene homopolymer containing blocks of amorphous polyethylene and blocks of crystalline polyethylene. If the blocks were of the correct size, and there were enough of them, a thermoplastic elastomeric homopolyethylene could be produced. Similar polymers could possibly be made from other monomer(s), such as propylene.</p> <p>Homopolymers of α-olefins such as propylene, that is polymers which were made from a monomer that consisted essentially of a single monomer such as propylene, which are made herein, sometimes exhibit unusual properties compared to their "normal" homopolymers. For instance, such a homopolypropylene usually would have about 1000 methyl groups per 1000 methylene groups. Polypropylenes made herein typically have about half that many methyl groups, and in addition have some longer chain branches. Other α-olefins often give polymers whose microstructure is analogous to these polypropylenes when the above catalysts are used for the polymerization.</p> <p>These polypropylenes often exhibit exceptionally low glass transition temperatures (TG's). "Normal" polypropylene has a Tg of about -17 C., but the polypropylene herein have a Tg of -30 preferably about -35 -40 Calorimetry at a heating rate of 10 the midpoint of the transition. These polypropylenes preferably have at least 50 branches (methyl groups) per 1000 carbon atoms, more preferably at least about 100 branches per 1000 methylene groups.</p> <p>Previously, when cyclopentene was coordination polymerized to higher molecular weights, the resulting polymer was essentially intractable because of its very high melting point, greatly above 300 the catalysts here to homopolymerize cyclopentene results in a polymer that is tractable, i.e., may be reformed, as by melt forming. Such polymers have an end of melting point of about 320 preferably about 300 275 melting point is determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry at a heating rate of 15 endotherm as the melting point. However these polymers tend to have relatively diffuse melting points, so it is preferred to measure the "melting point" by the end of melting point. The method is the same, except the end of melting is taken as the end (high temperature end) of the melting endotherm which is taken as the point at which the DSC signal returns to the original (extrapolated) baseline. Such polymers have an average degree of polymerization (average number of cyclopentene repeat units per polymer chain) of about 10 or more, preferably about 30 or more, and more preferably about 50 or more.</p><p>In these polymers, enchainment of the cyclopentene repeat units is usually as cis-1,3-pentylene units, in contrast to many prior art cyclopentenes which were enchained as 1,2-cyclopentylene units. It is preferred that about 90 mole percent or more, more preferably about 95 mole percent or more of the enchained cyclopentene units be enchained as 1,3-cyclopentylene units, which are preferably cis-1,3-cyclopentylene units.</p><p>The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the instant poly(cyclopentenes) is also unique. To produce cyclopentene polymer samples of uniform thickness for X-ray measurements, powder samples were compressed into disks approximately 1 mm thick and 32 mm in diameter. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the samples were collected over the range 10-50 2θ. The diffraction data were collected using an automated Philips θ--θ diffractometer (Philips X'pert System) operating in the symmetrical transmission mode (Ni-filtered CuKa radiation, equipped with a diffracted beam collimator (Philips Thin Film Collimator system), Xe filled proportional detector, fixed step mode (0.05.degree./step), 12.5 sec./step, 1/4 identified using the peak finding routine in the APD suite of programs provided with the X'pert System. THe X-ray powder diffraction pattern had reflections at approximately 17.3.degree., 19.3.degree., 24.2.degree., and 40.7.degree. 2θ, which correspond to d-spacings of approximately 0.512, 0.460, 0.368 and 0.222 nm, respectively. These polymers have a monoclinic unit cell of the approximate dimensions: a=0.561 nm; b=0.607 nm; c=7.37 nm; and g=123.2.degree..</p><p>Copolymers of cyclopentene and various other olefins may also be made. For instance a copolymer of ethylene and cyclopentene may also be made. In such a copolymer it is preferred that at least 50 mole percent, more preferably at least about 70 mole percent, of the repeat units are derived from cyclopentene. As also noted above, many of the polymerization systems described herein produce polyethylenes that have considerable branching in them. Likewise the ethylene units which are copolymerized with the cyclopentene herein may also be branched, so it is preferred that there be at least 20 branches per 1000 methylene carbon atoms in such copolymers. In this instance, the "methylene carbon atoms" referred to in the previous sentence do not include methylene groups in the cyclopentene rings. Rather it includes methylene groups only derived from ethylene or other olefin, but not cyclopentene.</p><p>Another copolymer that may be prepared is one from cyclopentene and an α-olefin, more preferably a linear α-olefin. It is preferred in such copolymers that repeat units derived from cyclopentene are 50 mole percent or more of the repeat units. As mentioned above, α-olefins may be enchained in a 1,ω fashion, and it is preferred that at least 10 mole percent of the repeat units derived from the α-olefin be enchained in such a fashion. Ethylene may also be copolymerized with the cyclopentene and α-olefin.</p><p>Poly(cyclopentene) and copolymers of cyclopentene, especially those that are (semi)crystalline, may be used as molding and extrusion resins. They may contain various materials normally found in resins, such as fillers, reinforcing agents, antioxidants, antiozonants, pigments, tougheners, compatibilizers, dyes, flame retardant, and the like. These polymers may also be drawn or melt spun into fibers. Suitable tougheners and compatibilizers include polycyclopentene resin which has been grafted with maleic anhydride, an grafted EPDM rubber, a grafted EP rubber, a functionalized styrene/butadiene rubber, or other rubber which has been modified to selectively bond to components of the two phases.</p><p>In all of the above homo- and copolymers of cyclopentene, where appropriate, any of the preferred state may be combined any other preferred state(s).</p><p>The homo- and copolymers of cyclopentene described above may used or made into certain forms as described below:</p><p>1. THe cyclopentene polymers described above may be part of a polymer blend. That is they may be mixed in any proportion with one or more other polymers which may be thermoplastics and/or elastomers. Suitable polymers for blends are listed below in the listing for blends of other polymers described herein. One preferred type of polymer which may be blended is a toughening agent or compatibilizer, which is often elastomeric and/or contains functional groups which may help compatibilize the mixture, such as epoxy or carboxyl.</p><p>2. The polycyclopentenes described herein are useful in a nonwoven fabric comprising fibrillated three-dimensional network fibers prepared by using of a polycyclopentene resin as the principal component. It can be made by flash-spinning a homogeneous solution containing a polycyclopentene. The resultant nonwoven fabric is excellent in heat resistance, dimensional stability and solvent resistance.</p><p>3. A shaped part of any of the cyclopentene containing resins. This part may be formed by injection molding, extrusion, and thermoforming. Exemplary uses include molded part for automotive use, medical treatment container, microwave-range container, food package container such as hot packing container, oven container, retort container, etc., and heat-resisting transparent container such as heat-resisting bottle.</p><p>4. A sheet or film of any of the cyclopentene containing resins. This sheet or film may be clear and may be used for optical purposes (i.e. breakage resistant glazing). The sheet or film may be oriented or unoriented. Orientation may be carried out by any of the known methods such a uniaxial or biaxial drawing. The sheet or film may be stampable or theroformable.</p><p>5. The polycyclopentene resins are useful in nonwoven fabrics or microfibers which are produced by melt-blowing a material containing as a main component a polycyclopentene. A melt-blowing process for producing a fabric or fiber comprises supplying a polycyclopentene in a molten form from at least one orifice of a nozzle into a gas stream which attenuates the molten polymer into microfibers. The nonwoven fabrics are excellent in heat-resistant and chemical resistant characteristics, and are suitable for use as medical fabrics, industrial filters, battery separators and so forth. The microfibers are particularly useful in the field of high temperature filtration, coalescing and insulation.</p><p>6. A laminate in which one or more of the layers comprises a cyclopentene resin. The laminate may also contain adhesives, and other polymers in some or all of the layers, or other materials such as paper, metal foil, etc. Some or all of the layers, may be oriented in the same or different directions. The laminate as a whole may also be oriented. Such materials are useful for containers, or other uses where barrier properties are required.</p><p>7. A fiber of a cyclopentene polymer. This fiber may be undrawn or drawn to further orient it. It is useful for apparel and in industrial application where heat resistance and/or chemical resistance are important.</p><p>8. A foam or foamed object of a cyclopentene polymer. The foam may be formed in any conventional manner such as by using blowing agents.</p><p>9. The cyclopentene resins may be microporous membranes. They may be used in process wherein semi-permeable membranes are normally used.</p><p>In addition, the cyclopentene resins may be treated or mixed with other materials to improve certain properties, as follows:</p><p>1. They may further be irradiated with electron rays. This often improves heat resistance and/or chemical resistance, and is relatively inexpensive. Thus the molding is useful as a material required to have high heat resistance, such as a structural material, a food container material, a food wrapping material or an electric or electronic part material, particularly as an electric or electronic part material, because it is excellent in soldering resistance.</p><p>2. Parts with a crystallinity of at least 20% may be obtained by subjecting cyclopentene polymers having an end of melting point between 240 and 200 120 conditions are a temperature of 150 to 280 of 20 seconds to 90 minutes, preferably to give a cyclopentene polymer which has a heat deformation temperature of from 200 to 260 These parts have good physical properties such as heat resistance and chemical resistance, and thus are useful for, for example, general construction materials, electric or electronic devices, and car parts.</p><p>3. Cyclopentene resins may be nucleated to promote crystallization during processing. An example would be a polycyclopentene resin composition containing as main components (A) 100 parts by weight of a polycyclopentene and (B) 0.01 to 25 parts by weight of one or more nucleating agents selected from the group consisting of (1) metal salts of organic acids, (2) inorganic compounds, (3) organophosphorus compounds, and/or (4) metal salts of ionic hydrocarbon copolymer. Suitable nucleating agents may be sodium methylenebis(2,4-di-tertbutylphenyl) acid phosphate, sodium bis(4-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate, aluminum p-(tert-butyl) benzoate, talc, mica, or related species. These could be used in a process for producing polycyclopentene resin moldings by molding the above polycyclopentene resin composition at a temperature above their melting point.</p><p>4. Flame retardants and flame retardant combinations may be added to a cyclopentene polymer. Suitable flame retardants include a halogen-based or phosphorus-based flame retardant, antimony trioxide, antimony pentoxide, sodium antimonate, metallic antimony, antimony trichloride, antimony pentachloride, antimony trisulfide, antimony pentasulfide, zinc borate, barium metaborate or zirconium oxide. They may be used in conventional amounts.</p><p>5. Antioxidants may be used in conventional amounts to improve the stability of the cyclopentene polymers. For instance 0.005 to 30 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the cyclopentene polymer, of an antioxidant selected from the group consisting of a phosphorous containing antioxidant, a phenolic antioxidant or a combination thereof. The phosphorous containing antioxidant may be a monophosphite or diphosphite or mixture thereof and the phenolic antioxidant may be a dialkyl phenol, trialkyl phenol, diphenylmonoalkoxylphenol, a tetraalkyl phenol, or a mixture thereof. A sulfur-containing antioxidant may also be used alone or in combination with other antioxidants.</p><p>6. Various fillers or reinforcers, such as particulate or fibrous materials, may be added to improve various physical properties.</p><p>7. "Special" physical properties can be obtained by the use of specific types of materials. Electrically conductive materials such as fine metallic wires or graphite may be used to render the polymer electrically conductive. The temperature coefficient of expansion may be regulated by the use of appropriate fillers, and it may be possible to even obtain materials with positive coefficients of expansion. Such materials are particularly useful in electrical and electronic parts.</p><p>8. The polymer may be crosslinked by irradiation or chemically as by using peroxides, optionally in the presence of suitable coagents. Suitable peroxides include benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butylperoxybenzoate, tert-butylcumyl peroxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy) hexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy) hexyne-3,1,1-bis(tert-=butylperoxyisopropyl) benzene, 1,1-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, n-butyl-4,4-bis (tert-butylperoxy)valerate, 2,2-bis(tert-butylperoxy) butane and tert-butylperoxybenzene.</p><p>When polymerizing cyclopentene, it has been found that some of the impurities that may be found in cyclopentene poison or otherwise interfere with the polymerizations described herein. Compounds such as 1,3-pentadiene (which can be removed by passage through 5A molecular sieves), cyclopentadiene (which can be removed by distillation from Na), and methylenecyclobutane (which can be removed by distillation from polyphosphoric acid), may interfere with the polymerization, and their level should be kept as low as practically possible.</p><p>The above polymers (in general) are useful in many applications. Crystalline high molecular weight polymers are useful as molding resins, and for films for use in packaging. Amorphous resins are useful as elastomers, and may be crosslinked by known methods, such as by using free radicals. When such amorphous resins contain repeat units derived from polar monomers they are oil resistant. Lower molecular weight polymers are useful as oils, such as in polymer processing aids. When they contain polar groups, particularly carboxyl groups, they are useful in adhesives.</p><p>In many of the above polymerizations, the transition metal compounds employed as (part of the) catalysts contain(s) (a) metal atom(s) in a positive oxidation state. In addition, these complexes may have a square planar configuration about the metal, and the metal, particularly nickel or palladium, may have a d.sup.8 electronic configuration. Thus some of these catalysts may be said to have a metal atom which is cationic and has a d.sup.8 -square planar configuration.</p><p>In addition these catalysts may have a bidentate ligand wherein coordination to the transition metal is through two different nitrogen atoms or through a nitrogen atom and a phosphorus atom, these nitrogen and phosphorus atoms being part of the bidentate ligand. It is believed that some of these compounds herein are effective polymerization catalysts at least partly because the bidentate ligands have sufficient steric bulk on both sides of the coordination plane (of the square planar complex). Some of the Examples herein with the various catalysts of this type illustrate the degree of steric bulk which may be needed for such catalysts. If such a complex contains a bidentate ligand which has the appropriate steric bulk, it is believed that it produces polyethylene with a degree of polymerization of at least about 10 or more.</p><p>It is also believed that the polymerization catalysts herein are effective because unpolymerized olefinic monomer can only slowly displace from the complex a coordinated olefin which may be formed by β-hydride elimination from the growing polymer chain which is attached to the transition metal. The displacement can occur by associative exchange. Increasing the steric bulk of the ligand slows the rate of associative exchange and allows polymer chain growth. A quantitative measure of the steric bulk of the bidentate ligand can be obtained by measuring at 85 ethylene in a complex of formula (XI) as shown in equation 1 using standard .sup.1 H NMR techniques, which is called herein the Ethylene Exchange Rate (EER). The neutral bidentate ligand is represented by YN where Y is either N or P. The EER is measured in this system. In this measurement system the metal is always Pd, the results being applicable to other metals as noted below. Herein it is preferred for catalysts to contain bidentate ligands for which the second order rate constant for Ethylene Exchange Rate is about 20,000 L-mol.sup.-1 s.sup.-1 or less when the metal used in the polymerization catalyst is palladium, more preferably about 10,000 L-mol.sup.-1 s.sup.-1 or less, and more preferably about 5,000 L-mol.sup.-1 s.sup.-1 or less. When the metal in the polymerization catalyst is nickel, the second order rate constant (for the ligand in EER measurement) is about 50,000 L-mol.sup.-1 s.sup.-1, more preferably about 25,000 L-mol.sup.-1 s.sup.-1 or less, and especially preferably about 10,000 L-mol.sup.-1 s.sup.-1 or less. Herein the EER is measured using the compound (XI) in a procedure (including temperature) described in Examples 21-23. ##STR80## In these polymerizations it is preferred if the bidentate ligand is an α-diimine. It is also preferred if the olefin has the formula R.sup.17 CH═CH.sub.2, wherein R.sup.17 is hydrogen or n-alkyl.</p><p>In general for the polymers described herein, blends may be prepared with other polymers, and such other polymers may be elastomers, thermoplastics or thermosets. By elastomers are generally meant polymers whose Tg (glass transition temperature) and Tm (melting point), if present, are below ambient temperature, usually considered to be about 20 Thermoplastics are those polymers whose Tg and/or Tm are at or above ambient temperature. Blends can be made by any of the common techniques known to the artisan, such as solution blending, or melt blending in a suitable apparatus such as a single or twin-screw extruder. Specific uses for the polymers of this application in the blends or as blends are listed below.</p><p>Blends may be made with almost any kind of elastomer, such as EP, EPDM, SBR, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, neoprene, butyl rubber, styrene-butadiene block copolymers, segmented polyester-polyether copolymers, elastomeric polyurethanes, chlorinated or chlorosulfonated polyethylene (per)fluorinated elastomers such as copolymers of vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene and optionally tetrafluoroethylene, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoro(methyl vinyl ether), and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene.</p><p>Suitable thermoplastics which are useful for blending with the polymers described herein include: polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(butylene terephthalate), and poly(ethylene adipate); polyamides such as nylon-6, nylon-6,6, nylon-12, nylon-12,12, nylon-11, and a copolymer of hexamethylene diamine, adipic acid and terephthalic acid; fluorinated polymers such as copolymers of ethylene and vinylidene fluoride, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and a perfluoro(alkyl vinyl ether) such as perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether), and poly(vinyl fluoride); other halogenated polymers such a poly(vinyl chloride) and poly(vinylidene chloride) and its copolymers; polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene, and copolymers thereof; (meth)acrylic polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and copolymers thereof; copolymers of olefins such as ethylene with various (meth) acrylic monomers such as alkyl acrylates, (meth)acrylic acid and ionomers thereof, and glycidyl (meth)acrylate); aromatic polyesters such as the copolymer of Bisphenol A and terephthalic and/or isophthalic acid; and liquid crystalline polymers such as aromatic polyesters or aromatic poly(ester-amides).</p><p>Suitable thermosets for blending with the polymers described herein include epoxy resins, phenol-formaldehyde resins, melamine resins, and unsaturated polyester resins (sometimes called thermoset polyesters). Blending with thermoset polymers will often be done before the thermoset is crosslinked, using standard techniques.</p><p>The polymers described herein may also be blended with uncrosslinked polymers which are not usually considered thermoplastics for various reasons, for instance their viscosity is too high and/or their melting point is so high the polymer decomposes below the melting temperature. Such polymers include poly(tetrafluoroethylene), aramids such as poly(p-phenylene terephthalate) and poly(m-phenylene isophthalate), liquid crystalline polymer such as poly(benzoxazoles), and non-melt processible polyimides which are often aromatic polyimides.</p><p>All of the polymers disclosed herein may be mixed with various additives normally added to elastomers and thermoplastics [see EPSE (below), vol. 14, p. 327-410]. For instance reinforcing, non-reinforcing and conductive fillers, such as carbon black, glass fiber, minerals such as clay, mica and talc, glass spheres, barium sulfate, zinc oxide, carbon fiber, and aramide fiber or fibrids, may be used. Antioxidants, antiozonants, pigments, dyes, delusterants, compounds to promote crosslinking may be added. Plasticizers such as various hydrocarbon oils may also be used.</p><p>The following listing is of some uses for polyolefins, which are made from linear olefins and do not include polar monomers such as acrylates, which are disclosed herein.

The polymers may be characterized as having: a) a melt flow ration, I10/I2,≧5.63, b) a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, defined by the equation; Mw/Mn≦(I10/I2)-4.63, and c) a critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture of at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture of a linear olefin polymer having about the same I2 and Mw/Mn.

The randomly-branched olefin polymers preferably have a molecular weight distribution from about 1.5 to about 2.5. The polymers described herein often have improved processability over conventional olefin polymers and are useful in producing fabricated articles such as fibers, films, and molded parts. For this paragraph, the value I2 is measured in accordance with ASTM D-1238-190/2.16 and I10 is measured in accordance with ASTM D-1238-190/10; critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture and processing index (PI) are defined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,272, which is hereby included by reference.</p><p>In another process described herein, the product of the process described herein is an α-olefin. It is preferred that in the process a linear α-olefin is produced. It is also preferred that the α-olefin contain 4 to 32, preferably 8 to 20, carbon atoms. ##STR81##</p><p>When (XXXI) is used as a catalyst, a neutral Lewis acid or a cationic Lewis or Bronsted acid whose counterion is a weakly coordinating anion is also present as part of the catalyst system (sometimes called a "first compound" in the claims). By a "neutral Lewis acid" is meant a compound which is a Lewis acid capable for abstracting X.sup.-  from (I) to form a weakly coordinating anion. The neutral Lewis acid is originally uncharged (i.e., not ionic). Suitable neutral Lewis acids include SbF.sub.5, Ar.sub.3 B (wherein Ar is aryl), and BF.sub.3. By a cationic Lewis acid is meant a cation with a positive charge such as Ag.sup.+, H.sup.+, and Na.sup.+.</p><p>A preferred neutral Lewis acid is an alkyl aluminum compound, such as R.sup.9.sub.3 Al, R.sup.9.sub.2 AlCl, R.sup.9 AlCl.sub.2, and "R.sup.9 AlO" (alkylaluminoxane), wherein R.sup.9 is alkyl containing 1 and 25 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Suitable alkyl aluminum compounds include methylaluminoxane, (C.sub.2 H.sub.5).sub.2 AlCl, C.sub.2 H.sub.5 AlCl.sub.2, and [(CH.sub.3).sub.2 CHCH.sub.2 ].sub.3 Al.</p><p>Relatively noncoordinating anions are known in the art, and the coordinating ability of such anions is known and has been discussed in the literature, see for instance W. Beck., et al., Chem. Rev., vol. 88 p. 1405-1421 (1988), and S. H. Strauss, Chem. Rev., vol. 93, p. 927-942 (1993), both of which are hereby included by reference. Among such anions are those formed from the aluminum compounds in the immediately preceding paragraph and X.sup.-, including R.sup.9.sub.3 AlX.sup.-, R.sup.9.sub.2 AlClX.sup.-, R.sup.9 AlCl.sub.2 X.sup.-, and "R.sup.9 AlOX.sup.- ". Other useful noncoordinating anions include BAF.sup.-  {BAF=tetrakis [3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate}, SbF.sub.6.sup.-, PF.sub.6.sup.-, and BF.sub.4 .sup.-, trifluoromethanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, (R.sub.f SO.sub.2).sub.2 N.sup.-, and (C.sub.6 F.sub.5).sub.4 B.sup.-,</p><p>The temperature at which the process is carried out is about -100 C. to about -200 150 C. It is believed that at higher temperatures, lower molecular weight α-olefins are produced, all other factors being equal. The pressure at which the polymerization is carried out is not critical, atmospheric pressure to about 275 MPa being a suitable range. It is also believed that increasing the pressure increases the relative amount of α-olefin (as opposed to internal olefin) produced.</p><p>The process to make α-olefins may be run in a solvent (liquid), and that is preferred. The solvent may in fact be the α-olefin produced. Such a process may be started by using a deliberately added solvent which is gradually displaced as the reaction proceeds. By solvent it is not necessarily meant that any or all of the starting materials and/or products are soluble in the (liquid) solvent.</p><p>In (I) it is preferred that R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 are both hydrogen or methyl or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4 taken together are ##STR82## It is also preferred that each of Q and S is independently chlorine or bromine, and it is more preferred that both of Q and S in (XXXI) are chlorine or bromine.</p><p>In (XXXI) R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl. What these groups are greatly determines whether the α-olefins of this process are made, or whether high polymeric materials, i.e., materials containing over 25 ethylene units, are coproduced or produced almost exclusively. If R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are highly sterically hindered about the nickel atom, the tendency is to produce higher polmeric material. For instance, when R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are both 2,6-diisopropylphenyl mostly higher polymeric material is produced. However, when R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are both phenyl, mostly the α-olefins of this process are produced. Of course this will also be influenced by other reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, as noted above. Useful groups for R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are phenyl, and p-methylphenyl.</p><p>As is understood by the artisan, in oligomerization reactions of ethylene to produce α-olefins, usually a mixture of such α-olefins is obtained containing a series of such α-olefins differing from one another by two carbon atoms (an ethylene unit). The process for preparing α-olefins described herein produces products with a high percentage of terminal olefinic groups (as opposed to internal olefinic groups). The product mixture also contains a relatively high percentage of molecules which are linear. Finally relatively high catalyst efficiencies can be obtained.</p><p>The α-olefins described as being made herein may also be made by contacting ethylene with one of the compounds ##STR83## wherein R.sup.2, R.sup.3, R.sup.4, and R.sup.5 are as defined (and preferred) as described above (for the preparation of α-olefins), and T.sup.1 is hydrogen or n-alkyl containing up to 38 carbon atoms, Z is a neutral Lewis base wherein the donating atom is nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen, provided that if the donating atom is nitrogen then the pKa of the conjugate acid of that compound (measured in water) is less than about 6, U is n-alkyl containing up to 38 carbon atoms, and X is a noncoordinating anion (see above). The process conditions for making α-olefins using (III) or (XXXIV) are the same as for using (XXXI) to make these compounds except a Lewis or Bronsted acid need not be present. Note that the double line in (XXXIV) represents a coordinated ethylene molecule. (XXXIV) may be made from (II) by reaction of (III) with ethylene. In other words, (XXXIV) may be considered an active intermediate in the formation of α-olefin from (III). Suitable groups for Z include dialkyl ethers such as diethyl ether, and alkyl nitriles such as acetonitrile.</p><p>In general, α-olefins can be made by this process using as a catalyst a Ni[II] complex of an α-diimine of formula (VIII), wherein the Ni[II] complex is made by any of the methods which are described above, using Ni[0], Ni[I] or Ni[II] precursors. All of the process conditions, and preferred groups on (VIII), are the same as described above in the process for making α-olefins.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>In the Examples, the following convention is used for naming α-diimine complexes of metals, and the α-diimine itself. The α-diimine is indicated by the letters "DAB". To the left of the "DAB" are the two groups attached to the nitrogen atoms, herein usually called R.sup.2 and R.sup.5. To the right of the "DAB" are the groups on the two carbon atoms of the α-diimine group, herein usually termed R.sup.3 and R.sup.4. To the right of all this appears the metal, ligands attached to the metal (such as Q, S and T), and finally any anions (X), which when "free" anions are designated by a superscript minus sign (i.e., X.sup.-). Of course if there is a "free" anion present, the metal containing moiety is cationic. Abbreviations for these groups are as described in the Specification in the Note after Table 1.

Samples were preheated for at least 15 min before acquiring data. Data acquisition time was typically 12 hr. per sample. The T.sup.1 values of the carbons were measured under these conditions to be all less than 0.9 s. The longest T.sup.1 measured was for the Bu.sup.-, end of chain resonance at 14 ppm, which was 0.84 s. Occasionally about 16 vol. % benzene-d.sub.6 was added to the TCB and the sample was run locked. Some samples were run in chloroform-d1, CDCl.sub.3 -d1, (locked) at 30 acquisition parameters. T.sup.1 's were also measured in CDCl.sub.3 at ambient temperature on a typical sample with 0.05 M Cr(acetylacetonate).sub.3 to be all less than 0.68 s. In rare cases when Cr(acetylacetonate).sub.3 was not used, a 30-40 s recycle delay was used to insure quantitation. The glycidyl arcylate copolymer was run at 100 the solvent--either the TCB highfield resonance at 127.8 ppm or the chloroform-d1 triplet at 77 ppm. A DEPT 135 spectrum was done on most samples to distinguish methyls and methines from methylenes. Methyls were distinguished from methines by chemical shift. EOC is end-of-chain. Assignments reference to following naming scheme:</p><p>1. xBy: By is a branch of length y carbons; x is the carbon being discussed, the methyl at the end of the branch is numbered 1. Thus the second carbon from the end of a butyl is 2B4. Branches of length y or greater are designated as y.sup.+.</p><p>2. xEBy: EB is a ester ended branch containing y methylenes. x is the carbon being discussed, the first methylene adjacent to the ester carbonyl is labeled 1. Thus the second methylene from the end of a 5 methylene ester terminated branch would be 2EB5. .sup.13 C NMR of model compounds for EBy type branches for y=0 and y=5.sup.+  confirm the peak positions and assignments of these branches. In addition, a model compound for an EB1 branch is consistent with 2 dimensional NMR data using the well know 2D NMR techniques of hsqc, hmbc, and hsqc-tocsy; the 2D data confirms the presence of the EB5.sup.+, EB0, EB1 and other intermediate length EB branches.</p><p>3. The methylenes in the backbone are denoted with Greek letters which determine how far from a branch point methine each methylene is. Thus ββ (beta beta) B denotes the central methylene in the following PCHRCH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CHRP. Methylenes that are three or more carbons from a branch point are designated as γ.sup.+  (gamma.sup.+).</p><p>4. When x in xBy or xEBy is replaced by a M, the methine carbon of that branch is denoted.</p><p>Integrals of unique carbons in each branch were measured and were reported as number of branches per 1000 methylenes (including methylenes in the backbone and branches). These integrals are accurate to +/- 5% relative for abundant branches and +/- 10 or 20% relative for branches present at less than 10 per 1000 methylenes.</p><p>Such types of analyses are generally known, see for instance "A Quantitative Analysis of Low Density (Branched) Polyethylenes by Carbon -13 Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance at 67.9 MHz", D. E. Axelson, et al., Marcomolecules 12 (1979) pp. 41-52; "Fine Branching Structure in High-Pressure, Low Density Polyethylenes by 50.10-MHz 13C NMR Analysis", T. Usami et al., Macromolecules 17 (1984) pp. 1757-1761; and "Quantification of Branching in Polyethylene by 13C NMR Using paramagnetic Relaxation Agents", J. V. Prasad, et al., Eur. Polym. J. 27 (1991) pp. 251-254 (Note that this latter paper is believed to have some significant typographical errors in it).</p><p>It is believed that in many of the polymers described herein which have unusual branching, i.e., they have more or fewer branches than would be expected for "normal" coordination polymerizations, or the distribution of sizes of the branches is different from that expected, that "branches on branches" are also present. By this is meant that a branch from the main chain on the polymer may itself contain one or more branches. It is also noted that the concept of a "main chain" may be a somewhat semantic argument if there are sufficient branches on branches in any particular polymer.</p><p>By a polymer hydrocarbyl branch is meant a methyl group to a methine or quaternary carbon atom or a group of consecutive methylenes terminated at one end by a methyl group and connected at the other end to a methine or quaternary carbon atom. The length of the branch is defined as the number of carbons from and including the methyl group to the nearest methine or quaternary carbon atom, but not including the methine or quaternary carbon atom. If the number of consecutive methylene groups is "n" then the branch contains (or the branch length is) n+1. Thus the structure (which represents part of a polymer) --CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH[CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 CH.sub.3 ]CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 -- contains 2 branches, a methyl and an ethyl branch.</p><p>For ester ended branches a similar definition is used. An ester branch refers to a group of consecutive methylene groups terminated at one end by an ester --COOR group, and connected at the other end to a methine or quaternary carbon atom. The length of the branch is defined as the number of consecutive methylene groups form the ester group to the nearest methine or quaternary carbon atom, but not including the methine or quaternary carbon atom. If the number of methylene groups is "n", then the length of the branch is n. Thus --CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH[CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH(CH.sub.3)CH.sub.2 COOR]CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 -- contains 2 branches, a methyl and an n=1 ester branch.</p><p>The .sup.13 C NMR peaks for copolymers of cyclopentene and ehtylene are described based on the labeling scheme and assignments of A. Jerscow et al. Macromolecules 1995, 28, 7095-7099. The triads and pentads are described as 1-cme, 1,3-ccmcc, 1,3-cmc, 2-cme, 2-cmc, 1,3-eme, 3-cme, and 4,5-cmc, where e=ethylene, c=cyclopentene, and m=meta cyclopentene (i.e. 1,3 enchainment).

The outputs of the two detectors were very similar. Since the UV detector is only sensitive to the ester functionality, and the RI detector is a relatively nonselective mass detector, the matching of the two detector outputs shows that the ester functionality of the methyl acrylate is distributed throughout the entire molecular weight range of the polymer, consistent with a true copolymer of methyl acrylate and ethylene.</p><p>A 0.503 g sample of the copolymer was fractionated by dissolving in benzene and precipitating partially by slow addition of MeOH. This type of fractionation experiment is a particularly sensitive method for detecting a low molecular weight methyl acrylate rich component since it should be the most soluble material under the precipitation conditions.</p><p>The precipitate 0.349 g, (69%) contained 6.9 mole % methyl acrylate by .sup.1 H NMR integration, GPC (THF, PMMA standard, RI detector): M.sub.n =19,600, M.sub.w =29,500, M.sub.w /M.sub.n =1.51.

After 14.25 min at -80 80% of the ether adduct had been converted to the olefin complex. Two sets of bound olefin resonances were observed in a 86:14 ratio. This observation is consistent with the existence of two different rotamers of the olefin complex. Insertion of MA into the Pd-Me bond occurred with predominantly 2,1 regiochemistry to give the 4-membered chelate 4a(Me) at -80iC (t.sub.1/2 ˜2.0 h). The resonances for the major rotamer of the olefin complex disappeared before those of the minor rotamer.

(For copolymerizations with FOA, a second precipitation of the polymer solution into methanol was often necessary in order to remove all of the acrylate from the polymer.) The solution was filtered though a plug of Celite alumina, the solvent was removed, and the polymer was dried in vacuo for several days. The copolymers were isolated as clear, free-flowing or viscous oils. The copolymers were often darkened by traces of palladium black, which proved difficult to remove in some cases. Polymers with high FOA incorporation were white, presumably due to phase separation of the fluorinated and hydrocarbon segments.</p><p>(b) Experiments at Elevated Pressure: Reactions were carried out in a mechanically stirred 300 mL Parr heating mantle controlled by a thermocouple dipping into the reaction mixture. A solution of 0.1 mmol of catalyst precursor in methylene chloride, containing the functionalized comonomer (5-50 mL, total volume of the liquid phase: 100 mL), was transferred via cannula to the reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere. After repeatedly flushing with ethylene or propylene, constant pressure was applied by continuously feeding the gaseous olefin and the contents of the reactor were vigorously stirred. After the specified reaction time, the gas was vented. Volatiles were removed from the reaction mixture in vacuo, and the polymer was dried under vacuum overnight. In representative runs, the volatile fraction was analyzed by GC for low-molecular-weight products. Residual monomers (tBuA, FOA) or homooligomers of the functionalized comonomer (MVK) were removed by precipitating the polymer from methylene chloride solution with methanol. This procedure did not significantly alter the polymer composition.</p><p>Copolymer Spectral Data. In addition to the signals of the methyl, methylene and methine groups originating from ethylene or propylene, the .sup.1 H and .sup.13 C NMR spectra of the copolymers exhibit characteristic resonances due to the functionalized comonomer.
