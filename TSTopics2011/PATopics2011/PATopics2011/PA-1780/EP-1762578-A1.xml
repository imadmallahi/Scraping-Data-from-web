These comprise the reaction product of a base polyol, a preformed stabilizer and at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, in the presence of a free-radical polymerization initiator and at least one polymer control agent.</p><p num="p0002">Polymer polyol compositions are commercial products that have found use in a variety of applications primarily as constituents in the production of polyurethanes. Polyurethanes are suitable for the production of coatings, adhesives, sealants, elastomers, and flexible, semi-flexible and rigid foams. The primary function of polymer polyols is to enhance the hardness or stiffness of the polyurethane and, in particular, to enhance the load bearing or energy adsorbing capacity of polyurethane foams. End- use applications of polyurethane foams include, for example, mattresses, furniture, carpet pad; packaging and energy management, thermal insulation, and automotive seating, trim, headliners, sound insulation, crash pads, etc.</p><p num="p0003">The basic patents relating to such polymer polyol compositions are Stamberger, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="USRE28715E" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent Re. 28,715</text></patcit> (reissue of <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US3383351A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 3,383,351</text></patcit>) and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="USRE29118E" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent Re. 29,118</text></patcit> (reissue of <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US3304273A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 3,304,273</text></patcit>). As described therein, a stable dispersion of polymer particles in a polyol can be produced by polymerizing one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomer dissolved or dispersed in a polyol in the presence of a free<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> radical catalyst.</p><p num="p0004">Initially, the primary polymer polyol compositions accepted commercially used acrylonitrile in its manufacture. Many of these compositions possessed undesirably high viscosities for certain applications. More recently, acrylonitrile-styrene monomer mixtures have been used commercially to make the polymer component of polymer polyols. The expanding demand for polymer polyols has highlighted several product needs and this has spawned additional advances in technology.</p><p num="p0005">Polymer polyols derived from such high styrene monomer mixtures appear incapable of satisfying ever-increasing market needs, which include rigorous stability, filterability and low-viscosity requirements, and increased load-bearing characteristics in polyurethane foams. It is known that polyurethane foams with increased load-bearing characteristics can be obtained by increasing the polymer or solid contents and/or by increasing the functionality and hydroxyl number of the polyol. Thus, polymer polyols having high solids contents, i.e. 30 to 60 weight percent or higher, are desirable. However, an increase in the solids contents of polymer polyols is, generally, at the expense of the other properties (i.e. filterability, stability and viscosity) of the polymer polyol. It is desirable that polymer polyols have high solids contents, with relatively low viscosities, and good filterability.</p><p num="p0006">Employment of high styrene monomer mixtures and high solid content polymer polyols, by prior practices, generally resulted in undesirably high viscosity polymer polyols. The viscosity of a polymer polyol should be sufficiently low for ease of handling during its manufacture. In addition, the viscosity should facilitate transport, handling and, ultimately, adequate processability, in the employed foam processing equipment. Because of increased use of sophisticated mixing systems, such as impingement systems, excessive viscosity of the polymer polyol is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> becoming a significant problem. The need for lower viscosity polymer polyols is apparent to satisfy these increased demands in the art.</p><p num="p0007">As indicated, polymer polyol stability is a concern to makers of polyurethanes. At one time, seediness or filterability, a measure of stability of polymer polyols, was not a major issue in commercial practices. However, advances in the state of the art of polyurethane production such as high pressure carbon dioxide injection have resulted in revisions in polymer polyol stability and filterability criteria.</p><p num="p0008">With commercial developments in sophisticated, high-speed and large-volume equipment and systems for handling, mixing and reacting polyurethane-forming ingredients have evolved the need for highly stable and low viscosity polymer polyols. Polymer polyols have certain minimum requirements for satisfactory processing in such sophisticated foam equipment. Typically, the prime requirement is that the polymer polyols possess sufficiently small particles so that filters, pumps and the like do not become plugged or fouled in relatively short periods of time.</p><p num="p0009">Though there have been advances in reduction in viscosity and increase in solids of polymer polyols, there remains a need for improvement in viscosity reduction and increase in solids content. Greater reductions in viscosity are needed to meet market demands and greater effective increases in solids content are also needed by the market. More importantly, there is a need for technology in polymer polyols that maximizes viscosity reduction while also providing a viable mechanism to higher solids content.</p><p num="p0010"><patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4522976A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 4,522,976</text></patcit> discloses polymer polyol dispersions in a mixture of low molecular weight polyols and polyether polyols, and the suitability of these dispersions for preparing foams. These polymer polyols are prepared by polymerizing 25 to 70% by weight of one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers in a polyol mixture comprising (1) 25 to 99% by wt. of a polyol containing from 2 to 8 hydroxyl groups and<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> having an equivalent weight of 30 to 200, and (2) from 1 to 75% by wt. of a macromer containing induced unsaturation.</p><p num="p0011">Polymer polyols dispersions and a process for their production are also disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4690956A" status="new"><text>U.S. 4,690,956</text></patcit>. These polymer polyol dispersions are prepared by free-radical polymerization of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or monomers in the presence of a reaction moderator in a polyol mixture of polyether polyol and a macromer which contains induced unsaturation. The reaction moderator has a fumarate containing polyetherester polyol as the unsaturation moiety, and at least 50% of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer is acrylonitrile.</p><p num="p0012">Surprisingly, it has now been found that the good stability and filterability of a polymer polyol can be achieved at a very high solids level in a base polyol having a high hydroxyl number. In accordance with the present invention, the combination of high hydroxyl number/low molecular weight base polyols with a preformed stabilizer in a polymer polyol result in the final product having a significantly lower viscosity.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="p0013">This invention relates to low viscosity polymer polyols which are characterized by high hydroxyl numbers, and to a process for the preparation of these low viscosity polymer polyols which have high hydroxyl numbers.</p><p num="p0014">The low viscosity polymer polyols of the present invention are characterized by an OH number ≥20, viscosities that are less than or equal to: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math overflow="scroll" display="block"><msup><mi>be</mi><mfenced open="[" separators="" close="]"><mn mathvariant="normal">2.7</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mfenced></msup></math><img id="ib0001" orientation="unknown" wi="23" img-format="tif" img-content="math" file="imgb0001.tif" inline="no" he="8"/></maths>

Examples of suitable free-radical polymerization initiators for the present invention include initiators such as; for example, peroxides including both alkyl and aryl hydroperoxides, persulfates, perborates, percarbonates, azo compounds, etc. Some specific examples include catalysts such as hydrogen peroxide, di(t-butyl)-peroxide, t-butylperoxy diethyl acetate, t-butyl peroctoate, t-butyl peroxy isobutyrate, t-butyl peroxy 3,5,5-trimethyl hexanoate, t-butyl perbenzoate, t-butyl peroxy pivalate, t-amyl peroxy pivalate, t-butyl peroxy-2-ethyl hexanoate, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, azobis(isobutyronitrile), 2,2'-azo bis-(2-methylbutyronitrile), etc.</p><p num="p0062">Useful initiators also include, for example, those catalysts having a satisfactory half-life within the temperature ranges used in forming the polymer polyol. Typically, the half-life of the catalyst should be about 25% or less of the residence time in the reactor at any given time. Preferred initiators for this portion of the invention include acyl peroxides such as didecanoyl peroxide and dilauroyl peroxide, alkyl peroxides such as t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, t-butylperpivalate, t-amyl peroxy pivalate, t-amyl peroctoate, 2,5-dimethyl-hexane-2,5-di-per-2-ethyl hexoate, t-butyl perneodecanoate, t-butylper-benzoate and 1,1-dimethyl-3-hydroxybutyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, and azo catalysts such as azobis(isobutyronitrile),<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> 2,2'-azo bis-(2-methoxyl-butyronitrile), and mixtures thereof. Most preferred are the acyl peroxides described above and the azo catalysts. A particularly preferred initiator comprises azobis(isobutyronitrile).</p><p num="p0063">Particularly preferred in the practice of the invention, are the use of azo catalysts and the aforementioned acyl peroxides of the above formula. The preferred acyl peroxides include those which have the unique advantage of effecting the desired degree of polymerization essentially without raising the viscosity of the polymer polyol over that obtained with the azo catalyst. This enhances one's ability to achieve higher solids polymer polyols with good product stability without raising product viscosity. Such acyl peroxides can be used in molar amounts substantially less than the amounts required when using other free radical catalysts in forming the polymer polyols.</p><p num="p0064">The quantity of free-radical initiator used herein is not critical and can be varied within wide limits. In general, the amount of initiator ranges from about 0.01 to 2% by weight, based on 100% by weight of the final polymer polyol. Increases in catalyst concentration result in increases in monomer conversion up to a certain point, but past this, further increases do not result in substantial increases in conversion. The particular catalyst concentration selected will usually be an optimum value, taking all factors into consideration including costs.</p><p num="p0065">Suitable polymer control agents for use as component (E) in the present invention include, for example, those known to be useful in polymer polyols and the processes of preparing polyols such as those described in, for example, <patcit id="pcit0019" dnum="US3953393A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patents 3,953,393</text></patcit>,<patcit id="pcit0020" dnum="US4119586A" status="new"><text> 4,119,586</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0021" dnum="US4463107A" status="new"><text>4,463,107</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0022" dnum="US5324774A" status="new"><text>5,324,774</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0023" dnum="US5814699A" status="new"><text>5,814,699</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0024" dnum="US6624209B" status="new"><text>6,624,209</text></patcit>, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Some examples of suitable compounds to be used as polymer control agents include various mono-ols (i.e. monohydroxy alcohols), aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and other liquids.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p num="p0066">Polymer control agents are also commonly referred to as reaction moderators. These are known to control the molecular weight of the polymer polyol. As long as the compound used as the polymer control agent does not adversely affect the performance of the polymer polyol, it is suitable for use in the practice of the invention. Preferred are the mono-ols because of their ease of stripping from the final polymer/polyol composition. Mixtures of one or more mono-ols may be used as polymer control agents. The choice of mono-ol is not narrowly critical. It should not form two phases at reaction conditions and should be readily stripped from the final polymer/polyol.</p><p num="p0067">Suitable polymer control agents include, for example, one or more mono-ol which is typically an alcohol containing at least one carbon atom, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, sec.-butanol, t-butanol, n-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, allyl alcohol, and the like, and mixtures of the same. The preferred mono-ol is isopropanol. Other known polymer control agents include compounds such as, for example, ethylbenzene and toluene. In accordance with the present invention, the most preferred polymer control agents include isopropanol, ethanol, tert-butanol, toluene, ethylbenzene, etc.</p><p num="p0068">The quantity of total polymer control agent to be employed in the present invention is greater than about 5.0% by weight, preferably at least about 5.2%, more preferably at least about 5.5% and most preferably at least about 6.0% by weight, based on the 100% by weight of all components which comprise the polymer polyol, prior to stripping the product, (i.e. components (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E)). The quantity of total polymer control agent is also employed in amounts of less than or equal to 20% by weight, preferably less than or equal to about 18%, more preferably less than or equal to 16% and most preferably less than or equal to about 15% by weight, based on the total weight of all components charged to the reactor. The amount of total polymer control agent may be<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> employed in any amount ranging between any combination of these lower and upper values, inclusive, e.g., from greater than about 5.0% to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 5.2% to about 18% by weight, more preferably from about 5.5% to about 16% by weight and most preferably from about 6.0% to about 15% by weight, based on 100% by weight of total polymer control agent.</p><p num="p0069">In addition, the polymer polyol and the process of preparing the polymer polyol may optionally comprise a chain transfer agent. The use of chain transfer agents and their nature is known in the art. Examples of suitable materials include compounds such as mercaptans including, e.g. dodecane thiol, ethane thiol, octane thiol, toluene thiol, etc., halogenated hydrocarbons such as, e.g. carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide, chloroform, etc., amines such as diethylamine, enol-ethers, etc. If used at all in the present invention, a chain transfer agent is preferably used in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 2 wt.%, more preferably from about 0.2 to about 1 wt.%, based on the total weight of the polymer polyol (prior to stripping).</p><p num="p0070">The polymer polyols from the present invention can be made using any process (including continuous and semi-batch) and reactor configuration that is known to be suitable to prepare polymer polyols, such as, for example, a two-stage reaction system comprising a continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) fitted with impeller(s) and baffles (first-stage) and a plug-flow reactor (second stage). A typical reaction system may be equipped with any combination of jacket/half-coil, internal coil/tubes or external loop/cooler to remove the heat of reaction. Furthermore, the reaction system can utilize a wide range of mixing conditions. The reaction system may be characterized by energy inputs of from 0.5 to 350 horsepower per 1000 gallons, with preferred mixing energies of from 2 to 50 horsepower per 1000 gallons on average for the bulk phase volume of each reactor a particularly useful mixing power input. Mixing can be<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> provided by any combination of impeller(s) and pump-around loop /jet mixing. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the optimum energy input will most likely vary with the dispersion stability and the molecular weight of the base polyether polyol, e.g., a greater amount of energy is preferred for products with higher viscosities. In addition, polymer polyols of the present invention can be prepared from various types and combinations of axially and/or radially / tangentially acting impellers including, but not limited to, 4-pitched-blade, 6-pitched-blade, 4-flat-blade, 6-flat-blade, pitched-blade turbine, flat-blade turbine, Rushton, Maxflow, propeller, etc. For a continuous production process to prepare polymer polyols including those described in the present invention, a residence time ranging from about 30 to about 180 minutes may be particularly useful.</p><p num="p0071">The reactants are pumped from feed tanks through an in-line static mixer, and then, through a feed tube into the reactor. It may be particularly useful to prepare a premix of the initiator with part of the polyol stream, as well as of polyol and stabilizer. Other process conditions, which may be useful, include cooling of the feed tube in the reactor. Furthermore, the suitable reaction conditions for polymer polyols in general as well as the specific products of the present invention mixture are characterized by a reaction temperature in the range of 100 to 150°C and a pressure in the range of 30 to 60 psig. Typically, the product can then treated in a single or multi staged stripping step to remove volatiles before entering a stage, which can essentially be any combination of filtration and/or product cooling. In the present case, the wt-% total polymer in the product was calculated from the concentrations of monomers measured in the crude polymer polyol before stripping.</p><p num="p0072">In accordance with the present invention, the polymer polyols are preferably produced by utilizing a low monomer to polyol ratio which is maintained throughout the reaction mixture during the process. This is<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> achieved by employing conditions that provide rapid conversion of monomer to polymer. In practice, a low monomer to polyol ratio is maintained, in the case of semi-batch and continuous operation, by control of the temperature and mixing conditions and, in the case of semibatch operation, also by slowly adding the monomers to the polyol.</p><p num="p0073">The temperature range is not critical and may vary from about 100°C to about 150° C or perhaps greater, preferably from about 100°C to about 140° C, with a more preferred range being from 115 °C to 125 °C. As has been noted herein, the catalyst and temperature should be selected such that the catalyst has a reasonable rate of decomposition with respect to the hold-up time in the reactor for a continuous flow reactor or the feed time for a semi-batch reactor.</p><p num="p0074">A suitable continuous process for making polymer polyols comprises (1) providing a heterogenous mixture of the preformed stabilizer and, optionally, liquid diluent, in combination with a polyol, a free radically polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and a free radical polymerization initiator, (2) in a reaction zone maintained at a temperature sufficient to initiate a free radical reaction, and under sufficient pressure to maintain only liquid phases in the reaction zone, for a period of time sufficient to react at least a major portion of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer to form a heterogenous mixture containing the enhanced polymer polyol, unreacted monomers and diluent, and stripping the unreacted monomers and diluent from the enhanced polymer polyol to recover the unreacted monomers and diluent. This continuous process allows the manufacture of high solids, white polymer polyols with lower viscosities and good stability. This product has excellent product stability and requires less free radical catalyst in the production process.
