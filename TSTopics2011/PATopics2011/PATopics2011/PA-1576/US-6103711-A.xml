The ICE inhibitors of this invention are characterized by specific structural and physicochemical features. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly well suited for inhibiting ICE activity and consequently, may be advantageously used as agents against interleukin-1 ("IL-1") mediated diseases, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. This invention also relates to methods for inhibiting ICE activity and methods for treating interleukin-1 mediated diseases using the compounds and compositions of this invention.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Interleukin 1 ("IL-1") is a major pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory protein that stimulates fibroblast differentiation and proliferation, the production of prostaglandins, collagenase and phospholipase by synovial cells and chondrocytes, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and neutrophil activation. Oppenheim, J. H. et al, Immunology Today, 7, pp. 45-56 (1986). As such, it is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. IL-1 is predominantly produced by peripheral blood monocytes as part of the inflammatory response and exists in two distinct agonist forms, IL-1Î± and IL-1Î². Mosely, B. S. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 84, pp. 4572-4576 (1987); Lonnemann, G. et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 19, pp. 1531-1536 (1989).</p> <p>IL-1Î² is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor, pIL-1Î². pIL-1Î² lacks a conventional leader sequence and is not processed by a signal peptidase. March, C. J., Nature, 315, pp. 641-647 (1985). Instead, pIL-1Î² is cleaved by interleukin-1Î² converting enzyme ("ICE") between Asp-116 and Ala-117 to produce the biologically active C-terminal fragment found in human serum and synovial fluid. Sleath, P. R., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, pp. 14526-14528 (1992); A. D. Howard et al., J. Immunol., 147, pp. 2964-2969 (1991). Processing by ICE is also necessary for the transport of mature IL-1Î² through the cell membrane.</p> <p>ICE is a cysteine protease localized primarily in monocytes. It converts precursor IL-1Î² to the mature form. Black, R. A. et al., FEBS Lett., 247, pp. 386-390 (1989); Kostura, M. J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86, pp. 5227-5231 (1989). ICE, or its homologues, also appears to be involved in the regulation of cell death or apoptosis. Yuan, J. et al., Cell, 75, pp. 641-652 (1993); Miura, M. et al., Cell, 75, pp. 653-660 (1993); Nett-Fiordalisi, M. A. et al., J. Cell Biochem., 17B, p. 117 (1993). In particular, ICE or ICE homologues are thought to be associated with the regulation of apoptosis in neurogenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Marx, J. and M. Baringa, Science, 259, pp. 760-762 (1993); Gagliardini, V. et al., Science, 263, pp. 826-828 (1994).</p> <p>ICE has been previously described as a heterodimer composed of two subunits, p20 and p10 (20 kDa and 10 kDa molecular weight, respectively). These subunits are derived from a 45 kDa proenzyme (p45) by way of a p30 form, through an activation mechanism that is autocatalytic. Thornberry, N. A. et al., Nature, 356, pp. 768-774 (1992). The ICE proenzyme has been divided into several functional domains: a prodomain (p14), a p22/20 subunit, a polypeptide linker and a p10 subunit. Thornberry et al., supra; Casano et al., Genomics, 20, pp. 474-481 (1994).</p><p>Full length p45 has been characterized by its cDNA and amino acid sequences. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577 and WO 94/00154. The p20 and p10 cDNA and amino acid sequences are also known. Thornberry et al., supra. Murine and rat ICE have also been sequenced and cloned. They have high amino acid and nucleic acid sequence homology to human ICE. Miller, D. K. et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 696, pp. 133-148 (1993); Molineaux, S. M. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 90, pp. 1809-1813 (1993). Knowledge of the primary structure of ICE, however, does not allow prediction of its tertiary structure. Nor does it afford an understanding of the structural, conformational and chemical interactions of ICE and its substrate pIL-1Î² or other substrates or inhibitors.</p><p>ICE inhibitors represent a class of compounds useful for the control of inflammation or apoptosis or both. Peptide and peptidyl inhibitors of ICE have been described. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577; WO 93/05071; WO 93/09135; WO 93/14777 and WO 93/16710; and European patent application 0 547 699. However, due to their peptidic nature, such inhibitors are typically characterized by undesirable pharmacologic properties, such as poor oral absorption, poor stability and rapid metabolism. Plattner, J. J. and D. W. Norbeck, in Drug Discovery Technologies, C. R. Clark and W. H. Moos, Eds. (Ellis Horwood, Chichester, England, 1990), pp. 92-126. This has hampered their development into effective drugs.</p><p>Accordingly, the need exists for compounds that can effectively inhibit the action of ICE, for use as agents for preventing and treating chronic and acute forms of IL-1 mediated diseases, including various cancers, as well as inflammatory, autoimmune or is neurodegenerative diseases.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention provides novel classes of compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, that are useful as inhibitors of ICE. These compounds can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, such as antibiotics, immunomodulators or other anti-inflammatory agents, for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases mediated by IL-1.

In the present invention, those hydrogen atoms which form a part of a hydrogen bonding moiety which is capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Arg-341 of ICE or the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-339 of ICE are excluded from substitution.

Then minimize and reevaluate the energy--this is the free conformation energy. The strain energy for binding of a potential inhibitor to ICE is the difference between the free conformation energy and the bound conformation energy. In a preferred embodiment, the strain energy of an inhibitor of the present invention is less than about 10 kcal/mol.</p><p>The term "patient" as used in this application refers to any mammal, especially humans.</p><p>The term "pharmaceutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective in treating or ameliorating an IL-1 mediated disease in a patient.

Such ring structures may be singly or multiply substituted. Preferably, the ring structures contain between 0 and 3 substituents. When multiply substituted, each substituent may be picked independently of any other substituent as long as the combination of substituents results in the formation of a stable compound.</p><p>Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term "stable", as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and administration to a mammal by methods known in the art.

M.; Humblet, C.; Gund, P.; Barry, D. C., "Molecular Modeling Software and Methods for Medicinal Chemistry", J. Med. Chem., 33, pp. 883-894 (1990)). There are likewise a number of examples in the chemical literature of techniques that can be applied to specific drug design projects. For a review, see: Navia, M. A. and Murcko, M. A., "The Use of Structural Information in Drug Design", Current Opinions in Structural Biology, 2, pp. 202-210 (1992). Some examples of these specific applications include: Baldwin, J. J. et al., "Thienothiopyran-2-sulfonamides: Novel Topically Active Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Glaucoma", J. Med. Chem., 32, pp. 2510-2513 (1989); Appelt, K. et al., "Design of Enzyme Inhibitors Using Iterative Protein Crystallographic Analysis", J. Med. Chem., 34, pp. 1925-1934 (1991); and Ealick, S.

USA, 88, pp. 11540-11544 (1991).</p><p>Using the novel combination of steps of the present invention, the skilled artisan can advantageously avoid time consuming and expensive experimentation to determine enzymatic inhibition activity of particular compounds. The method also is useful to facilitate rational design of ICE inhibitors and therapeutic and prophylactic agents against IL-1-mediated diseases. Accordingly, the present invention relates to such inhibitors.</p><p>A variety of conventional techniques may be used to carry out each of the above evaluations as well as the evaluations necessary in screening a candidate compound for ICE inhibiting activity. Generally, these techniques involve determining the location and binding proximity of a given moiety, the occupied space of a bound inhibitor, the deformation energy of binding of a given compound and electrostatic interaction energies. Examples of conventional techniques useful in the above evaluations include: quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo sampling, systematic searches and distance geometry methods (G. R. Marshall, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 27, p. 193 (1987)). Specific computer software has been developed for use in carrying out these methods. Examples of programs designed for such uses include: Gaussian 92, revision E.2 (M. J. Frisch, Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.  California at San Francisco,  Simulations, Inc., Burlington, Mass.  II/Discover (Biosysm Technologies Inc., San Diego, Calif.  These programs may be implemented, for instance, using a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation or IBM RISC/6000 workstation model 550. Other hardware systems and software packages will be known and of evident applicability to those skilled in the art.</p><p>Different classes of active ICE inhibitors, according to this invention, may interact in similar ways with the various binding pockets of the ICE active site. The spatial arrangement of these important groups is often referred to as a pharmacophore. The concept of the pharmacophore has been well described in the literature (D. Mayer, C. B. Naylor, I. Motoc, and G. R. Marshall, J. Comp. Aided Molec. Design vol. 1, pp. 3-16 (1987); A. Hopfinger and B. J. Burke, in Concepts and Applications of Molecular Similarity, M. A. Johnson and G. M. Maggiora, ed., Wiley (1990)).</p><p>Different classes of ICE inhibitors of this invention may also use different scaffolds or core structures, but all of these cores will allow the necessary moieties to be placed in the active site such that the specific interactions necessary for binding may be obtained. These compounds are best defined in terms of their ability to match the pharmacophore, i.e., their structural identity relative to the shape and properties of the active site of ICE.</p><p>The ICE

Daltons, are preferred. These preferred compounds may be readily absorbed by the bloodstream of patients upon oral administration. This oral availability makes such compounds excellent agents for orally-administered treatment and prevention regimens against IL-1 mediated diseases.</p><p>The ICE inhibitors of this invention may be synthesized using conventional techniques. Advantageously, these compounds are conveniently synthesized from readily available starting materials.</p><p>The compounds of this invention are among the most readily synthesized ICE inhibitors known. Previously described ICE inhibitors often contain four or more chiral centers and numerous peptide linkages. The relative ease with which the compounds of this invention can be synthesized represents an enormous advantage in the large scale production of these compounds.</p><p>It should be understood that the compounds of this invention may exist in various equilibrium forms, depending on conditions including choice of solvent, pH, and others known to the practitioner skilled in the art. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. In particular, many of the compounds of this invention, especially those which contain aldehyde or ketone groups in R.sub.3 and carboxylic acid groups in T, may take hemi-ketal (or hemi-acetal) or hydrated forms, as depicted below: ##STR115##</p><p>Depending on the choice of solvent and other conditions known to the practitioner skilled in the art, compounds of this invention may also take acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal or acetal form: ##STR116##</p><p>In addition, it should be understood that the equilibrium forms of the compounds of this invention may include tautomeric forms. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention.</p><p>It should be understood that the compounds of this invention may be modified by appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. In addition, the compounds may be altered to pro-drug form such that the desired compound is created in the body of the patient as the result of the action of metabolic or other biochemical processes on the pro-drug. Some examples of pro-drug forms include ketal, acetal, oxime, and hydrazone forms of compounds which contain ketone or aldehyde groups, especially where they occur in the R.sub.3 group of the compounds of this invention.</p><p>The compounds of this invention are excellent ligands for ICE. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting events in IL-1 mediated diseases, such as the conversion of precursor IL-1Î² to mature IL-1Î² and, thus, the ultimate activity of that protein in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IL-1Î² to mature IL-1 Î² by inhibiting ICE. Because ICE is essential for the production of mature IL-1, inhibition of that enzyme effectively blocks initiation of IL-1 mediated physiological effects and symptoms, such as inflammation, by inhibiting the production of mature IL-1. Thus, by inhibiting IL-1Î² precursor activity, the compounds of this invention effectively function as IL-1 inhibitors.</p><p>The compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment of diseases which are mediated by IL-1. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a patient suffering from an IL-1 mediated disease in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of that disease.</p><p>Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in compositions and methods for treating or protecting individuals against IL-1 mediated diseases over extended periods of time. The compounds may be employed in such compositions either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of ICE inhibitors in pharmaceutical compositions. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period time against IL-1 mediated diseases.</p><p>The compounds of this invention may also be co-administered with other ICE inhibitors to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various IL-1-mediated diseases.</p><p>In addition, the compounds of this invention may be used in combination either conventional anti-inflammatory agents or with matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, lipoxygenase inhibitors and antagonists of cytokines other than IL-1Î².</p><p>The compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO) or with prostaglandins, to prevent or combat IL-1-mediated disease symptoms such as inflammation.</p><p>When the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention may be comprised of a combination of an ICE inhibitor of this invention and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent.</p><p>Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise any of the compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.

This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant such as Ph.

These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.</p><p>Topical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application.

These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading><p>The following example demonstrates a process of drug design which embodies the present invention:</p><p>Step 1) Pick 2 hydrogen bonding moieties of ICE, here, the backbone CâO and N--H of Arg-341.</p><p>Step 2) Pick a scaffold, here, a pyridone derivative, and confirm that the hydrogen bonding moieties of the scaffold are capable of forming satisfactory hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen bonding moieties selected in step 1. This confirmation is performed by using molecular mechanics techniques to minimize the scaffold fragment intext of the active site of ICE. ##STR117## Step 3) Pick a hydrophobic pocket, here, S2, as next target and a hydrophobic moiety, here, benzene. Minimize the benzene group within the S2 pocket to assure that substantial hydrophobic overlap is obtained. ##STR118## Step 4) Pick another hydrophobic pocket, here, S4, as the next target and a hydrophobic moiety, here, benzene. Minimize the benzene group within the S4 pocket to ensure that substantial hydrophobic overlap is obtained. ##STR119## Step 5) Fill the S1 polar pocket with an electronegative moiety, here, a carboxylate sidechain provided by aspartic acid in which the C-terminus has been reduced to an aldehyde. Minimize to ensure that the carboxylate sidechain retains a favorable electrostatic interaction with the S1 polar pocket. ##STR120## Step 6) Link the scaffold with the moieties from steps 3, 4, and 5, preferably using the minimum number of bonds consistent with a chemically reasonable structure. Minimize the entire composite molecule in the active site of ICE. ##STR121## Step 7) Evaluate the energy of the molecule when it has the conformation necessary for binding to ICE. Then minimize and reevaluate the energy--this is the free conformation energy. The strain energy for binding of the potential inhibitor to ICE is the difference between the free conformation energy and the bound conformation energy. The strain energy should be less than about 10 kcal/mol. In this case the bound conformation energy is -1.6 kcal/mol and the free conformation energy is -11.7 kcal/mol, for a strain energy of 10.1 kcal/mol.</p><p>Step 8) The inhibitor designed using the above steps has been made and has been show to have a K.sub.i of 150 nM.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 2</heading><p>We obtained inhibition constants (K.sub.i) and IC.sub.50 values for several compounds of this invention using the three methods described below:</p><heading>1. Enzyme Assay with UV-visible Substrate</heading><p>This assay is run using an Succinyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-pNitroanilide substrate (SEQ ID no:1). Synthesis of analogous substrates is described by L. A. Reiter (Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 43, 87-96 (1994)). The assay mixture contains:</p><p>65 Î¼l buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @pH 8.1)</p><p>10 Î¼l ICE (50 nM final concentration to give a rate of .sup.Ë 1 mOD/min)</p><p>5 Î¼l DMSO/Inhibitor mixture</p><p>20 Î¼l 400 Î¼M Substrate (80 Î¼M final concentration)</p><p>100 Î¼l total reaction volume</p><p>The visible ICE assay is run in a 96-well microtiter plate. Buffer, ICE and DMSO (if inhibitor is present) are added to the wells in the order listed. The components are left to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes starting at the time that all components are present in all wells. The microtiter plate reader is set to incubate at 37 minute incubation, substrate is added directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored by following the release of the chromophore (pNA) at 405-603 nm at 37 performed and the rate is calculated in mOD/min. DMSO is only present during experiments involving inhibitors, buffer is used to make up the volume to 100 Î¼l in the other experiments.</p><heading>2. Enzyme Assay with Fluorescent Substrate</heading><p>This assay is run essentially according to Thornberry et al. (Nature 356: 768-774 (1992)), using substrate 17 referenced in that article. The substrate is: Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) (SEQ ID no:2). The following components are mixed:</p><p>65 Î¼l buffer(10 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @pH8.1)</p><p>10 Î¼l ICE (2-10 nM final concentration)</p><p>5 Î¼l DMSO/inhibitor solution</p><p>20 Î¼l 150 Î¼M Substrate (30 Î¼M final)</p><p>100 Î¼l total reaction volume</p><p>The assay is run in a 96 well microtiter plate. Buffer and ICE are added to the wells. The components are left to incubate at 37 minutes in a temperature-controlled wellplate. After the 15 minute incubation, the reaction is started by adding substrate directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored @37 following the release of the AMC fluorophore using an excitation wavelength for 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. A linear fit of the data for each well is performed and a rate is determined in fluorescence units per second.</p><p>For determination of enzyme inhibition constants (K.sub.i) or the mode of inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive or noncompetitive), the rate data determined in the enzyme assays at varying inhibitor concentrations are computer-fit to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see I. H. Segel, Enzyme Kinetics, Wiley-Interscience, 1975).</p><heading>3. Cell Assay</heading><p>IL-1Î² Assay with a Mixed Population of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Enriched Adherent Mononuclear Cells</p><p>Processing of pre-IL-1Î² by ICE can be measured in cell culture using a variety of cell sources. Human PBMC obtained from healthy donors provides a mixed population of lymphocyte subtypes and mononuclear cells that produce a spectrum of interleukins and cytokines in response to many classes of physiological stimulators. Adherent mononuclear cells from PBMC provides an enriched source of normal monocytes for selective studies of cytokine production by activated cells.</p><p>Experimental Procedure:</p><p>An initial dilution series of test compound in DMSO or ethanol is prepared, with a subsequent dilution into RPMI-10% FBS media (containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 50 U and 50 ug/ml pen/strep) respectively to yield drugs at 4 or 0.4% ethanol. The final concentration of DMSO is 0.1% for all drug dilutions. A concentration titration which brackets the apparent K.sub.i for a test compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound screen.</p><p>We generally test 5-6 compound dilutions and have performed the cellular component of the assay in duplicate, with duplicate ELISA determinations on each cell culture supernatant.</p><p>PBMC Isolation and IL-1 Assay:</p><p>Buffy coat cells isolated from one pint human blood (yielding 40-45 ml final volume plasma plus cells) are diluted with media to 80 ml and LeukoPREP separation tubes (Becton Dickinson) are each overlaid with 10 ml of cell suspension. After 15 min centrifugation at 1500-1800 plasma/media layer is aspirated and then the mononuclear cell layer is collected with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube (Corning). Media is added to bring the volume to 15 ml, gently mix the cells by inversion and centrifuge at 300 min. Resuspend the PBMC pellet in a small volume of media, count cells and adjust to 6</p><p>For the cellular assay, add 1.0 ml of the cell suspension to each well of a 24-well flat bottom tissue culture plate (Corning), 0.5 ml test compound dilution and 0.5 ml LPS solution (Sigma #L-3012; 20 ng/ml solution prepared in complete RPMI media; final LPS concentration 5 ng/ml). The 0.5 ml additions of test compound and LPS are usually sufficient to mix the contents of the wells. Three control mixtures are run per experiment, with either LPS alone, solvent vehicle control, and/or additional media to adjust the final culture volume to 2.0 ml. The cell cultures are incubated for 16-18 hr at 37</p><p>At the end of the incubation period, cells are harvested and transferred to 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation for 10 min at 200 Eppendorf tubes. It may be noted that the cell pellet may be utilized for a biochemical evaluation of pre-IL-1Î² and/or mature IL-1Î² content in cytosol extracts by western blotting or ELISA with pre-IL-1Î² specific antisera.</p><p>Isolation of Adherent Mononuclear Cells:</p><p>PBMC are isolated and prepared as described above. Media (1.0 ml) is first added to wells followed by 0.5 ml of the PBMC suspension. After a one hour incubation, plates are gently shaken and nonadherent cells aspirated from each well. Wells are then gently washed three times with 1.0 ml of media and final resuspended in 1.0 ml media. The enrichment for adherent cells generally yields 2.5-3îtimes.10.sup.5 cells per well. The addition of test compounds, LPS, cell incubation conditions and processing of supernatants proceeds as described above.</p><p>ELISA:</p><p>We have used Quantikine kits (R&amp;D Systems) for measurement of mature IL-1Î². Assays are performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Mature IL-1Î² levels of about 1-3 ng/ml in both PBMC and adherent mononuclear cell positive controls are observed. ELISA assays are performed on 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions of supernatants from LPS-positive controls to select the optimal dilution for supernatants in the test panel.</p><p>The inhibitory potency of the compounds can be represented by an IC.sub.50 value, which is the concentration of inhibitor at which 50% of mature IL-1Î² is detected in the supernatant as compared to the positive controls.</p><p>The following K.sub.i and IC.sub.50 values were determined for compounds A through N using the indicated assays.
