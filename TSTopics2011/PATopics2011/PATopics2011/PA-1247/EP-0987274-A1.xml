factor VIIa (FVIIa).</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new"  lang="EN"><heading><u style="single">Field of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0001">The present invention relates to novel compounds, their preparation, their use and
pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds which have a strong
antithrombotic effect through reversible inhibition of activated blood coagulation
factor VIIa (FVIIa).</p><heading><u style="single">Background of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0002">Thrombus formation is normally the result of tissue injury which initiate the
coagulation cascade and has the effect of slowing or preventing blood flow in wound
healing. Other factors which are not directly related to tissue injury like
atherosclerosis and inflammation may also initiate the coagulation cascade and may
lead to pathological consequences.</p><p num="0003">Blood coagulation is a complex process involving a progressively amplified series of
enzyme activation reactions in which plasma zymogens are sequentially activated by
limited proteolysis. Mechanistically the blood coagulation cascade has been divided
into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, which converge at the activation of factor X;
subsequent generation of the thrombin proceeds through a single common pathway
(see Scheme 1). <img id="img-00020001"  orientation="unknown"  wi="139" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00020001.tif" inline="no" he="112"/></p><p num="0004">Present evidence suggests that the intrinsic pathway plays an important role in the
maintenance and growth of fibrin formation, while the extrinsic pathway is critical in
the initiation phase of blood coagulation (H. Cole, Aust. J. Med. Chem. 16 (1995) 87;
G.J. Broze, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis &amp;, Suppl.1 (1995) S7-S13). It is
generally accepted that blood coagulation is physically initiated upon formation of a
tissue factor(TF)/factor VIIa complex. Once formed, this complex rapidly initiates
coagulation by activating factors IX and X. The newly generated activated factor X, i.
e. factor Xa, then forms a one-to-one complex with factor Va and phospholipids to
form a prothrombinase complex, which is responsible for converting soluble
fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin via the activation of thrombin from its precursor
prothrombin. As time progresses, the activity of the factor VIIa/tissue factor complex
(extrinsic pathway) is suppressed by a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor protein, TFPI,
which, when complexed to factor Xa, can directly inhibit the proteolytic activity of
factor VIIa/tissue factor. In order to maintain the coagulation process in the presence 
of an inhibited extrinsic system, additional factor Xa is produced via the
thrombin-mediated activity of the intrinsic pathway. Thus, thrombin plays a dual
autocatalytic role, mediating its own production and the conversion of fibrinogen to
fibrin.</p><p num="0005">The autocatalytic nature of thrombin generation is an important safeguard against
uncontrolled bleeding and it ensures that, once a given threshold level of
prothrombinase is present, blood coagulation will proceed to completion. The ability
to form blood clots is vital to survival. In certain disease states, however, the
formation of blood clots within the circulatory system is itself a source of morbidity. It
is nevertheless not desirable in such disease states to completely inhibit the clotting
system because life threatening hemorrhage would ensue. Thus, it is most desirable
to develop agents that inhibit coagulation by inhibition of factor VIIa without directly
inhibiting thrombin.</p><p num="0006">In many clinical applications there is a great need for the prevention of intravascular
blood clots or for some anti-coagulant treatment. The currently available drugs are
not satisfactory in many specific clinical applications. For example, nearly 50 % of
patients who have undergone a total hip replacement develop deep vein thrombosis
(DVT). The currently approved therapies are fixed dose low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) and variable dose heparin. Even with these drug regimes 10 % to
20 % of patients develop DVT and 5 % to 10 % develop bleeding complications.</p><p num="0007">Another clinical situation for which better anticoagulants are needed concerns
subjects undergoing transluminal coronary angioplasty and subjects at risk for
myocardial infarction or suffering from crescendo angina. The present,
conventionally accepted therapy, which consists of administering heparin and
aspirin, is associated with a 6 % to 8 % abrupt vessel closure rate within 24 hours of
the procedure. The rate of bleeding complications requiring transfusion therapy due
to the use of heparin also is approximately 7 %. Moreover, even though delayed 
closures are significant, administration of heparin after termination of the procedures
is of little value and can be detrimental.</p><p num="0008">The most widely used blood-clotting inhibitors are heparin and the related sulfated
polysaccharides, LMWH and heparin sulfate. These molecules exert their
anti-clotting effects by promoting the binding of a natural regulator of the clotting
process, anti-thrombin III, to thrombin and to factor Xa. The inhibitory activity of
heparin primarily is directed toward thrombin, which is inactivated approximately 100
times faster than factor Xa. Hirudin and hirulog are two additional thrombin-specific
anticoagulants presently in clinical trials. However, these anticoagulants, which
inhibit thrombin, also are associated with bleeding complications. Preclinical studies
in baboons and dogs have shown that targeting enzymes involved at earlier stages
of the coagulation cascade, such as factor Xa or factor VIIa, prevents clot formation
without producing the bleeding side effects observed with direct thrombin inhibitors
(T. Yokoyama, A.B Kelly, U.M Marzec, Hanson SR, S Kunitada, L.A Harker,
Circulation 92 (1995),485-491; L.A Harker, S.R Hanson, A.B Kelly, Thromb
Hemostas 74 (1995) 464-472; C.R Benedict, J Ryan, J Todd, K Kuwabara, P Tyburg,
Jr. J Cartwright, D. Stern, Blood 81 (1993, 2059-2066).</p><p num="0009">Specific inhibition of the factor VIIa/TF catalytic complex using monoclonal antibody
(International Application No. WO9206711) and a protein such as chloromethyl
ketone inactivated FVIIa (International Appl. No. WO9612800 and WO9747651) is
an extremely effective means of controlling thrombus formation caused by acute
arterial injury or the thrombotic complications related to bacterial septicemia. There
is also experimental evidence suggesting that inhibition of factor VIIa/TF activity
inhibits restenosis following ballon angioplasty (L.A Harker, S.R Hanson, J.N Wilcox,
A.B Kelly, Haemostasis 26 (1996) S1:76-82). Bleeding studies have been
conducted in baboons and indicate that inhibition of the factor VIIa/TF complex has
the widest safety window with respect to therapeutic effectiveness and bleeding risk
of any anticoagulant approach tested including thrombin, platelet and factor Xa 
inhibition (L.A Harker, S.R Hanson, A.B Kelly, Thromb Hemostas 74 (1995) 464-472).</p><p num="0010">A specific inhibitor of factor VIIa would have substantial practical value in the
practice of medicine. In particular, a factor VIIa inhibitor would be effective under
circumstances where the present drugs of choice, heparin and related sulfated
polysaccharides, are ineffective or only marginally effective. Thus, there exists a
need for a low molecular weight, factor VIIa-specific blood clotting inhibitor that is
effective, but does not cause unwanted side effects. The present invention satisfies
this need by providing factor VIIa activity inhibiting derivatives of formula I and by
providing related advantages as well.</p><p num="0011">The compounds of formula I are inhibitors of the blood clotting enzyme factor VIIa.
The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of the compounds of
formula I, to methods of inhibiting factor VIIa activity and of inhibiting blood clotting,
to the use of the compounds of formula I in the treatment and prophylaxis of
diseases which can be cured or prevented by the inhibition of factor VIIa activity
such as thromboembolic diseases, and restenosis and the use of the compounds of
formula I in the preparation of medicaments to be applied in such diseases. The
invention further relates to compositions containing a compound of formula I in a
mixture or otherwise in association with an inert carrier, in particular pharmaceutical
compositions containing a compound of formula I together with pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier substances and auxiliary substances. </p><heading><u style="single">Summary of the invention</u></heading><p num="0012">The present invention provides compounds that specifically inhibit factor VIIa

tetrafluoroborate and O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate, respectively.</p><p num="0020">As used herein, the term "specific" when used in reference to the inhibition of factor
VIIa activity means that a compound of the formula I can inhibit factor VIIa activity
without substantially inhibiting the activity of other specified proteases, including
plasmin and thrombin (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). Such
proteases are involved in the blood coagulation and fibrinolysis cascade.</p><p num="0021">As used herein, the term "substituent" refers to any of various chemical groups that
is substituted onto the peptide backbone or side chain of a peptide, peptide
analogue, mimetic or organic compound disclosed herein. A substituent can include
any of a variety of different moieties known to those skilled in the art (see, for
example, Giannis and Kolter, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 32:1244-1267 (1993),
which is incorporated herein by reference).</p><p num="0022">As used herein, the term "alkyl" is used in the broadest sense to mean saturated or
unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic chains of about 1 to 13 carbon atoms. Thus,
the term "alkyl" includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, sec-butyl,
1 -methylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, n-pentyl and
n-hexyl groups, alkylene groups, cyclic chains of carbon atoms such cyclohexyl and
cyclopentyl groups, as well as combinations of linear or branched chains and cyclic
chains of carbon atoms such as a methyl-cyclohexyl or cyclopropyl-methylene group.
In addition, it should be recognized that an alkyl as defined herein can be
substituted with a substituent. Similarly, the term "acyl" is used in its broadest sense
to mean saturated or unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic chains of about 1 to 13
carbon atoms or aryl groups having 5 to 13 carbon atoms, which contain a carboxyl
group. Thus, the term "acyl" encompasses, for example, groups such as formyl,
acetyl, benzoyl and the like. </p><p num="0023">Preferably, the term 
<img id="img-00150001" orientation="unknown" wi="1" img-format="tif" img-content="ff" file="00150001.tif" inline="no" he="1"/>alkyl" means saturated, linear or branched chains of from 1 to 6
carbon atoms, unsaturated linear or branched chains of from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or
cyclic alkyl groups of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, preferred of from 4 to 6 carbon
atoms. From the unsaturated alkyl chains, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkenyl and C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkynyl are
preferred.</p><p num="0024">Preferably, the term <imgref idrefs="img-00150001"/>acyl" means the hereinbefore mentioned saturated or
unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic chains having the preferred range of carbon
atoms, which contain a carboxyl group.</p><p num="0025">The term "aryl" refers to aromatic groups containing about 5 to 13 carbon atoms and
at least one "ring" group having a conjugated pi electron system. Preferable, the
term <imgref idrefs="img-00150001"/>aryl" refers to aromatic groups having 6 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples of aryls
include, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, fluorenyl, biphenylyl groups, and analogues
and derivatives thereof, all of which optionally can be substituted with one or more
substituents. The term "arylalkyl" refers to an alkyl as defined above substituted with
one or more, for example two, aryl groups. Suitable arylalkyl groups include benzyl,
phenethyl, diphenylmethyl, diphenylethyl, diphenylpropyl, naphthylmethyl,
naphtylethyl and the like, all of which optionally can be substituted.</p><p num="0026">The terms "heteroalkyl," "heteroarylalkyl" and "heteroaryl" also are used herein and
refer to an alkyl, an arylalkyl and an aryl, respectively, wherein one or more carbon
atoms are replaced with one or more heteroatoms such as a N, O or S atom. In
addition, the term "heterocycloalkyl" is used in reference to a cyclic alkyl group that
is substituted with one or more heteroatoms. Preferably, the term <imgref idrefs="img-00150001"/>heterocycloalkyl"
means a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, of which 1 to 3 are replaced
with hetero atoms such a N, O or S atoms. Suitable heteroaryl groups,
heteroarylalkyl groups and heteroalkyl groups include, for example, pyridyl, thienyl,
indolyl, imidazolyl, furyl, piperonyl, picolyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidyl, tetrahydrofuryl,
morpholinyl, piperazinyl and the like, all of which can optionally be substituted. </p><p num="0027">The peptides of the invention can be modified at the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus
by reaction with suitable reagents or by introduction (or by the presence of)
an amino-protecting group or carboxy-protecting group, respectively. The N-terminus
of a peptide or peptide analog can be chemically modified such that the N-terminus
amino group is substituted, for example, by an acyl group (for example acetyl,
cyclopentylcarboxy, isoquinolylcarboxy, furoyl, tosyl, benzoyl, pyrazinecarboxy or
other such group), by reaction with an isocyanate, chloroformate, alkylating agent or
by introducing other such group, all of which can be substituted by a substituent as
described above. It should be recognized that the term "amino group" is used
broadly herein to refer to any free amino group, including a primary, secondary or
tertiary amino group, present in a peptide. In comparison, the term "N-terminus"
refers to the Œ±-amino group of the first amino acid present in a peptide written in the
conventional manner.</p><p num="0028">The N-terminus of a peptide of the invention can be protected by linking thereto an
amino-protecting group. The term "amino-protecting group" is used broadly herein to
refer to a chemical group that can react with a free amino group, including, for
example, the Œ±-amino group present at the N-terminus of a peptide of the invention.
By virtue of reacting therewith, an amino-protecting group protects the otherwise
reactive amino group against undesirable reactions as can occur, for example,
during a synthetic procedure or due to exopeptidase activity on a final compound.
Modification of an amino group also can provide additional advantages, including,
for example, increasing the solubility or the activity of the compound. Various amino-protecting
groups are disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art and include, for
example, acyl groups such as an acetyl, tert-butyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl,
benzyloxycarbonyl group, benzoyl groups, as well as an aminoacyl residue, which
itself can be modified by an amino-protecting group. Other amino-protecting groups
are described, for example, in The Peptides, eds. Gross and Meienhofer, Vol. 3
(Academic Press, Inc., N.Y. 1981); and by Greene and Wuts, in Protective Groups in
Organic Synthesis 2d ed., pages 309-405 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1991), 
each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The product of any such
modification of the N-terminus amino group of a peptide or peptide analog of the
invention is referred to herein as an "N-terminal derivative."</p><p num="0029">Similarly, a carboxy group such as the carboxy group present at the C-terminus of a
peptide can be chemically modified using a carboxy-protecting group. The terms
"carboxy group" and "C-terminus" are used in a manner consistent with the terms
"amino group" and "N-terminus" as defined above. A carboxy group such as that
present at the C-terminus of a peptide can be modified by reduction of the C-terminus
carboxy group to an alcohol or aldehyde or by formation of an oral ester or
by substitution of the carboxy group with a substituent such as a thiazolyl, cyclohexyl
or other group. Oral esters are well known in the art and include, for example,
alkoxymethyl groups such as methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, iso-propoxymethyl and
the like; the Œ±-(C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>)alkoxyethyl groups such as methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl,
propoxyethyl, isopropoxyethyl and the like; the 2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-ylmethyl groups
such as 5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-ylmethyl, 5-phenyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-ylmethyl
and the like; the C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>3</sub> alkylthiomethyl groups such as methylthiomethyl,
ethylthiomethyl, isopropylthiomethyl and the like; the acyloxymethyl groups such as
pivaloyloxymethyl, Œ±-acetoxymethyl and the like; the ethoxycarbonyl-1-methyl group;
the Œ±-acyloxy-Œ±-substituted methyl groups such as Œ±-acetoxyethyl, the 3-phthalidyl or
5,6-dimethylphthalidyl groups, the 1-(C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> alkyloxycarbonyloxy)eth-1-yl groups
such as the 1-(ethoxycarbonyloxy)eth-1-yl group; and the 1-(C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>
alkylaminocarbonyloxy)eth-1-yl group such as the 1-(methylaminocarbonyloxy)eth-1-yl
group.</p><p num="0030">A peptide of the invention can be modified by linking thereto a carboxy-protecting
group. Carboxy-protecting groups are well known in the art and, by virtue of being
bound to a peptide, protect a carboxy group against undesirable reactions (see, for
example, Greene and Wuts, supra, pages 224-276 (1991), which is incorporated
herein by reference). The skilled artisan would recognize that such modifications as
described above, which can be effected upon the N-terminus amino group or 
C-terminus carboxy group of a peptide, similarly can be effected upon any reactive
amino group or carboxy group present, for example, on a side chain of an amino
acid or amino acid analog in a peptide of the invention. Methods for performing such
modifications are disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art.</p><p num="0031">The choice of including an L- or a D-amino acid in a compound of the present
invention can depend, in part, on the desired characteristics of the peptide. For
example, the incorporation of one or more D-amino acids can confer increased
stability on the compound in vitro or in vivo. The incorporation of one or more D-amino
acids also can increase or decrease the pharmacological activity of the
compound. In some cases it can be desirable to allow the compound to remain
active for only a short period of time. In such cases, the incorporation of one or more
L-amino acids in the compound can allow endogenous peptidases in an individual to
digest the compound in vivo, thereby limiting the individual's exposure to the active
compound. The skilled artisan can determine the desirable characteristics required
of compound of the invention by taking into consideration, for example, the age and
general health of an individual.</p><p num="0032">A compound of the invention can be chemically synthesized using, for example, an
automated synthesizer (see Example I). Selective modification of a reactive group
such as a group present on an amino acid side chain or an N-terminus or a
C-terminus reactive group in a peptide can impart desirable characteristics such as
increased solubility or enhanced inhibitory function to a compound of the invention.</p><p num="0033">Where solid phase synthesis methods are employed, the chemical composition of a
compound can be manipulated while the nascent peptide is attached to the resin or
after the peptide has been cleaved from the resin to obtain, for example, an N-terminal
derivative such as an N-terminus acylated, e. g. acetylated, compound.
Similar modifications also can be made to a carboxy group of a compound, including
a C-terminus carboxy group, which, for example, can be amidated. One skilled in the
art also can synthesize a compound of the invention using solution phase organic 
chemistry. A synthesized compound can be purified using well known methods such
as reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; see Example
I) or other methods of separation based, for example, on the size, charge or
hydrophobicity of the compound. Similarly, well known methods such as amino acid
sequence analysis or mass spectrometry (MS) can be used for characterizing the
structure of a compound of the invention (see Example I).</p><p num="0034">A composition of the present invention can be provided as a homogenous
composition or as a mixture of compounds containing various combinations of
substituents. The flexibility permitted by the choice of substituents permits a great
deal of control over the physico-chemical properties of the peptide compound
analogs. The choice of the substituent also influences the binding affinity of the
compound (see Examples).</p><p num="0035">Various compounds containing different arrangements of the substituents exhibit
different levels of inhibitory activity for factor VIIa. These compounds were
synthesized according to the procedures described in the Examples. Testing the
peptides for inhibitory activity was accomplished using the assay described in
Example 22. Using such methods, one skilled in the art can synthesize a compound
as disclosed herein, including a modification thereof, and determine the factor VIIa
inhibitory activity of the compound.</p><p num="0036">The invention provides compounds that specifically inhibit factor VII activity. Such
compounds preferably have a Ki ‚â§ 500 nM, more preferably ‚â§ 50 nM, for factor VIIa
activity and do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases involved in
coagulation and fibrinolysis cascade relative to the inhibition of factor VIIa (using the
same concentration of the inhibitor). Such other proteases include, for example,
factor Xa, thrombin and plasmin. </p><p num="0037">The following Table 2 shows the factor VIIa inhibitory activities of selected

VIIa inhibitory activities. Also, the factor Xa inhibitory activities of the above
compounds as determined can be expressed in Ki-values which are at least 100
times as high as the above indicated factor VIIa inhibitory activities.</p><p num="0039">These results demonstrate that the compounds of the formula I are useful as
inhibitors of factor VIIa, but do not substantially inhibit the activity of factor Xa or
serine proteases such as thrombine, which are involved in the process of blood
coagulation and fibrinolysis.</p><p num="0040">A compound of the invention can be used advantageously as an anticoagulant,
which can be contacted with a blood sample to prevent coagulation. For example, an
effective amount of a compound of the invention can be contacted with a freshly
drawn blood sample to prevent coagulation of the blood sample. As used herein, the
term "effective amount" when used in reference to a compound of the invention
means an amount of a compound that inhibits factor VIIa activity. The skilled artisan
would recognize that an effective amount of a compound of the invention can be
determined using the methods disclosed herein (see Example 22) or otherwise
known in the art. In view of the disclosed utility of a compound of the invention, the
skilled artisan also would recognize that an agent such as heparin can be replaced
with a compound of the invention. Such a use of a compound of the invention can
result, for example, in a cost saving as compared to other anticoagulants. </p><p num="0041">In addition, a compound of the invention can be administered to an individual for the
treatment of a variety of clinical conditions, including, for example, the treatment of a
cardiovascular disorder or a complication associated, for example, with infection or
surgery. Examples of cardiovascular disorders include restenosis following
angioplasty, adult respiratory disstress syndrome, multi-organ failure, stroke and
disseminated intravascular coagulation clotting disorder. Examples of related
complications associated with surgery include, for example, deep vein and proximal
vein thrombosis, which can occur following surgery. Thus, a compound of the
invention is useful as a medicament for reducing or inhibiting unwanted coagulation
in an individual.</p><p num="0042">Since a compound of the invention can inhibit factor VIIa activity, such a compound
can be useful for reducing or inhibiting blood clotting in an individual. As used
herein, the term "individual" means a vertebrate, including a mammal such as a
human, in which factor VIIa is involved in the clotting cascade.</p><p num="0043">Blood clotting in an individual can be reduced or inhibited by administering to the
individual a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. As used
herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means the dose of a compound
that must be administered to an individual in order to inhibit factor VIIa activity in the
individual. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the
invention inhibits factor VIIa catalytic activity either directly, within the
prothrombinase complex or as a soluble subunit, or indirectly, by inhibiting the
assembly of factor VIIa into the prothrombinase complex. In particular, such
compounds can inhibit factor VIIa activity with a Ki ‚â§ 500 nM and, preferably,
with a Ki ‚â§ 50 nM. A therapeutically effective amount can be determined using the
methods described, for example, in Example 22 or otherwise known in the art.</p><p num="0044">In the practice of a therapeutic method of the invention, the particular dosage to
obtain a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition to be
administered to the individual will depend on a variety of considerations, including, 
for example, the nature or severity of the disease, the schedule of administration and
the age and physical characteristics of the individual. An appropriate dosage can be
established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art. Thus, the
invention provides a method of specifically inhibiting factor VIIa activity by contacting
factor VIIa with a compound having the formula R1-A-B-D-E<sub>n</sub>-R2. The invention
further provides a method of reducing or inhibiting the formation of a blood clot in an
individual by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the
invention.</p><p num="0045">A compound of the invention generally will be administered to an individual as a
composition containing the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a medium or composition
that is non-toxic to an individual or has acceptable toxicity as determined by the
appropriate regulatory agency. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier encompasses any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such
as phosphate buffered saline, water, an emulsion such as an oil/water or water/oil
emulsion, or any of various types of wetting agents. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers
and their formulations are described by Martin (in Remington's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 15th Ed. (Mack Publishing Co., Easton 1975) which is incorporated herein
by reference). Such compositions will, in general, contain a therapeutically effective
amount of a compound of the invention together with a suitable amount of carrier so
as to comprise the proper dosage for administration to an individual. Thus, the
claimed compounds can be useful as medicaments for inhibiting factor VIIa activity
and blood clotting in an individual.</p><p num="0046">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also can include, for example, other mediums,
compounds or modifications to a factor VIIa inhibitor compound that enhances its
pharmacological function. A pharmaceutically acceptable medium can include, for
example, an acid addition salt such as a salt formed with an inorganic acid such as
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid or perchloric acid,
or with an organic acid such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, 
tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid. Other pharmaceutically
acceptable salts include, for example, inorganic nitrate, sulfate, acetate, malate,
formate, lactate, tartrate, succinate, citrate, p-toluenesulfonate, and the like,
including, but not limited to, cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals
such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium or magnesium, as well as non-toxic
ammonium, quaternary ammonium and amine cations such as ammonium,
methylammonium, dimethylammonium, trimethylammonium, tetramethylammonium,
ethylammonium, triethylammonium and tetraethylammonium.</p><p num="0047">Examples of modifications that enhance the pharmacological function of the
compound include, for example, esterification such as the formation of C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>6</sub> alkyl
esters, preferably C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> alkyl esters, wherein the alkyl group is a straight or
branched chain. Other acceptable esters include, for example, C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>7</sub> cycloalkyl
esters and arylalkyl esters such as benzyl esters. Such esters can be prepared from
the compounds described herein using conventional methods well known in the art
of peptide chemistry.</p><p num="0048">Pharmaceutically acceptable modifications also can include, for example, the
formation of peptide amides. Such amide modifications, which can be effected upon
the compounds of the invention, include, for example, those derived from ammonia,
primary C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>6</sub> dialkyl amines, where the alkyl groups are straight or branched
chain, or arylamines having various substitutions. In the case of secondary amines,
the amine also can be in the form of a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle containing, for
example, a nitrogen atom. Methods for preparing such amides are well known in the
art.</p><p num="0049">In another embodiment of the invention, a compound of the invention can be used in
an assay to identify the presence of factor VIIa or to isolate factor VIIa in a
substantially purified form. Preferably, the compound of the invention is labeled with,
for example, a radioisotope, and the labeled compound is detected using a routine
method useful for detecting the particular label. In addition, a compound of the 
invention can be used advantageously as a probe to detect the location or amount of
factor VIIa activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo.</p><p num="0050">It is understood that modifications that do not substantially affect the activity of the

invention. Such methods are described, for example, by Steward and Young (Solid
Phase Peptide Synthesis (Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, 1969), which is

(Rapp Polymere, T√ºbingen, Germany). An acid sensitive linker p-[(R,S)-Œ±-[1-(9H-Fluoren-9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethoxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic
acid (Knorr
Linker) was coupled to the solid support (Bernartowicz, et. al, Tetr. Lett. 30:4645

on polystyrene resin cross-linked with 1 % divinylbenzene modified with an acid 
sensitive linker (Rink resin) (Rink, Tetr. Lett. 28, 3787 (1987); Sieber, Tetr. Lett. 28,
2107 (1987), each of which is incoporated herein by reference). When peptides
were synthesized by first coupling the sidechain carboxylic acid of a compound of
the formula Fmoc-B1-CH(R97)-COOPG to the resin, TentaGel S NH<sub>2</sub> resin modified
by attachment of the HMPA linker was employed. Coupling was performed using
N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) in the presence of an equivalent amount of
HOBt, with the exception of Alloc-pAph-OH, where 2 equivalents of HOBt were used.
All couplings were done in either N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or DMF:DMSO (1:1

ninhydrin test. A second (double) coupling was performed where coupling in the first
instance was incomplete.</p><p num="0054">Deprotection of the Fmoc group was accomplished using 50% piperidine in DMF for
2+10 min. The amount of Fmoc released was determined from the absorbance at

Wildgoose P, Strop P, Discovery of a novel, potent, and specific family of factor Xa
inhibitors via combinatorial chemistry. Biochemistry 1998,37,1053-1059). Kinetic
assays were conducted at 25 ¬∞C in half-area microtiter plates (Costar Corp.,
Cambridge, MA) using a kinetic plate reader (Molecular devices Spectramax 250). A
typical assay consisted of 25 ¬µl human factor VIIa and TF (5 nM and 10 nM,
respective final concentration) combined with 40 ¬µl of inhibitor dilutions in 10%
DMSO/TBS-PEG buffer ( 50 mM Tris, 15mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.05% PEG 8k pH
8.15). Following a 15 minute preincubation period, the assay was initiated by the
addition of 35 ¬µl of the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (D-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA,
Pharmacia Hepar Inc, 500 ¬µM final concentration.). The apparent inhibition
constants were calculated from the slope of the progress curves during the linear
part of the time course, typically between 1 and 5 min following addition of substrate
to the assay. The true Ki was subsequently determined for each compound by
correcting for subtrate concentration (S) and the Km using the formula <st32:f xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">Ki= Ki app/ (1
