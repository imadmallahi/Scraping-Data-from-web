particularly, the present invention relates to lubricating oil compositions, which have
low levels of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur and exhibit low volatility.</p><heading><b><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0002">Various legislative and manufacturer's requirements have created a need for
passenger car engine lubricants that exhibit reduced amounts of chlorine, sulfur and
phosphorus as well as exhibiting reduced volatility. The drive toward reduced
chlorine is due to health and environmental concerns associated with disposal of used
oils. Increasingly tighter emissions requirements have stimulated research into the
effect of the lubricating oil on catalyst efficiency and durability. Results of this
research indicate that reduction of sulfur and phosphorus in the oil will improve
catalyst durability and efficiency. Improved volatility of the lubricating oil results in
greater durability of fuel economy benefits from the lubricant. A second benefit of
improved volatility is the increase in the capability of the lubricant for extended drain.</p><p num="0003">However, the requirement, in particular of reduced phosphorus, in lubricants,
especially of low viscosity lubricants, causes increased wear in the engine.</p><heading><b><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0004">In accordance with the present invention there has been discovered, in a first
aspect, a lubricating oil composition which comprises an admixture of:
<sl><li>(a) a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity selected from the
group consisting of Group II, Group III, Group IV and synthetic ester
base stocks;</li><li>(b) an overbased calcium or magnesium salicylate lubricating oil
detergent;</li><li>(c) an oil soluble organo-molybdenum compound; </li><li>(d) an ashless dispersant; and</li><li>(e) a supplemental antioxidant;
said lubricating oil composition containing less than 0.2 wt.% sulfur, less than 50 ppm
(by weight) chlorine, less than 50 ppm (by weight) phosphorus and having a NOACK
volatility of 15 wt.% or less.</li></sl></p><p num="0005">There is also provided, in a second aspect, a concentrate for blending into a
base stock, selected from Group II, Group III, Group IV and synthetic ester base
stocks, to form a lubricating oil composition as defined in the first aspect, which
concentrate comprises:
<sl><li>(b) an overbased calcium or magnesium salicylate lubricating oil
detergent;</li><li>(c) an oil soluble organo-molybdenum compound;</li><li>(d) an ashless dispersant;</li><li>(e) a supplemental antioxidant; and</li><li>(ai) a diluent oil</li></sl>
wherein ingredients (b) to (ai) are in such proportions so as to form the lubricating oil
composition.</p><p num="0006">Further, the invention provides, in a third aspect, the use of:
<sl><li>(a) a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity selected from the
group consisting of Group II, Group III, Group IV and synthetic ester
basestocks;</li><li>(b) an overbased calcium or magnesium salicylate lubricating oil
detergent;</li><li>(c) an oil soluble organo-molybdenum compound;</li><li>(d) an ashless dispersant; and</li><li>(e) a supplemental antioxidant;</li></sl>
in a lubricating oil composition containing less than 0.2 wt.% sulfur, less than 50 ppm
chlorine (by weight), less than 50 ppm (by weight) phosphorus and a NOACK 
volatility of 15 wt.% or less to improve the performance in, preferably pass, the
Sequence IVA engine test.</p><p num="0007">Preferably, the lubricating oil composition of the invention is a low viscosity
oil composition, such as a multigrade oil composition satisfying the SAE 0W-X or
SAE 5W-X characteristics, where X represents any one of 20, 30 and 40. The SAE
J300 classification defines the lubricants according to their viscometric properties,
such as their maximum low temperature cranking and pumping viscosities and
maximum and minimum kinematic viscosities at 100 ¬∞C.</p><p num="0008">In this specification:
<sl><li>"Major amount" means in excess of 50 mass % of the composition.</li><li>"Minor amount" means less than 50 mass % of the composition, both in respect of the
stated additive and in respect of the total mass % of all of the additives present in the
composition, reckoned as active ingredient of the additive or additives.</li><li>"Comprises or comprising" or cognate words are taken to specify the presence of
stated features, steps, integers, or components, but do not preclude the presence or
addition of one or more other features, steps, integers, components or groups thereof.
In the instance the term "comprising" or comprises" is used herein, the term
"consisting essentially of" and its cognate are within its scope and are a preferred
embodiment of it, and consequently the term "consisting of" and its cognate are
within the scope of "consisting essentially of" and are a preferred embodiment of it.</li><li>"TBN" is Total Base Number as measured by ASTM D2896.</li><li>"Oil-soluble" or "oil-dispersible" does not necessarily indicate that the additives are
soluble, dissolvable, miscible or capable of being suspended in the oil of lubricating
viscosity, in all proportions. They do mean, however, that they are, for example,
soluble or stably dispersible in the oil to an extent sufficient to exert their intended 
effect in the environment in which the oil is employed. Moreover, the additional
incorporation of other additives may also permit incorporation of higher levels of a
particular additive, if desired.</li><li>"ppm" means parts per million, expressed by mass based on the mass of the
lubricating oil composition.</li></sl></p><p num="0009">The abbreviation SAE stands for Society of Automotive Engineers.</p><p num="0010">All percentages reported are mass % on an active ingredient basis, <i>i.e.</i> without regard
to carrier or diluent oil, unless otherwise stated.</p><p num="0011">It should be noted that the lubricating oil compositions of this invention comprise
defined individual, <i>i.e.</i> separate, components that may or may not remain the same
chemically before and after mixing. Thus, it will be understood that various
components of the composition, essential as well as optional and customary, may react
under the conditions of formulation, storage or use, and that the invention also
provides the product obtainable or obtained as a result of any such reaction.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Oil of Lubricating Viscosity</u></b></heading><p num="0012">The oil of lubricating viscosity may be selected from Group II, III or IV base
stocks or synthetic ester base stocks. The basestock groups are defined in the
American Petroleum Institute (API) publication "Engine Oil Licensing and
Certification System", Industry Services Department, Fourteenth Edition, December
1996, Addendum 1, December 1998. The base stock will have a viscosity preferably
of 3-12, more preferably 4-10, most preferably 4.5-8, mm<sup>2</sup>/s (cSt) at 100¬∞C.
<sl><li>(a) Group II mineral oil base stocks contain greater than or equal to 90%
saturates and less than or equal to 0.03% sulfur and have a viscosity
index greater than or equal to 80 and less than 120 using the test
methods specified in Table A below. </li><li>(b) Group III mineral oil base stocks contain greater than or equal to 90%
saturates and less than or equal to 0.03% sulfur and have a viscosity
index greater than or equal to 120 using the test methods specified in
Table A below.</li><li>(c) Group IV base stocks are polyalphaolefins (PAO).</li><li>(d) Suitable ester base stocks that can be used comprise the esters of
dicarboxylic acids (<i>e.g.</i> phthalic acid, succinic acid, alkyl succinic
acids, alkenyl succinic acids, maleic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid,
sebacic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, linoleic acid dimer, malonic
acid, alkyl malonic acids, alkenyl malonic acids, <i>etc.</i>) with a variety of
alcohols (<i>e.g.</i> butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol 2-ethylhexyl
alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoether,
propylene glycol, <i>etc.</i>) Specific examples of these esters include
dibutyl adipate, di(e-ethylhexyl) sebacate, di-n-hexyl fumarate, dioctyl
sebacate, diisooctyl azelate, diisodecyl azelate, dioctyl phthalate,
didecyl phthalate, dieicosyl sebacate, the 2-ethylhexyl diester of
linoleic acid dimer, the complex ester formed by reacting one mole of
sebacic acid with two moles of tetraethylene glycol and two moles of
2-ethylhexanoic acid and the like.</li></sl></p><p num="0013">Esters useful as synthetic base stock oils also include those made from C<sub>5</sub> to
C<sub>12</sub> monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyol ethers, such as neopentyl glycol,

Group III base stock. Mineral oils are preferred.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Calcium or Magnesium Salicylate Detergent</u></b></heading><p num="0015">The present invention requires the presence of at least one overbased calcium
or magnesium salicylate lubricating oil detergent. Detergents aid in reducing deposits
that build up in an engine and act as an acid neutralizer or rust inhibitor. This in turn
reduces engine wear and corrosion.</p><p num="0016">The calcium or magnesium salicylate detergent used in this invention is
preferably overbased and may be C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>30</sub> alkyl salicylates or mixtures thereof, with
C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>20</sub> alkyl salicylates being particularly preferred. Preferably, the detergent has a
Total Base Number (TBN) between 100 and 500, more preferably between 150 and
450, and most preferably between 200 and 400. The most preferred detergent for use
in this invention is an overbased calcium alkyl salicylate having a TBN between 200
and 400.</p><p num="0017">The process of overbasing a metal detergent means that a stoichiometric
excess of the metal is present over what is required to neutralize the anion of the salt.
It is the excess metal from overbasing that has the effect of neutralizing acids which
may build up.</p><p num="0018">In the present invention, the amount of calcium or magnesium salicylate
detergents used can vary broadly, but typically will be from about 0.5 to about 5 wt.%,
preferably 0.5 to 1.5 wt.%, based on the total weight of the composition.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Molybdenum Compound</u></b></heading><p num="0019">For the lubricating oil compositions of this invention, any suitable oil soluble
organo-molybdenum compound may be employed. The molybdenum compound will

soluble organo-molybdenum compounds are the dialkyldithiocarbamates,
dialkyldithiophosphates, dialkyldithiophosphinates, xanthates, thioxanthates,
carboxylates and the like, and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred are
molybdenum dialkylthiocarbamates.</p><p num="0020">The molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate dimer to be used as an additive in the

groups are hydrocarbyl groups such as alkyl (<i>e.g.</i> in which the carbon atom attached to
the remainder of the ligand is primary or secondary), aryl, substituted aryl and ether
groups. More preferably, each ligand has the same hydrocarbyl group.</p><p num="0023">The term "hydrocarbyl" denotes a substituent having carbon atoms directly
attached to the remainder of the ligand and is predominantly hydrocarbyl in character
within the context of this invention. Such substituents include the following:
<sl><li>1. Hydrocarbon substituents, that is aliphatic (for example, alkyl or
alkenyl), alicyclic (for example, cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl) substituents, aromatic-,
aliphatic- and alicyclic-substituted aromatic nuclei and the like, as well as cyclic
substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the ligand (that is
any two indicated substituents may together form an alicyclic group).</li><li>2. Substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is those containing non-hydrocarbon
groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the
predominantly hydrocarbyl character of the substituent. Those skilled in the art will be
aware of suitable groups (<i>e.g.</i> halo, especially chloro and fluoro, amino, alkoxyl,
mercapto, alkylmercapto, nitro, nitroso, sulfoxy, <i>etc.</i>).</li></sl></p><p num="0024">Importantly, the organo groups of the ligands have a sufficient number of carbon
atoms to render the compound soluble in the oil. For example, the number of carbon
atoms in each group will generally range between about 1 to about 100, preferably from
about 1 to about 30, and more preferably between about 4 to about 20. Preferred ligands
include dialkyldithiophosphate, alkylxanthate, carboxylates, dialkyldithiocarbamate, and 
mixtures thereof. Most preferred are the dialkyldithiocarbamates. Those skilled in the
art will realize that formation of the compounds of the present invention requires
selection of ligands having the appropriate charge to balance the core's charge (as
discussed below).</p><p num="0025">Compounds having the formula Mo<sub>3</sub> S<sub>k</sub> L<sub>n</sub> X<sub>b</sub> Y<sub>d</sub> have cationic cores

charge among all the ligands (L) and ions (<i>e.g.</i> X &amp; Y) must be -4. Four monoanionic
ligands are preferred. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that two
or more trinuclear cores may be bound or interconnected by means of one or more
ligands and the ligands may be multidentate, <i>i.e.</i> having multiple connections to one or
more cores. It is believed that oxygen and/or selenium may be substituted for sulfur in
the core(s).</p><p num="0026">Oil-soluble trinuclear molybdenum compounds are preferred and can be

may be reacted with a ligand source such as a dialkyldithiocarbamate or

trinuclear molybdenum compound. The appropriate liquid/solvent may be, for example,
aqueous or organic.</p><p num="0027">The ligand chosen must have a sufficient number of carbon atoms to render the

This oil had 0.17 wt.% sulfur, no phosphorus and 22.8 ppm chlorine and a NOACK
volatility less than 15% and contained 850 ppm molybdenum. <img id="img-00170001" orientation="unknown" wi="149" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00170001.tif" inline="no" he="41"/>
The Sequence IVA fired engine test is part of the ILSAC GF-3 and API SL specifications for passenger
car engine oils. The test measures the ability of the oil to provide wear protection to the valve train.
The performance limits require a maximum of 120 microns of wear. The formulation exhibits excellent
results against the specified limits. Current passenger car motor oil technology uses phosphorus in the
form of zinc dithiophosphate (ZDDP) to ensure passing performance against this requirement. Most oils
meeting this requirement are formulated with about 1000 ppm of phosphorus from ZDDP.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>A lubricating oil composition which comprises an admixture of
