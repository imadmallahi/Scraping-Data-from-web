Regardless of the nature of the cell surface receptor (e.g. protein tyrosine kinase or seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled), protein kinases and phosphatases along with phopholipases are the essential machinery by which the signal is further transmitted within the cell [Marshall, J. C. Cell, 80, 179-278 (1995)]. Protein kinases can be categorized into five classes with the two major classes being, tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases depending upon whether the enzyme phosphorylates its substrate(s) on specific tyrosine(s) or serine/threonine(s) residues [Hunter, T., Methods in Enzymology (Protein Kinase Classification) p. 3, Hunter, T.; Sefton, B. M.; eds. vol. 200, Academic Press; San Diego, 1991].</p><p>For most biological responses, multiple intracellular kinases are involved and an individual kinase can be involved in more than one signaling event. These kinases are often cytosolic and can translocate to the nucleus or the ribosomes where they can affect transcriptional and translational events, respectively. The involvement of kinases in transcriptional control is presently much better understood than their effect on translation as illustrated by the studies on growth factor induced signal transduction involving MAP/ERK kinase [Marshall, C. J. Cell, 80, 179 (1995); Herskowitz, I. Cell, 80, 187 (1995); Hunter, T. Cell, 80, 225 (1995); Seger, R., and Krebs, E. G. FASEB J., 726-735 (1995)].</p><p>While many signaling pathways are part of cell homeostasis, numerous cytokines (e.g., IL-1 and TNF) and certain other mediators of inflammation (e.g., COX-2, and iNOS) are produced only as a response to stress signals such as bacterial lippopolysaccharide (LPS). The first indications suggesting that the signal transduction pathway leading to LPS-induced cytokine biosynthesis involved protein kinases came from studies of Weinstein [Weinstein, et al., J. Immunol. 151, 3829(1993)] but the specific protein kinases involved were not identified. Working from a similar perspective, Han [Han, et al., Science 265, 808(1994)] identified murine p38 as a kinase which is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS. Definitive proof of the involvement of the p38 kinase in LPS-stimulated signal transduction pathway leading to the initiation of proinflammatory cytokine biosynthesis was provided by the independent discovery of p38 kinase by Lee [Lee; et al., Nature, 372, 739(1994)] as the molecular target for a novel class of anti-inflammatory agents. The discovery of p38 (termed by Lee as CSBP 1 and 2) provided a mechanism of action of a class of anti-inflammatory compounds for which SK&amp;F 86002 was the prototypic example. These compounds inhibited IL-1 and TNF synthesis in human monocytes at concentrations in the low mM range [Lee, et al., Int. J. Immunopharmac. 10(7), 835(1988)] and exhibited activity in animal models which are refractory to cyclooxygenase inhibitors [Lee; et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci., 696, 149(1993)].</p><p>It is now firmly established that CSBP/p38 is a one of several kinases involved in a stress-response signal transduction pathway which is parallel to and largely independent of the analogous mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase cascade (FIG. 1). Stress signals, including LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidants, UV light and osmotic stress, activate kinases upstream from CSBP/p38 which in turn phosphorylate CSBP/p38 at threonine 180 and tyrosine 182 resulting in CSBP/p38 activation. MAPKAP kinase-2 and MAPKAP kinase-3 have been identified as downstream substrates of CSBP/p38 which in turn phosphorylate heat shock protein Hsp 27 (FIG. 2). It is not yet known whether MAPKAP-2, MAPKAP-3, Mnk1 or Mnk2 are involved in cytokine biosynthesis or alternatively that inhibitors of CSBP/p38 kinase might regulate cytokine biosynthesis by blocking a yet unidentified substrate downstream from CSBP/p38 [Cohen, P. Trends Cell Biol., 353-361(1997)].</p><p>What is known, however, is that in addition to inhibiting IL-1 and TNF, CSBP/p38 kinase inhibitors (SK&amp;F 86002 and SB 203580) also decrease the synthesis of a wide variety of pro-inflammatory proteins including, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF and COX-2. Inhibitors of CSBP/p38 kinase have also been shown to suppress the TNF-induced expression of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, the TNF-induced phosphorylation and activation of cytosolic PLA2 and the IL-1-stimulated synthesis of collagenase and stromelysin. These and additional data demonstrate that CSBP/p38 is involved not only cytokine synthesis, but also in cytokine signaling [CSBP/P38 kinase reviewed in Cohen, P. Trends Cell Biol., 353-361(1997)].</p><p>Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are biological substances produced by a variety of cells, such as monocytes or macrophages. IL-1 has been demonstrated to mediate a variety of biological activities thought to be important in immunoregulation and other physiological conditions such as inflammation [See, e.g., Dinarello et al., Rev. Infect. Disease, 6, 51 (1984)]. The myriad of known biological activities of IL-1 include the activation of T helper cells, induction of fever, stimulation of prostaglandin or collagenase production, neutrophil chemotaxis, induction of acute phase proteins and the suppression of plasma iron levels.</p><p>There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-1 production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease. These include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, other acute or chronic inflammatory disease states such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease; tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, cachexia, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, and acute synovitis. Recent evidence also links IL-1 activity to diabetes and pancreatic β cells [review of the biological activities which have been attributed to IL-1 Dinarello, J. Clinical Immunology, 5 (5), 287-297 (1985)].</p><p>Excessive or unregulated TNF production has been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of disease including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions; sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia, secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or pyresis.</p><p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic factor produced by several cell types including mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes. Its production from endothelial cells is induced by IL-1, TNF, or lipopolysachharide (LPS). IL-8 stimulates a number of functions in vitro. It has been shown to have chemoattractant properties for neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and basophils. In addition it induces histamine release from basophils from both normal and atopic individuals as well as lysozomal enzyme release and respiratory burst from neutrophils. IL-8 has also been shown to increase the surface expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) on neutrophils without de novo protein synthesis, this may contribute to increased adhesion of the neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells. Many diseases are characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration. Conditions associated with an increased in IL-8 production (which is responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophil into the inflammatory site) would benefit by compounds which are suppressive of IL-8 production.</p><p>IL-1 and TNF affect a wide variety of cells and tissues and these cytokines as well as other leukocyte derived cytokines are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. The inhibition of these cytokines is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.</p><p>Inhibition of signal transduction via CSBP/p38, which in addition to IL-1, TNF and IL-8 described above is also required for the synthesis and/or action of several additional pro-inflammatory proteins (i.e., IL-6, GM-CSF, COX-2, collagenase and stromelysin), is expected to be a highly effective mechanism for regulating the excessive and destructive activation of the immune system. This expectation is supported by the potent and diverse anti-inflammatory activities described for CSBP/p38 kinase inhibitors [Badger, et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Thera. 279 (3): 1453-1461.(1996); Griswold, et al, Pharmacol. Comm. 7, 323-229 (1996)].</p><p>There remains a need for treatment, in this field, for compounds which are cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs, i.e. compounds which are capable of inhibiting the CSBP/p38/RK kinase.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 demonstrates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase

All of these exemplified compounds are useful in the method of treatment of CSBP kinase mediated diseases.</p><p>It is also noted that representative compounds of Formula (A) and (B) may be found in Table 1.</p><p>The compounds of Formula (I) may be obtained by applying synthetic procedures, some of which are illustrated in Schemes I to XI herein. The synthesis provided for in these Schemes is applicable for the producing compounds of Formula (I) having a variety of different R.sub.1, R.sub.2, and R.sub.4 groups which are reacted, employing optional substituents which are suitably protected, to achieve compatibility with the reactions outlined herein. Subsequent deprotection, in those cases, then affords compounds of the nature generally disclosed. While the schemes describe compounds of Formula (I) with Y as oxygen, one skilled in the art would readily be able to make compounds of Formula (I) wherein Y is sulfur using similar reaction processes as exemplified herein.</p><p>Precursors of the groups R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.4 can be other R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.4 groups which can be interconverted by applying standard techniques for functional group interconversion. For example a compound of the formula (I) wherein R.sub.2 is halo substituted C.sub.1-10 alkyl can be converted to the corresponding C.sub.1-10 alkylN.sub.3 derivative by reacting with a suitable azide salt, and thereafter if desired can be reduced to the corresponding C.sub.1-10 alkylNH.sub.2 compound, which in turn can be reacted with R.sub.18 S(0).sub.2 X wherein X is halo (e.g., chloro) to yield the corresponding C.sub.1-10 alkylNHS(0).sub.2 R.sub.18 compound.</p><p>Alternatively a compound of the formula (I) where R.sub.2 is halo-substituted C.sub.1-10 -alkyl can be reacted with an amine R.sub.13 R.sub.14 NH to yield the corresponding C.sub.1-10 -alkylNR.sub.13 R.sub.14 compound, or can be reacted with an alkali metal salt of R.sub.18 SH to yield the corresponding C.sub.1-10 alkylSR.sub.18 compound. ##STR5##</p><p>Scheme I, shown above, may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,992, Adams et al., whose disclosure is incorporated by referene herein in its entirety. Compunds of Formula (I) are suitably prepared by reacting a compound of the Formula (II), with a compound of the Formula (III) wherein p is 0 or 2, R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.4 are as defined herein, for Formula (I), or are precursors of the groups R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.4, and Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl group, and thereafter if necessary converting a precursor of R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.4 to a group R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.4. It is recognized that R.sub.2 NH2 which is reacted with R.sub.1 CHO to form the imine, Formula (III) the R.sub.2 moiety when it contains a reactive functional group, such as a primary or secondary amine, an alcohol, or thiol compound the group must be suitably protected. Suitable protecting groups may be found in, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene T W, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1981, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. For instance, when R.sub.2 is a heterocyclic ring, such as a piperidine ring, the nitrogen is protected with groups such as t-Boc, CO.sub.2 R.sub.18, or a substitued arylalkyl moiety.</p><p>Suitably, the reaction is performed at ambient temperature or with cooling (e.g. -50 methylene chloride, DMF, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, acetonitrile, or dimethoxyethane in the presence of an appropriate base such as K.sub.2 CO.sub.3, t-buNH.sub.2, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0.]undec-7-ene (DBU), or a guanidine base such as 1,5,7-triaza-bicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene(TBD). The intermediates of formula (II) have been found to be very stable and capable of storage for a long time. Preferably, p is 2. PTC is defined as a phase transfer catalyst for use herein.</p><p>Compounds of the Formula (II) have the structure: ##STR6##</p><p>wherein p is 0, or 2; R.sub.4 is as defined for Formula (I) and Ar is an optionally substituted aryl as defined herein. Suitably, Ar is phenyl optionally substituted by C.sub.1-4 alkyl, C.sub.1-4 alkoxy or halo. Preferably Ar is phenyl or 4-methylphenyl, i.e. a tosyl derivative.</p><p>Reaction a compound of the Formula (II) wherein p=2, with a compound of the Formula (III)-Scheme I gives consistently higher yields of compounds of Formula (I) than when p=0. In addition, the reaction of Formula (II) compounds wherein p=2 is more environmentally and economically attractive. When p=0, the preferred solvent used is methylene chloride, which is environmentally unattractive for large scale processing, and the preferred base, TBD, is also expensive, and produces some byproducts and impurities, than when using the commercially attractive synthesis (p=2) as further described herein.</p><p>As noted, Scheme I utilizes the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of an anion of a substituted aryl thiomethylisocyanide (when p=0) to an imine. More specifically, this reaction requires a strong base, such as an amine base, to be used for the deprotonation step. The commercially available TBD is preferred although t-butoxide, Li+ or Na+, or K+ hexamethyldisilazide may also be used. While methylene chloride is the prefered solvent, other halogenated solvents, such as chloroform or carbon tetrachloride; ethers, such as THF, DME, DMF, diethylether, t-butyl methyl ether; as well as acetonitrile, toluene or mixtures thereof can be utilized. The reaction may take place from about -20 preferably from about 0 from about 0 4 compunds wherein R.sub.1 is pyridine, it is recognized that varying the reations conditions of both temperature and solvent may be necessary, such as decreasing temperatures to about -50 to THF.</p><p>In a further process, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by coupling a suitable derivative of a compound of Formula (IX): ##STR7## wherein T.sub.1 is hydrogen and T.sub.4 is R.sub.4, or alternatively T.sub.1 is R.sub.1 and T.sub.4 is H in which R.sub.1, R.sub.2 and R.sub.4 are as hereinbefore defined; with (i) when T.sub.1 is hydrogen, a suitable derivative of the heteroaryl ring R.sub.1 H, under ring coupling conditions, to effect coupling of the heteroaryl ring R.sub.1 to the imidazole nucleus at position 5; (ii) when T.sub.4 is hydrogen, a suitable derivative of the aryl ring R.sub.4 H, under ring coupling conditions, to effect coupling of the aryl ring R.sub.4 to the imidazole nucleus at position 4.</p><p>Such aryl/heteroaryl coupling reactions are well known to those skilled in the art. In general, an organometallic synthetic equivalent of an anion of one component is coupled with a reactive derivative of the second component, in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The anion equivalent may be formed from either the imidazole of Formula (IX), in which case the aryl/heteroaryl compound provides the reactive derivative, or the aryl/heteroaryl compound in which case the imidazole provides the reactive derivative. Accordingly, suitable derivatives of the compound of Formula (IX) or the aryl/heteroaryl rings include organometallic derivatives such as organomagnesium, organozinc, organostannane and boronic acid derivatives and suitable reactive derivatives include the bromo, iodo, fluorosulfonate and trifluoromethanesulphonate derivatives. Suitable procedures are described in WO 91/19497, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p>Suitable organomagnesium and organozinc derivatives of a compound of Formula (IX) may be reacted with a halogen, fluorosulfonate or triflate derivative of the heteroaryl or aryl ring, in the presence of a ring coupling catalyst, such as a palladium (O) or palladium (II) catalyst, following the procedure of Kumada et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 22, 5319 (1981). Suitable such catalysts include tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)palladium and PdCl.sub.2 [1,4-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-butane], optionally in the presence of lithium chloride and a base, such as triethylamine. In addition, a nickel (II) catalyst, such as Ni(II)Cl.sub.2 (1,2-biphenylphosphino)ethane, may also be used for coupling an aryl ring, following the procedure of Pridgen et al., J. Org. Chem, 1982, 47, 4319. Suitable reaction solvents include hexamethylphosphoramide. When the heteroaryl ring is 4-pyridyl, suitable derivatives include 4-bromo- and 4-iodo-pyridine and the fluorosulfonate and triflate esters of 4-hydroxy pyridine. Similarly, suitable derivatives for when the aryl ring is phenyl include the bromo, fluorosulfonate, triflate and, preferably, the iodo-derivatives. Suitable organomagnesium and organozinc derivatives may be obtained by treating a compound of Formula (IX) or the bromo derivative thereof with an alkyllithium compound to yield the corresponding lithium reagent by deprotonation or transmetallation, respectively. This lithium intermediate may then be treated with an excess of a magnesium halide or zinc halide to yield the corresponding organometallic reagent.</p><p>A trialkyltin derivative of the compound of Formula (IX) may be treated with a bromide, fluorosulfonate, triflate, or, preferably, iodide derivative of an aryl or heteroaryl ring compound, in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, preferably containing 10% hexamethylphosphoramide, in the presence of a suitable coupling catalyst, such as a palladium (0) catalyst, for instance tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium, by the method described in by Stille, J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1987, 109, 5478, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,719,218 and 5,002,942, or by using a palladium (II) catalyst in the presence of lithium chloride optionally with an added base such as triethylamine, in an inert solvent such as simethyl formamide. Trialkyltin derivatives may be conveniently obtained by metallation of the corresponding compound of Formula (IX) with a lithiating agent, such as s-butyl-lithium or n-butyllithium, inan ethereal solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, or treatment of the bromo derivative of the corresponding compound of Formula (IX) with an alkyl lithium, followed, in each case, by treatment with a trialkyltin halide. Alternatively, the bromo- derivative of a compound of Formula (IX) may be treated with a suitable heteroaryl or aryl trialkyl tin compound in the presence of a catalyst such as tetrakis-(triphenyl-phosphine)-palladium, under conditions similar to those described above.</p><p>Boronic acid derivatives are also useful. Hence, a suitable derivative of a compound of Formula (IX), such as the bromo, iodo, triflate or fluorosulphonate derivative, may be reacted with a heteroaryl- or aryl-boronic acid, in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium or PdCl.sub.2 [1,4-bis-(diphenyl-phosphino)-butane] in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate, under reflux conditions, in a solvent such as dimethoxyethane (see Fischer and Haviniga, Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays Bas, 84, 439, 1965, Snieckus, V., Tetrahedron Lett., 29, 2135, 1988 and Terashimia, M., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 11, 4755, 1985). Non-aqueous conditions, for instance, a solvent such as DMF, at a temperature of about 100 in the presence of a Pd(II) catalyst may also be employed (see Thompson W J et al, J Org Chem, 49,5237, 1984). Suitable boronic acid derivatives may be prepared by treating the magnesium or lithium derivative with a trialkylborate ester, such as triethyl, tri-iso-propyl or tributylborate, according to standard procedures.</p><p>In such coupling reactions, it will be readily appreciated that due regard must be exercised with respect to functional groups present in the compounds of Formula (IX). Thus, in general, amino and sulfur substituents should be non-oxidized or protected.</p><p>Compounds of Formula (IX) are imidazoles and may be obtained by any of the procedures herein before described for preparing compounds of Formula (I). In particular, an α-halo-ketone or other suitably activated ketones R.sub.4 COCH.sub.2 Hal (for compounds of Formula (IX) in which T.sub.1 is hydrogen) or R.sub.1 COCH.sub.2 Hal (for compounds of Formula (IX) in which T.sub.4 is hydrogen) may be reacted with an amidine of the formula R.sub.2 NH--C═NH, wherein R.sub.2 is as defined in Formula (I), or a salt thereof, in an inert solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, for instance chloroform, at a moderately elevated temperature, and, if necessary, in the presence of a suitable condensation agent such as a base. The preparation of suitable a-halo-ketones is described in WO 91/19497. Suitable reactive esters include esters of strong organic acids such as a lower alkane sulphonic or aryl sulphonic acid, for instance, methane or p-toluene sulphonic acid. The amidine is preferably used as the salt, suitably the hydrochloride salt, which may then be converted into the free amidine in situ, by employing a two phase system in which the reactive ester is in an inert organic solvent such as chloroform, and the salt is in an aqueous phase to which a solution of an aqueous base is slowly added, in dimolar amount, with vigorous stirring. Suitable amidines may be obtained by standard methods, see for instance, Garigipati R, Tetrahedron Letters, 190, 31, 1989.</p><p>Compounds of Formula (I) may also be prepared by a process which comprises reacting a compound of Formula (IX), wherein T.sub.1 is hydrogen, with an N-acyl heteroaryl salt, according to the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,803,279, U.S. Pat. No. 4,719,218 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,942, to give an intermediate in which the heteroaryl ring is attached to the imidazole nucleus and is present as a 1,4-dihydro derivative thereof, which intermediate may then be subjected to oxidative-deacylation conditions (Scheme II). The heteroaryl salt, for instance a pyridinium salt, may be either preformed or, more preferably, prepared in situ by adding a substituted carbonyl halide (such as an acyl halide, an aroyl halide, an arylalkyl haloformate ester, or, preferably, an alkyl haloformate ester, such as acetyl bromide, benzoylchloride, benzyl chloroformate, or, preferably, ethyl chloroformate) to a solution of the compound of Formula (IX) in the heteroaryl compound R.sub.1 H or in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride to which the heteroaryl compound has been added. Suitable deacylating and oxidizing conditions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,803,279, 4,719,218 and 5,002,942, which references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Suitable oxidizing systems include sulfur in an inert solvent or solvent mixture, such as decalin, decalin and diglyme, p-cymene, xylene or mesitylene, under reflux conditions, or, preferably, potassium t-butoxide in t-butanol with dry air or oxygen. ##STR8##</p><p>In a further process, illustrated in Scheme III below, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by treating a compound of Formula (X) thermally or with the aid of a cyclising agent such as phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentachloride (see Engel and Steglich, Liebigs Ann Chem, 1978, 1916 and Strzybny et al., J Org Chem, 1963, 28, 3381). Compounds of Formula (X) may be obtained, for instance, by acylating the corresponding a-keto-amine with an activated formate derivative such as the corresponding anhydride, under standard acylating conditions followed by formation of the imine with R.sub.2 NH.sub.2. The aminoketone may be derived from the parent ketone by oxamination and reduction and the requisite ketone may in turn be prepared by decarboxylation of the beta-ketoester obtained from the condensation of an aryl (heteroaryl) acetic ester with the R.sub.1 COX component. ##STR9##</p><p>In Scheme IV illustrated below, two (2) different routes which use ketone (formula XI) for preparing a compound of Formula (I). A heterocyclic ketone (XI) is prepared by adding the anion of the alkyl heterocycle such as 4-methyl-quinoline (prepared by treatment thereof with ana lkyl lithium, such as n-butyl lithium) to an N-alkyl-O-alkoxybenzamide, ester, or any other suitably activated derivative of the same oxidation state. Alternatively, the anion may be condensed with a benzaldehyde, to give an alcohol which is then oxidized to the ketone (XI). ##STR10##</p><p>In a further process, N-substituted compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by treating the anion of an amide of Formula (XII):</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->R.sub.1 CH.sub.2 NR.sub.2 COH                              (XII)</pre></p><p>wherein R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 with:</p><p>(a) a nitrile of the Formula (XIII):</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->R.sub.4 CN                                                 (XIII)</pre></p><p>wherein R.sub.4 is as hereinbefore defined, or</p><p>(b) an excess of an acyl halide, for instance an acyl chloride, of the Formula (XIV):</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->R.sub.4 COHal                                              (XIV)</pre></p><p>wherein R.sub.4 is as hereinbefore defined and Hal is halogen, or a corresponding anhydride, to give a bis-acylated intermediate which is then treated with a source of ammonia, such as ammonium acetate. ##STR11##</p><p>One variation of this approach is illustrated in Scheme V above. A primary amine (R.sub.2 NH.sub.2) is treated with a halomethyl heterocycle of Formula R.sub.1 CH.sub.2 X to give the secondary amine which is then converted to the amide by standard tecniques. Alternatively the amide may be prepared as illustrated in scheme V by alkylation of the formamide with R.sub.1 CH.sub.2 X. Deprotonation of this amide with a strong amide base, such as lithium di-iso-propyl amide or sodium bis-(trimethylsilyl)amide, followed by addition of an excess of an aroyl chloride yields the bis-acylated compound which is then closed to an imidazole compound of Formula (I), by heating in acetic acid containing ammonium acetate. Alternatively, the anion of the amide may be reacted with a substituted aryl nitrile to produce the imidazole of Formula (I) directly.</p><p>The following description and schemes are further exemplification of the process as previously described above in Scheme I. Various pyrimidine aldehyde derivatives 6, as depicted in scheme VI below, can be prepared by modification of the procedures of Bredereck et al. (Chem. Ber. 1964, 97, 3407whose disclosure is incorporated by reference herein. These pyrimidine aldehydes are then utilized as intermediates in the synthesis as further described herein. ##STR12##</p><p>The reaction of imines with tosylmethyl isonitriles was first reported by van Leusen (van Leusen, et al., J. Org. Chem. 1977, 42, 1153.) Reported were the following conditions: tert butyl amine(tBuNH.sub.2) in dimethoxyethane (DME), K.sub.2 CO.sub.3 in MeOH, and NaH in DME. Upon re-examination of these conditions each was found produce low yields. A second pathway involving amine exchange to produce the t-butyl imine followed by reaction with the isocyanide to produce a I-tBu imidazole was also operating. This will likely occur using any primary amine as a base. The secondary amines, while not preferred may be used, but may also decompose the isonitrile slowly. Reactions will likely require about 3 equivalents of amine to go to completion, resulting in approximately 50% isolated yields. Hindered secondary amines (diisopropylamine) while usable are very slow and generally not too effective. Use of tertiary and aromatic amines, such as pyridine, and triethylamine gave no reaction under certain test conditions, but more basic types such as DBU, and 4-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP) while slow, did produce some yields and hence may be suitable for use herein.</p><p>As depicted in Schemes VII and VIII below, the pyrimidine aldehydes of Scheme VI, can be condensed with a primary amine, to generate an imine, which may suitably be isolated or reacted in situ, with the desired isonitrile in the presence of a variety of suitable bases, and solvents as described herein to afford the 5-(4-pyrimidinyl)-substituted imidazoles, wherein R.sub.2 and R.sub.4 are as defined herein for Formula (I) compounds.</p><p>One preferred method for preparing compounds of Formula (I) is shown below in Scheme VII. The imines, prepared and isolated in a separate step were often tars, which were hard to handle. The black color was also often carried over into the final product. The yield for making the imines varied, and environmentally less-acceptable solvents, such as CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 were often used in their prepration.</p><p>This reaction, wherein p=2, requires a suitable base for the reaction to proceed. The reaction requires a base strong enough to deprotonate the isonitrile. Suitable bases include an amine, a carbonate, a hydride, or an alkyl or aryl lithium reagent; or mixtures thereof. Bases include, but are not limited to, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, primary and secondary amines, such as t-butylamine, diisopropyl amine, morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, and other non-nucleophilic bases, such as DBU, DMAP and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO).</p><p>Suitable solvents for use herein, include but are not limited to N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF), MeCN, halogenated solvents, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, benzene, or toluene, DME or EtOAc. Preferably the solvent is DMF, DME, THF, or MeCN, more preferably DMF. Product isolation may generally be accomplished by adding water and filtering the product as a clean compound. ##STR13##</p><p>While not convenient for large scale work, addition of NaH to the isonitrile, perhaps with temperatures lower than 25 are likely needed. Additionally, BuLi has also been reported to be an effective base for deprotonating tosyl benzylisonitriles at -50 (DiSanto, et al. Synth. Commun. 1995, 25, 795).</p><p>Various temperature conditions may be utilized depending upon the preferred base. For instance, tBuNH.sub.2 /DME, K.sub.2 CO.sub.3 /MeOH, K.sub.2 CO.sub.3 in DMF, at temperatures above 40 to about 20% but little difference is expected between 0 25 above 80 this invention. Preferably, the temperature ranges are from about 0 is generally depicted as 25 vary from 20</p><p>As shown in Scheme VIII below, the imine is preferably formed in situ in a solvent. This preferred synthesis, is a process which occurs as a one-pot synthesis. Suitably, when the primary amine is utilized as a salt, such as in the dihydrochloride salt in the Examples, the reaction may further include a base, such as potassium carbonate prior to the addition of the isonitrile. Alternatively, the piperidine nitrogen may be required to be protected (PG) as shown below, suitably the PG is BOC or C(O).sub.2 R, wherein R is preferably alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl moieties well known to those skilled in the art. Reaction conditions, such as solvents, bases, temperatures, etc. are similar to those illustrated and discussed above for the isolated imine as shown in Scheme VII. One skilled in the art would readily recognize that under some circumstances, the in situ formation of the imine may require dehydrating conditions, or may require acid catalysts. ##STR14##</p><p>Scheme IX, describes an alternative process for making compounds of formula (I). In this particular instance, the alkylthio moiety is oxidized to the methyl sulfinyl or sulfonyl moiety which is reacted with a suitable YR.sub.a moiety. ##STR15##</p><p>Another embodiment of the present invention is the novel hydrolysis of 2-thiomethylpyrimidine acetal to 2-thiomethylpyrimidine aldehyde, as shown in Scheme X below. Hydrolysis of the acetal to aldehyde using various known reaction conditions, such as formic acid, did not produce a satisfactory yield of the aldehyde, &amp;lt;13%) was obtained. The preferred synthesis involves the use of AcOH (fresh) as solvent and concentrated H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 under heating conditions, preferably a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. Heating conditions include temperatures from about 60 to 85 temperatures show a darkening of the reaction mixture. After the reaction is completed the mixture is cooled to about room temperature and the acetic acid is removed. A more preferred alternative procedure to this involves heating the acetal in 3N HCl at 40 cooling and extracting the bicarbonate neutralized solution into EtOAc. ##STR16##</p><p>The final 2-(RaY)pyrimidin-4-yl imidazole compounds of Formula (I), as well as similar pyridine containing compounds can be prepared by one of three methods: 1) direct reaction of the 2-(RaY)pyrimidine imine with the isonitrile; 2) oxidation of the 2-alkylthiopyrimidine derivative to the corresponding sulfoxide followed by displacement with the desired HYRa under basic conditions, for example using a metal salt of HYRa or in the presence of a non-nucleophilic amine or alkali metal base; or 3) reaction of the 2-halopyrimidine or pyridine imine with the isonitrile followed by displacement with HYRa under basic conditions described in the second method, see also Adams et al., U.S. Ser. No. 08/659,102 filed Jun. 3, 1996, Scheme XI, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p>While these schemes herein are presented, for instance, with an optionally substituted piperidine moiety for the resultant R.sub.2 position, or a 4-fluoro phenyl for R.sub.4, any suitable R.sub.2 moiety or R.sub.4 moiety may be added in this manner if it can be prepared on the primary amine. Similarly, any suitable R.sub.4 can be added via the isonitrile route.</p><p>The compounds of Formula (II), in Scheme I, may be prepared by the methods of van Leusen et al., supra. For example a compound of the Formula (II) may be prepared by dehydrating a compound of the Formula (IV)-Scheme I, wherein Ar, R.sub.4 and p are as defined herein.</p><p>Suitable dehydrating agents include phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosgene, or tosyl chloride in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or similar bases, etc. such as pyridine. Suitable solvents are dimethoxy ether, tetrahydrofuran, or halogenated solvents, preferably THF. The reaction is most efficient when the reaction temperatures are kept between -10 C. and 0 at higher temperatures, the solution turns dark and the product yield drops.</p><p>The compounds of formula (IV)-Scheme I may be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula (V)-Scheme I, R.sub.4 CHO where R.sub.4 is as defined herein, with ArS(0).sub.p H and formamide with or without water removal, preferably under dehydrating conditions, at ambient or elevated temperature e.g. 30 optionally in the presence of an acid catalyst. Alternatively trimethysilylchloride can be used in place of the acid catalyst. Examples of acid catalysts include amphor-10-sulphonic acid, formic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, hydrogen chloride or sulphuric acid.</p><p>An optimal method of making an isonitrile of Formula (II) is illustrated below, in Scheme XI. ##STR17##</p><p>The conversion of the substituted aldehyde to the tosylbenzyl formamide may be accomplished by heating the aldehyde, 1-Scheme XI, with an acid, such as p-toluene-sulfonic acid, formic acid or camphorsulfonic acid; with formamide and p-toluene-sulfonic acid [under reaction conditions of about 60 reaction, may give poor yields (&amp;lt;30%) when solvents, such as DMF, DMSO, toluene, acetontrile, or excess formamide are used.

In this preferred route, preparation of the bis-formamide from the aldehyde is accomplished by heating the aldehyde with formamide, in a suitable solvent with acid catalysis. Suitable solvents are toluene, acetronitrile, DMF, and DMSO or mixtures thereof. Acid catalysts, are those well known in the art, and include but are not limited to hydrogen chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, and other anhydrous acids. The reaction can be conducted at temperatures ranging from about 25 C., preferably about 50 longer reaction times are also acceptable.

Complete conversion of the product generally requires water removal from the reaction mixture.</p><p>Preferred conditions for converting a bis-formamide derivative to the tosyl benzyl formamide are accomplished by heating the bisformamide in a suitable solvent with an acid catalyst and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Solvents for use in this reaction include but are not limited to toluene, and acetonitrile or mixtures thereof.

Preferably, acids used include but are not limited to, toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, and hydrogen chloride and other anhydrous acids. Most preferably the bisformamide is heated in toluene:acetonitrile in a 1:1 ratio, with p-toluenesulfonic acid and hydrogen chloride.</p><p>Another embodiment of the present invention is the preferred synthetic route for synthesis of the tosylbenzyl formamide compound which is accomplished using a one-pot procedure. This process first converts the aldehyde to the bis-formamide derivative and subsequently reacts the bis-formamide derivative with toluenesulfinic acid. This procedure combines the optimized conditions into a single, efficient process. High yields, &amp;gt;90% of the aryl benzylformamide may be obtained in such a manner.</p><p>Preferred reaction conditions employ a catalyst, such as trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl), in a preferred solvent, toluene:acetonitrile, preferably in a 1:1 ratio. A reagent, such as TMSCl, is preferred which reacts with water produced therein and at the same time produces hydrogen chloride to catalyze the reaction. Also preferred is use of hydrogen chloride and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Therefore, three suitable reaction conditions for use herein include 1) use of a hydrating agent which also provides hydrogen chloride, such as TMSCl; or by 2) use of a suitable dehydrating agent and a suitable source of acid source, such as but not limited to, camphorsulfonic acid, hydrogen chloride or toluenesulfonic acid; and 3) alternative dehydrating conditions, such as the azetropic removal of water, and using an acid catalyst and p-toluene sulfinic acid.</p><p>Compounds of the formula (II) where p is 2 may also be prepared by reacting in the presence of a strong base a compound of the formula (VI)-Scheme I, R.sub.4 CH.sub.2 NC with a compound of the formula (VII)-Scheme I, ArSO.sub.2 L.sub.1 wherein R.sub.4 and Ar are as defined herein and L.sub.1 is a leaving group such as halo, e.g. fluoro.

The inhibition of these pro-inflammatory cytokines is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.</p><p>Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating a cytokine-mediated disease which comprises administering an effective cytokine-interfering amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p>Compounds of Formula (I) are capable of inhibiting inducible proinflammatory proteins, such as COX-2, also referred to by many other names such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2) and are therefore of use in therapy. These proinflammatory lipid mediators of the cyclooxygenase (CO) pathway are produced by the inducible COX-2 enzyme. Regulation, therefore of COX-2 which is responsible for the these products derived from arachidonic acid, such as prostaglandins affect a wide variety of cells and tissues are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. Expression of COX-1 is not effected by compounds of Formula (I). This selective inhibition of COX-2 may alleviate or spare ulcerogenic liability associated with inhibition of COX-1 thereby inhibiting prostoglandins essential for cytoprotective effects. Thus inhibition of these pro-inflammatory mediators is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states. Most notably these inflammatory mediators, in particular prostaglandins, have been implicated in pain, such as in the sensitization of pain receptors, or edema. This aspect of pain management therefore includes treatment of neuromuscular pain, headache, cancer pain, and arthritis pain.

These include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, stroke, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, other acute or chronic inflammatory disease states such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, multiple sclerosis, cachexia, bone resorption, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis and acute synovitis. Recent evidence also links IL-1 activity to diabetes, pancreatic β cells and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>In a further aspect, this invention relates to a method of inhibiting the production of TNF in a mammal in need thereof which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p>Excessive or unregulated TNF production has been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and pyresis.</p><p>Compounds of Formula (I) are also useful in the treatment of viral infections, where such viruses are sensitive to upregulation by TNF or will elicit TNF production in vivo.

These diseases are characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration such as, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. All of these disease are associated with increased IL-8 production which is responsible for the chemotaxis of neutrophils into the inflammatory site. In contrast to other inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF, and IL-6), IL-8 has the unique property of promoting neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. Therefore, the inhibition of IL-8 production would lead to a direct reduction in the neutrophil infiltration.</p><p>The compounds of Formula (I) are administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit cytokine, in particular IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 to TNF, production such that it is regulate down to normal levels, or in some case to subnormal levels, so as to ameliorate or prevent the disease state. Abnormal levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF, for instance in the context of the present invention, constitute: (i) levels of free (not cell bound) IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF greater than or equal to 1 picogram per ml; (ii) any cell associated IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF; or (iii) the presence of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF mRNA above basal levels in cells or tissues in which IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF, respectively, is produced.</p><p>The discovery that the compounds of Formula (I) are inhibitors of cytokines, specifically IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF is based upon the effects of the compounds of Formula (I) on the production of the IL-1, IL-8 and TNF in in vitro assays which are described herein.</p><p>As used herein, the term "inhibiting the production of IL-1 (IL-6, IL-8 or TNF)" refers to:</p><p>a) a decrease of excessive in vivo levels of the cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) in a human to normal or sub-normal levels by inhibition of the in vivo release of the cytokine by all cells, including but not limited to monocytes or macrophages;</p><p>b) a down regulation, at the genomic level, of excessive in vivo levels of the cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) in a human to normal or sub-normal levels;</p><p>c) a down regulation, by inhibition of the direct synthesis of the cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) as a postranslational event; or</p><p>d) a down regulation, at the translational level, of excessive in vivo levels of the cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF) in a human to normal or sub-normal levels.</p><p>As used herein, the term "TNF mediated disease or disease state" refers to any and all disease states in which TNF plays a role, either by production of TNF itself, or by TNF causing another monokine to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1, IL-6 or IL-8. A disease state in which, for instance, IL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in response to TNF, would therefore be considered a disease stated mediated by TNF.</p><p>As used herein, the term "cytokine" refers to any secreted polypeptide that affects the functions of cells and is a molecule which modulates interactions between cells in the immune, inflammatory or hematopoietic response. A cytokine includes, but is not limited to, monokines and lymphokines, regardless of which cells produce them. For instance, a monokine is generally referred to as being produced and secreted by a mononuclear cell, such as a macrophage and/or monocyte. Many other cells however also produce monokines, such as natural killer cells, fibroblasts, basophils, neutrophils, endothelial cells, brain astrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, epidermal keratinocytes and B-lymphocytes. Lymphokines are generally referred to as being produced by lymphocyte cells. Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to, Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Tumor Necrosis Factor beta (TNF-62).</p><p>As used herein, the term "cytokine interfering" or "cytokine suppressive amount" refers to an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) which will cause a decrease in the in vivo levels of the cytokine to normal or sub-normal levels, when given to a patient for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state which is exacerbated by, or caused by, excessive or unregulated cytokine production.</p><p>As used herein, the cytokine referred to in the phrase "inhibition of a cytokine, for use in the treatment of a HIV-infected human" is a cytokine which is implicated in (a) the initiation and/or maintenance of T cell activation and/or activated T cell-mediated HIV gene expression and/or replication and/or (b) any cytokine-mediated disease associated problem such as cachexia or muscle degeneration.</p><p>As TNF-β (also known as lymphotoxin) has close structural homology with TNF-α (also known as cachectin) and since induces similar biologic response and binds to the same cellular receptor, both TNF-a and TNF-β are inhibited by the compounds of the present invention and thus are herein referred to collectively as "TNF" unless specifically delineated otherwise.</p><p>A new member of the MAP kinase family, alternatively termed CSBP, p38, or RK, has been identified independently by several laboratories recently. Activation of this novel protein kinase via dual phosphorylation has been observed in different cell systems upon stimulation by a wide spectrum of stimuli, such as physiocochemical stress and treatment with lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor. The cytokine biosynthesis inhibitors, of the present invention, compounds of Formula (I) have been determined to be potent and selective inhibitors of CSBP/p38/RK kinase activity. These inhibitors are of aid in determining the signaling pathways involvement in inflammatory responses. In particular, for the first time a definitive signal transduction pathway can be prescribed to the action of lipopolysaccharide in cytokine production in macrophages. In addition to those diseases already noted, treatment of stroke, neurotrauma, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, angiogenesis &amp; related processes, such as cancer, thrombosis, glomerulonephritis, diabetes and pancreatic β cells, multiple sclerosis, muscle degeneration, eczema, psoriasis, sunburn, and conjunctivitis are also included.</p><p>The cytokine inhibitors were subsequently tested in a number of animal models for anti-inflammatory activity. Model systems were chosen that were relatively insensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibitors in order to reveal the unique activities of cytokine suppressive agents. The inhibitors exhibited significant activity in many such in vivo studies. Most notable are its effectiveness in the collagen-induced arthritis model and inhibition of TNF production in the endotoxic shock model. In the latter study, the reduction in plasma level of TNF correlated with survival and protection from endotoxic shock related mortality. Also of great importance are the compounds effectiveness in inhibiting bone resorption in a rat fetal long bone organ culture system.

Other chronic diseases which have an excessive or increased proliferation of vasculature are tumor growth and metastasis, atherosclerosis, and certain arthritic conditions. Therefore CSBP kinase inhibitors will be of utility in the blocking of the aniogenic component of these disease states.</p><p>The term "excessive or increased proliferation of vasculature inappropriate angiogenesis" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, diseases which are characterized by hemangiomas and ocular diseases.</p><p>The term "inappropriate angiogenesis" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, disease which are characterized by vesicle proliferation with accompanying tissue proliferation, such as occurs in cancer, metastasis, arthritis and artherosclerosis.</p><p>Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating a CSBP kinase mediated disease in a mammal in need thereof, preferably a human, which comprises administering to said mammal, an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p>In order to use a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, it will normally be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. This invention, therefore, also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective, non-toxic amount of a compound of Formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.</p><p>Compounds of Formula (I), pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and pharmaceutical compositions incorporating such may conveniently be administered by any of the routes conventionally used for drug administration, for instance, orally, topically, parenterally or by inhalation. The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered in conventional dosage forms prepared by combining a compound of Formula (I) with standard pharmaceutical carriers according to conventional procedures. The compounds of Formula (I) may also be administered in conventional dosages in combination with a known, second therapeutically active compound. These procedures may involve mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation. It will be appreciated that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable character or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration and other well-known variables. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.</p><p>The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include time delay material well known to the art, such as glyceryl mono-stearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax.</p><p>A wide variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but preferably will be form about 25 mg. to about 1 g. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparations will be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid such as an ampule or nonaqueous liquid suspension.</p><p>Compounds of Formula (I) may be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound of Formula (I) externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration.</p><p>Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose. The active ingredient may comprise, for topical administration, from 0.001% to 10% w/w, for instance from 1% to 2% by weight of the formulation. It may however comprise as much as 10% w/w but preferably will comprise less than 5% w/w, more preferably from 0.1% to 1% w/w of the formulation.</p><p>Lotions according to the present invention include those suitable for application to the skin or eye. An eye lotion may comprise a sterile aqueous solution optionally containing a bactericide and may be prepared by methods similar to those for the preparation of drops. Lotions or liniments for application to the skin may also include an agent to hasten drying and to cool the skin, such as an alcohol or acetone, and/or a moisturizer such as glycerol or an oil such as castor oil or arachis oil.</p><p>Creams, ointments or pastes according to the present invention are semi-solid formulations of the active ingredient for external application. They may be made by mixing the active ingredient in finely-divided or powdered form, alone or in solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous fluid, with the aid of suitable machinery, with a greasy or non-greasy base. The base may comprise hydrocarbons such as hard, soft or liquid paraffin, glycerol, beeswax, a metallic soap; a mucilage; an oil of natural origin such as almond, corn, arachis, castor or olive oil; wool fat or its derivatives or a fatty acid such as steric or oleic acid together with an alcohol such as propylene glycol or a macrogel. The formulation may incorporate any suitable surface active agent such as an anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactant such as a sorbitan ester or a polyoxyethylene derivative thereof. Suspending agents such as natural gums, cellulose derivatives or inorganic materials such as silicaceous silicas, and other ingredients such as lanolin, may also be included.</p><p>Drops according to the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions and may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable aqueous solution of a bactericidal and/or fungicidal agent and/or any other suitable preservative, and preferably including a surface active agent. The resulting solution may then be clarified by filtration, transferred to a suitable container which is then sealed and sterilized by autoclaving or maintaining at 98-100 may be sterilized by filtration and transferred to the container by an aseptic technique. Examples of bactericidal and fungicidal agents suitable for inclusion in the drops are phenylmercuric nitrate or acetate (0.002%), benzalkonium chloride (0.01%) and chlorhexidine acetate (0.01%). Suitable solvents for the preparation of an oily solution include glycerol, diluted alcohol and propylene glycol.</p><p>Compounds of Formula (I) may be administered parenterally, that is by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal or intraperitoneal administration. The subcutaneous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally preferred. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration may be prepared by conventional techniques. Compounds of Formula (I) may also be administered by inhalation, that is by intranasal and oral inhalation administration. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration, such as an aerosol formulation or a metered dose inhaler, may be prepared by conventional techniques.</p><p>For all methods of use disclosed herein for the compounds of Formula (I), the daily oral dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.1 to about 80 mg/kg of total body weight, preferably from about 0.2 to 30 mg/kg, more preferably from about 0.5 mg to 15 mg. The daily parenteral dosage regiment about 0.1 to about 80 mg/kg of total body weight, preferably from about 0.2 to about 30 mg/kg, and more preferably from about 0.5 mg to 15 mg/kg. The daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.1 mg to 150 mg, administered one to four, preferably two or three times daily. The daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg per day. It will also be recognized by one of skill in the art that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof will be determined by the nature and extent of the condition being treated, the form, route and site of administration, and the particular patient being treated, and that such optimums can be determined by conventional techniques. It will also be appreciated by one of skill in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the number of doses of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof given per day for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional course of treatment determination tests.</p><p>The novel compounds of Formula (I) may also be used in associated with the veterinary treatment of mammals, other than humans, in need of inhibition of cytokine inhibition or production. In particular, cytokine mediated diseases for treatment, therapeutically or prophylactically, in animals include disease states such as those noted herein in the Methods of Treatment section, but in particular viral infections. Examples of such viruses include, but are not limited to lentivirus infections such as, equine infectious anaemia virus, caprine arthritis virus, visna virus, or maedi virus or retrovirus infections, such as but not limited to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus, or canine immunodeficiency virus or other retroviral infections.</p><p>The invention will now be described by reference to the following biological examples which are merely illustrative and are not to be construed as a limitation of the scope of the present invention.</p><heading>BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES</heading><p>The cytokine-inhibiting effects of compounds of the present invention may be determined by the following in vitro assays:</p><p>Assays for Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) are well known in the art, and may be found in a number of publications, and patents.
