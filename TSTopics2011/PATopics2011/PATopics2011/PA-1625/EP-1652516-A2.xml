<img id="iaf01" orientation="unknown" wi="65" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" file="imgaf001.tif" inline="no" he="92"/></p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><heading><u style="single">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="p0001">This invention pertains to the controlled delivery of pharmaceutical agents and dosage forms therefor. In particular, the invention is directed to improved methods, dosage forms and devices for the substantially complete release of active agents from dosage forms having an expandable push layer and a drug layer that is to be dispensed to the environment of use.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="p0002">Certain drugs may have to be delivered in large doses, sometimes several times per day, to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. While large daily doses of drug may be administered by multiple dosing throughout the day, multiple dosing regimens are often not preferred because of patient compliance problems, potential side effects and the dangers of overdosing. Accordingly, there has been a movement to once-a-day or twice-a-day dosing regimens when possible, even when there is a need for large doses of drug to be delivered over a prolonged period, for example 12 hours to 24 hours, as the case may be.</p><p num="p0003">High ranges of daily dosing may require drug loading in drug compositions of the dosage forms to be as much as 20% to 90% or more of the overall weight of the composition. Such loading requirements may present problems in formulating compositions and fabricating dosage forms that are suitable for oral administration and can be swallowed without undue difficulty. High drug loading may present even greater problems when formulating dosage forms that are to be administered a limited number of times per day, such as for once-a-day dosing, because of the large unit dosage form required.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p num="p0004">Various devices and methods have been described having intended utility with respect to applications with high drug loading. For example, US Patent Nos. 4,892,778 and 4,940,465 describe dispensers for delivering a beneficial agent to an environment of use that include a semipermeable wall defining a compartment containing a layer of expandable material that pushes a drug layer out of the compartment formed by the wall. The exit orifice in the device is substantially the same diameter as the inner diameter of the compartment formed by the wall.</p><p num="p0005">US Patent No. 4,915,949 describes a dispenser for delivering a beneficial agent to an environment of use that includes a semipermeable wall containing a layer of expandable material that pushes a drug layer out of the compartment formed by the wall. The drug layer contains discrete tiny pills dispersed in a carrier. The exit orifice in the device is substantially the same diameter as the inner diameter of the compartment formed by the wall.</p><p num="p0006">US Patent No. 5,126,142 describes a device for delivering an ionophore to livestock that includes a semipermeable housing in which a composition containing the ionophore and a carrier and an expandable hydrophilic layer is located, along with an additional element that imparts sufficient density to the device to retain it in the rumen-reticular sac of a ruminant animal. The ionophore and carrier are present in a dry state during storage and the composition changes to a dispensable, fluid-like state when it is in contact with the fluid environment of use. A number of different exit arrangements are described, including a plurality of holes in the end of the device and a single exit of varying diameter to control the amount of drug released per unit time due to diffusion and osmotic pumping.</p><p num="p0007">Other devices in which the drug composition is delivered as a slurry, suspension or solution from a small exit orifice by the action of an expandable layer are described in U. S. Patents Nos. 5,660,861, 5,633,011; 5,190,765; 5,252,338; 5,620,705; 4,931,285; 5,006,346; 5,024,842; and 5,160,743. Typical devices include an expandable push layer and a drug layer surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. In certain instances, the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> drug layer is provided with a subcoat to protect the drug composition in those portions of the gastrointestinal tract having acidic pH, to delay release of the drug composition to the environment of use or to form an annealed coating in conjunction with the semipermeable membrane. However, such devices generally are not well suited as dosage forms for high drug loading due to size requirements necessary to accommodate large amounts of drug in a slurry, suspension or solution, and the need to have an oral dosage form conveniently sized so that it can be swallowed.</p><p num="p0008">Another dosage form is disclosed in US Patent 5,536,507 that describes a three component pharmaceutical formulation that utilizes, inter alia, a pH sensitive polymer, optionally including an osmotic agent, that will swell in the higher pH regions of the lower portion of the small intestine and the large intestine to release drug in those environments. Additional components of the dosage form include a delayed release coating and an enteric coating to provide a dosage form that releases very little, if any, of the drug in the stomach, a relatively minimal amount in the small intestine and reportedly about 85% or more in the large intestine. Such a dosage form provides a widely varying time-release of drug after administration that may not begin for 1-3 hours until the dosage form has passed from the stomach and an additional 3 hours or more for the dosage form to pass into the large intestine.</p><p num="p0009">US Patent 5,169,638 describes a buoyant controlled release pharmaceutical powder formulation to be filled into capsules that uses a pH dependent polymer formed from alginic acid and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose to release pharmaceuticals at a controlled rate. It appears from the disclosure that the capsule formulation was intended to mimic the characteristics of a tableted formulation.</p><p num="p0010">In the case of high drug loading, it is often preferable that a large orifice, from about 50%-100% of the inner diameter of the drug compartment, is provided in the dispensing device so that the drug layer can be dispensed in a non-fluid state. When exposed to the environment of use,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> drug is released from the drug layer by erosion and diffusion. A common problem associated with the release of drug from prior art dosage forms in which the drug layer is dispensed from the delivery device in a dry state is that a residual amount of drug often is left in the device and not released to the subject. Upwards of 20-30% of the drug loading of the composition may remain in the device without being released. In order to compensate for that deficiency, prior art methods have routinely provided for overloading of drug such that the required amount is delivered notwithstanding that a substantial amount remains unreleased in the delivery device. Loading an excess amount of drug further exacerbates the problems of dosage forms that are large and difficult to swallow. Also, the added cost may be significant for active agents having a high material or manufacturing cost. Consequently, there is a need for improved delivery devices having an expandable push layer and a drug layer suitable for use with high drug loading that release substantially all of the drug from the device to the environment of use.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="p0011">In one aspect, the invention comprises a delivery device for an active agent comprising a wall defining a cavity, the wall having an exit orifice formed or formable therein and at least a portion of the wall being semipermeable; an expandable layer located within the cavity remote from the exit orifice and in fluid communication with the semipermeable portion of the wall; a drug layer located within the cavity adjacent the exit orifice and in direct or indirect contacting relationship with the expandable layer; and a flow-promoting layer interposed between the inner surface of the wall and at least the external surface of the drug layer located within the cavity.</p><p num="p0012">In another aspect, the invention comprises an article of manufacture comprising a compressed drug composition overcoated with a flow-promoting layer.

Preferred uniform rates of release will vary by not more than 25% (positively or negatively) from the mean rate of release determined over a prolonged period of time.</p><p num="p0018">By "prolonged period of time" or "prolonged period" is meant a continuous period of time of 4 hours or more, more typically 6 hours or more.</p><p num="p0019">By "dosage form" is meant a pharmaceutical composition or device comprising an active pharmaceutical agent, the composition or device optionally containing inactive ingredients, such as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, excipients, suspension agents, surfactants, disintegrants, binders, diluents, lubricants stabilizers, antioxidants, osmotic agents, colorants, plasticizers, and the like, that are used to manufacture and deliver active pharmaceutical agents.</p><p num="p0020">By "pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salt" or "pharmaceutically-acceptable salt", which are used interchangeably herein, are meant those salts in which the anion does not contribute significantly to the toxicity or pharmacological activity of the salt, and, as such, they are the pharmacological equivalents of the bases of the compounds to which they refer.

It is understood that reagents of equivalent grade may be substituted in the assay in accordance with generally-accepted procedures.</p><p num="p0027">By "dry state" or "substantially dry state" is meant that the composition forming the drug layer of the dosage form is expelled from the dosage form in a plug-like state, the composition being sufficiently dry or so highly viscous that it does not readily flow as a liquid stream from the dosage form under the pressure exerted by the push layer.</p><p num="p0028">One of the most suitable devices for the controlled release of drugs that require high loading in the dosage form to deliver an amount of drug having the desired therapeutic effect is that having a semipermeable wall defining a compartment, an expandable push layer and a drug layer in the compartment, and an exit orifice formed in the dosage form to permit the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> drug layer to be dispensed in a substantially dry state to the environment of use. When manufacturing such dosage forms, a common practice is to fabricate a compressed tablet comprising the drug layer and the push layer. Typically, the push layer composition, conveniently in granulated or powdered form, is compressed in a die cavity of a vertical tableting press. Then the drug layer composition, also conveniently in granular or powdered form, is placed in the die cavity above the push layer and compressed as well to form a bilayer tablet. Although the surface of the die cavity is quite smooth, the formed bilayer tablet may still be formed with surface irregularities. This is more of a problem with the drug layer, particularly when high drug loading is involved such that the amounts of lubricant, carrier and binder used may be limited due to size constraints, than with the push layer.</p><p num="p0029">In many applications the irregularities in the drug layer as described above may be of little importance. However, when the drug layer is to be dispensed in a dry state from the compartment formed by the semipermeable wall, the outer surface of the drug layer is pushed along the inner surface of the semipermeable wall. Resistance to movement of the drug layer will be present because of the frictional force existing between the two surfaces. The degree of resistance will increase as the number and degree of irregularities in the external surface of the drug layer and the inner surface of the semipermeable wall increase. Furthermore, because it is practical to form the semipermeable wall by coating the bilayer drug core, the inner surface of the semipermeable wall will initially conform to the irregularities present in the external surface of the drug layer. Then when the drug layer is forced to move past the semipermeable wall, the irregularities on the external surface of the drug layer must be forced over the irregularities on the inner surface of the semipermeable wall. This creates friction and resistance to movement of the respective layers: While each of the surfaces is substantially a solid, it is convenient to view the relative movement of (i) the drug layer or drug layer/push layer composite<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and (ii) the semipermeable outer wall as a "flow" of the drug layer from the device as the push layer expands. Thus, the inner layer or subcoat is characterized as a "flow-promoting" layer. In effect, the flow-promoting layer is a layer of material interposed between the external surface of the drug layer and the internal surface of the semipermeable wall that reduces friction between the two and facilitates the relative movement between them as fluid passes through the semipermeable wall and is imbibed by the expandable layer.</p><p num="p0030">In systems without the flow promoting layer, the resistance between the drug layer and the outer semipermeable wall may create several problems. One is that the magnitude of the force resisting transport of the drug layer may be a function of the relative positions of the drug layer and the outer wall at any period in time. Variations in the magnitude of the resisting force may cause variations in the rate at which the drug layer is expressed to the environment of use. This would then cause variations in the release of drug from the dosage form and potentially variations in drug plasma levels of drug in the subject over time. As can be seen from the release profiles of the dosage forms described herein, with the practice of the invention active agent is uniformly released from the dosage forms over a prolonged period of time. Such uniform release may provide significant pharmacological advantages in the delivery of active agents.</p><p num="p0031">Secondly, without the flow promoting layer being present, a portion of the drug layer tends to "stick" to the inner surface of the outer wall and remain in the dosage form as the rest of the drug layer is expressed to the environment of use by the expanding layer. This residual amount of undispensed drug may be large; residual amounts of more than 20% to 30% of the initial drug layer loading have been observed under conditions of high drug loading.</p><p num="p0032">The invention provides a dosage form, article of manufacture and method for the substantially complete release of a drug from the dosage form, particularly from dosage forms that may require high drug loading in<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> order to have the desired pharmacological effect. Dosage forms prepared in accordance with this invention may result in a depleted dosage form retaining 20% or less by weight, preferably 10% or less by weight, and most preferably 5% or less by weight of the initial amount of drug loaded in the dosage form when tested in a standard release rate assay.</p><p num="p0033">High ranges of drug dosing, e.g. 100 to 2,000 mg of drug per unit dose, may require drug loading in the compositions to be administered of 20% to 90% or more of the overall weight of the composition. Such loading requirements may present problems in formulating compositions and fabricating devices that are suitable for oral administration and can be swallowed without undue difficulty. Loading requirements provide even greater problems when formulating dosage forms that are to be administered a limited number of times per day, such as for once-a-day dosing. Size problems are exacerbated when not all of the drug composition is released from the delivery device, since overloading of the drug, i.e. providing a quantity in the delivery device greater than that which will be released to the subject to provide the desired pharmacological effect, is necessary to ensure that an appropriate quantity of drug is made available to the subject.</p><p num="p0034">Dosage forms of this invention release effective amounts of active agent to the patient over a prolonged period of time and often provide the opportunity for less frequent dosing, including once-a-day dosing, than previously required for immediate release compositions. The dosage forms of this invention comprise a composition containing an active agent, wherein the composition is externally coated with a flow-promoting layer.</p><p num="p0035">Active agents include, <i>inter allia,</i> foods, food supplements, nutrients, drugs, antacids, vitamins, microorganism attenuators and other agents that benefit the environment of use.

The dosage form typically may include a carrier, e.g., hydrophilic polymer, in a composition with the active agent.</p><p num="p0039">With reference to Figure 1A, a preferred embodiment of a dosage form 1 of this invention having the "push-stick" configuration is illustrated prior to its administration to a subject. The dosage form 1 comprises a wall 2 defining a cavity 3. Wall 2 is provided with an exit orifice 4. Within cavity 3 and remote from the exit orifice 4 is a push layer 5. A drug layer 6 is located within cavity 3 adjacent exit orifice 4. In accordance with the invention, a flow-promoting layer 7, the function of which will be described and which may be formed as a secondary wall, extends between drug layer 6 and the inner surface of wall 2.</p><p num="p0040">The wall 2 is formed to be permeable to the passage of an external fluid, such as water and biological fluids, and it is substantially impermeable to the passage of active agent, osmagent, osmopolymer and the like. As such, it is semipermeable. The selectively semipermeable compositions used for forming the wall are essentially nonerodible and they are insoluble in biological fluids during the life of the dosage form. Wall 2 need not be semipermeable in its entirety. But at least a portion of wall 2 should be<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> semipermeable to allow fluid to contact or communicate with push layer 5 such that push layer 5 imbibes fluid during use. Specific materials for the fabrication of semipermeable wall 2 are well known in the art, and representative examples of such materials are described later herein.</p><p num="p0041">Secondary wall 7, which functions as the flow-promoting layer, is in contacting position with the inner surface of the semipermeable wall 2 and at least the external surface of the drug layer that is opposite wall 2; although the secondary wall 7 may, and preferably will, extend to, surround and contact the external surface of the push layer. Wall 7 typically will surround at least that portion of the external surface of the drug layer that is opposite the internal surface of wall 2. Secondary wall 7 may be formed as a coating applied over the compressed core comprising the drug layer and the push layer. The outer semipermeable wall 2 surrounds and encases the inner, secondary wall 7. Secondary wall 7 is preferably formed as a subcoat of at least the surface of the drug layer 6, and optionally the entire external surface of the compacted drug layer 6 and the push layer 5. When the semipermeable wall 2 is formed as a coat of the composite formed from the drug layer 6, the push layer 5 and the secondary wall 7, contact of the semipermeable wall 2 with the inner coat is assured.</p><p num="p0042">Secondary wall 7 facilitates release of drug from the dosage forms of the invention. In dosage forms in which there is high drug loading, i.e., 20% or greater, but more generally 40% or greater, active agent in the drug layer based on the overall weight of the drug layer, and no secondary wall, it has been observed that significant residual amounts of drug may remain in the device after the period of delivery has been completed. In some instances, residual drug amounts of greater that 20%, and even greater than 30%, by weight of the initial drug loading in the dosage form may remain in the dosage form at the end of a twenty-four hour period when tested in a release rate assay. A comparison of the release of nefazodone hydrochloride from a representative dosage form of this invention having a flow promoting layer and a dosage form not having the flow promoting layer (the details of which<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> are provided in EXAMPLE 8) is shown in Figures 13A-13 D for a dosage form having a drug loading of 83% (400 mg of nefazodone hydrochloride). Figures 13A and 13B are representative of the dosage form of the invention having a flow promoting layer and Figures 13C and 13D are representative of a similar dosage form without the flow promoting layer. The significant difference in the average, instantaneous release rates and the cumulative release rates for the two dosage forms is apparent. Additionally, it is apparent that after 24 hours there is significantly more drug remaining in the dosage form without the flow promoting layer than drug remaining in the dosage form having the flow promoting layer.</p><p num="p0043">As noted above, the amount of residual drug may be advantageously reduced by the addition of secondary wall 7 formed as an inner coat of a flow-promoting agent, i.e., an agent that lowers the frictional force between the outer, semi-permeable membrane wall 2 and the external surface of the drug layer 6. The secondary wall or inner coat 7 reduces the frictional forces between the semipermeable wall 2 and the outer surface of the drug layer, thus allowing for more complete delivery of drug from the device. Particularly in the case of active compounds having a high cost, such an improvement presents substantial economic advantages since it is not necessary to load the drug layer with an excess of drug to insure that the minimal amount of drug required will be delivered.</p><p num="p0044">The inner subcoat 7 typically may be 0.01 to 5 mm thick, more typically 0.5 to 5mm thick, and it comprises a member selected from hydrogels, gelatin, low molecular weight polyethylene oxides, e.g., less than 100,000 MW, hydroxyalkylcelluloses, e.g., hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyisopropylcelluose, hydroxybutylcellulose and hydroxyphenylcellulose, and hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses, e.g., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and mixtures thereof. The hydroxyalkylcelluloses comprises polymers having a 9,500 to 1,250,000 number-average molecular weight. For example, hydroxypropyl celluloses having number average molecular weights of between 80,000 to 850,000 are useful. The flow<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> promoting layer may be prepared from conventional solutions or suspensions of the aforementioned materials in aqueous solvents or inert organic solvents. Preferred materials for the subcoat or flow promoting layer include hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone [poly(vinylpyrrolidone)], polyethylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. More preferred are mixtures of hydroxypropyl cellulose and povidone, prepared in organic solvents, particularly organic polar solvents such as lower alkanols having 1-8 carbon atoms, preferably ethanol, mixtures of hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose prepared in aqueous solution, and mixtures of hydroxyethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol prepared in aqueous solution. Most preferably, the subcoat consists of a mixture of hydroxypropyl cellulose and povidone prepared in ethanol. Conveniently, the weight of the subcoat applied to the bilayer core may be correlated with the thickness of the subcoat and residual drug remaining in a dosage form in a release rate assay such as described herein. During manufacturing operations, the thickness of the subcoat may be controlled by controlling the weight of the subcoat taken up in the coating operation. When the secondary wall 7 is formed as a subcoat, i.e., by coating onto the tableted bilayer composite drug layer and push layer, the subcoat can fill in surface irregularities formed on the bilayer core by the tableting process. The resulting smooth external surface facilitates slippage between the coated bilayer composite and the semipermeable wall during dispensing of the drug, resulting in a lower amount of residual drug composition remaining in the device at the end of the dosing period. When wall 7 is fabricated of a gel-forming material, contact with water in the environment of use facilitates formation of a gel or gel-like inner coat having a viscosity that may promote and enhance slippage between outer wall 2 and drug layer 6.</p><p num="p0045">Representative polymers for forming wall 2 comprise semipermeable homopolymers, semipermeable copolymers, and the like. Such materials comprise cellulose esters, cellulose ethers and cellulose ester-ethers. The<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> cellulosic polymers have a degree of substitution (DS) of their anhydroglucose unit of from greater than 0 up to 3, inclusive. Degree of substitution (DS) means the average number of hydroxyl groups originally present on the anhydroglucose unit that are replaced by a substituting group or converted into another group. The anhydroglucose unit can be partially or completely substituted with groups such as acyl, alkanoyl, alkenoyl, aroyl, alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, carboalkyl, alkylcarbamate, alkylcarbonate, alkylsulfonate, alkysulfamate, semipermeable polymer forming groups, and the like, wherein the organic moieties contain from one to twelve carbon atoms, and preferably from one to eight carbon atoms.</p><p num="p0046">The semipermeable compositions typically include a member selected from the group consisting of cellulose acylate, cellulose diacylate, cellulose triacylate, cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, mono-, di- and tri-cellulose alkanylates, mono-, di-, and tri-alkenylates, mono-, di-, and tri-aroylates, and the like.

In the pan coating system, the subcoat of the wall-forming compositions is deposited by successive spraying of the respective composition on the bilayered core comprising the drug layer and the push layer accompanied by tumbling in a rotating pan. A pan coater is used because of its availability at commercial scale. Other techniques can be used for coating the drug core. The coated dosage form may be dried in a forced-air oven, or in a temperature and humidity controlled oven to free the dosage form of solvent. Drying conditions will be conventionally chosen on the basis of available equipment, ambient conditions, solvents, coatings, coating thickness, and the like.</p><p num="p0059">Other coating techniques can also be employed. For example, the semipermeable wall and the subcoat of the dosage form can be formed in one technique using the air-suspension procedure. This procedure consists of suspending and tumbling the bilayer core in a current of air, an inner subcoat composition and an outer semipermeable wall forming composition, until, in either operation, the subcoat and the outer wall coat is applied to the bilayer core. The air-suspension procedure is well suited for independently forming the wall of the dosage form. The air-suspension procedure is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,799,241; in <u style="single">J. Am.

An Aeromatic® air-suspension coater can be used employing a cosolvent.</p><p num="p0060">The dosage form of the invention may be manufactured by standard techniques. For example, the dosage form may be manufactured by the wet granulation technique. In the wet granulation technique, the drug and the ingredients comprising the first layer or drug composition are blended using an organic solvent, such as denatured anhydrous ethanol, as the granulation fluid. The ingredients forming the first layer or drug composition are individually passed through a preselected screen and then thoroughly<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> blended in a mixer. Next, other ingredients comprising the first layer can be dissolved in a portion of the granulation fluid, such as the solvent described above. Then, the latter prepared wet blend is slowly added to the drug blend with continual mixing in the blender. The granulating fluid is added until a wet blend is produced, which wet mass blend is then forced through a predetermined screen onto oven trays. The blend is dried for 18 to 24 hours at 24 C to 35 C in a forced-air oven. The dried granules are then sized. Next, magnesium stearate is added to the drug granulation, then put into milling jars and mixed on a jar mill for 10 minutes. The composition is pressed into a layer, for example, in a Manesty® press. The speed of the press is set at 20 rpm and the maximum load set at 2 tons. The first layer is pressed against the composition forming the second layer and the bilayer tablets are fed to the Kilian® Dry Coater press and surrounded with the drug-free coat, followed by the exterior wall solvent coating.</p><p num="p0061">In another manufacture the beneficial drug and other ingredients comprising the first layer facing the exit means are blended and pressed into a solid layer. The layer possesses dimensions that correspond to the internal dimensions of the area the layer is to occupy in the dosage form, and it also possesses dimensions corresponding to the second layer for forming a contacting arrangement therewith. The drug and other ingredients can also be blended with a solvent and mixed into a solid or semisolid form by conventional methods, such as ballmilling, calendering, stirring or rollmilling, and then pressed into a preselected shape. Next, the expandable layer, e.g., a layer of osmopolymer composition, is placed in contact with the layer of drug in a like manner. The layering of the drug formulation and the osmopolymer layer can be fabricated by conventional two-layer press techniques. The two contacted layers are first coated with the flow-promoting subcoat and then an outer semipermeable wall.

After the powdered ingredients are dry blended in the granulator, a granulating fluid, for example, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) in water, is sprayed onto the powders. The coated powders are then dried in the granulator. This process granulates all the ingredients present therein while adding the granulating fluid. After the granules are dried, a lubricant, such as stearic acid or magnesium stearate, is mixed into the granulation using a tote or V-blender. The granules are then pressed in the manner described above.</p><p num="p0063">The dosage form of the invention is provided with at least one exit orifice. The exit orifice cooperates with the drug core for the uniform release of drug from the dosage form.

The expression "exit orifice" as used for the purpose of this invention includes a member selected from the group consisting of a passageway; an aperture; an orifice; and a bore. The expression also includes an orifice that is formed from a substance or polymer that erodes, dissolves or is leached from the outer coat or wall or inner coat to form an exit orifice. The substance or polymer may include an erodible poly(glycolic) acid or poly(lactic) acid in the outer or inner coats; a gelatinous filament; a water-removable poly(vinyl alcohol); a leachable compound, such as a fluid removable pore-former selected from the group consisting of inorganic and organic salt, oxide and carbohydrate. An exit, or a plurality of exits, can be formed by leaching a member selected from the group consisting of sorbitol, lactose, fructose, glucose, mannose, galactose, talose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium citrate and mannitol to provide a uniform-release dimensioned pore-exit orifice. The exit orifice can have any shape, such as round, triangular, square, elliptical and the like for<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> the uniform metered dose release of a drug from the dosage form. The dosage form can be constructed with one or more exits in spaced apart relation or one or more surfaces of the dosage form.
