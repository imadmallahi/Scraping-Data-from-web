cracking of hydrocarbon oils in the absence of hydrogen, and
specifically relates to a process for catalytic cracking of
petroleum hydrocarbon stocks in the absence of hydrogen to
increase simultaneously the yields of diesel oil and liquefied
gas.</p><p num="0002">Liquefied gas is one of the important petrochemical
products, of which light olefins are important chemical raw
materials of high commercial value. Diesel oil has high heat
efficiency and the exhaust tail gas from vehicles running on
diesel oil contains less harmful constituents, so it meets
the more and more rigorous requirements for environmental
protection all over the world. Thus, following the increase
in the number of vehicles running on diesel oil, the market
demand for diesel oils is also growing.</p><p num="0003">Diesel oil comes mainly from fraction oils produced by the
primary and secondary processing of crude oil. In the primary
processing, i.e. the atmospheric and vacuum distillation, the
yield of diesel fractions from crude oil is fixed, so no
potential can be tapped. In the secondary processing,
catalytic cracking is usually adopted for producing diesel
oil. Featuring large-volume treatment and flexible operation
conditions, this process of catalytic cracking is an important
means for improving the yields of liquefied gas and diesel
oil.</p><p num="0004">CN1031834A discloses a catalytic cracking process for
producing more light olefins. Although this process can
produce large quantities of liquefied gas, but its yield of
diesel oil is relatively low, generally lees than 10wt%, and
moreover it requires a special catalyst and processing unit.</p><p num="0005">CN10858B5A discloses a method for obtaining higher yields
of liquefied gas and gasoline under the following reaction
conditions: a reaction temperature of 480°-550°C, a preasure
of 130-350KPa, a WHSV of 1-150h<sup>-1</sup>, a catalyst/oil ratio of 4-15, 
and a steam/hydrocarbon stock weight ratio of 0.05-0.12:1.
The yield of liquefied gas in the reaction products is 30-40wt%,
but that of diesel oil is comparatively low.</p><p num="0006">CN1160746A discloses a catalytic cracking process for
raising the octane number of low-grade gasoline fractions,
wherein a low-grade gasoline is introduced into a riser reactor
through its lower part and the reaction is curried out under
the conditions of a reaction temperature of 600°-730°C, a WHSV
of 1-180h<sup>-1</sup>, and catalyst/oil ratio of 6-180, then a high octane
gasoline is mainly obtained. The feedstocks employed in this
process are low-grade gasolines, such as straight-run gasoline,
coker gasoline and so on, and the yields of liquefied gas and
diesel oil in the reaction products are 24-39wt% and 0.5-2.3wt%
respectively.</p><p num="0007">USP3, 784, 463 discloses a process carried out in a reaction
system comprising at least two riser reactors, wherein a
low-grade gasoline is introduced into one of the riser reactors
and catalytic cracking reaction occurs. By this process, the
gasoline octane number and yield of liquefied gas are improved.
However, this process cannot give higher yield of diesel oil,
and it requires that the reaction unit should be revamped by
adding at least another riser.</p><p num="0008">USP5,846,403 discloses a process of recracking of
catalytic naphtha to obtain a maximum yield of light olefins.
The process is carried out in a riser reactor comprising two
reaction zones, namely an upstream reaction zone in the lower
part of the reactor and a downstream reaction zone in the upper
part. In the upstream reaction zone, the feedstock is a light
catalytic naphtha (having a boiling point below 140°C), and
the reaction conditions are: an oil-catalyst contact
temperature of 620°-775°C, an oil and gas residence time of
less than 1.5 sec., a catalyst/oil ratio of 75-150, and the
proportion of steam accounting for 2-50wt% the weight of
naphtha, while in the downstream reaction zone, the feedstock
is a conventional catalytic cracking stock (having a boiling
point of 220°-575°C) , and the reaction conditions are: a
temperature of 600°-750°C and an oil and gas residence time
of less than 20 sec. Compared with conventional catalytic
cracking, the yields of liquefied gas and light cycle oil (i.e.
diesel oil) of this process increase by 0.97-1.21 percentage
points and 0.13-0.31 percentage points higher. </p><p num="0009">CN1034949A discloses a process for converting petroleum
hydrocarbons in which the stocks, ethane, gasoline, catalytic
cracking stock and cycle oil, are successively upwardly
introduced into a riser reactor through its lowermost part.
This process is mainly aimed at producing light olefins, but
the total yield of gasoline, diesel oil and liquefied gas
decreases.</p><p num="0010">EP0369536A1 disclosed a process for catalytic cracking
hydrocarbon feedstock, in which a hydrocarbon feedstock is
charged into the lower part of the riser reactor wherein said
hydrocarbon feedstock is admixed with freshly regenerated
cracking catalyst, and a recycle portion of a light liquid
hydrocarbon stream is charged into the riser zone at a level
above the hydrocarbon feedstock charging level. This process
operates in such a manner to produce maximum quantities of
fuel oil, or alternatively to produce maximum quantities of
olefins in different conditions, but can't increase the yields
of diesel oil and of olefins simultaneously.</p><p num="0011">US P4,422,925 discloses a process for fluidized catalytic
cracking hydrocarbon feedstock for producing gaseous olefins,
which comprises charging gaseous C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>3</sub> rich stock into the
lowermost portion of the riser reaction zone to contact with
hot freshly regenerated catalyst and charging heavy
hydrocarbon stock to an upper section, of the riser, and
introducing naphtha or gas oil into a section between said
lower and upper sections of said riser. This process can
produce high yield of light olefins but the increment of yield
of diesel oil is very small.</p><p num="0012">US P3894932 disclosed a method for converting hydrocarbons
which comprises passing C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> gaseous hydrocarbon fraction
through a lower portion of a riser, introducing gas oil at
one or more spaced apart downstream intervals, and introducing
C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbon or isobutylene or gas oil through the upper
portion of the riser. This method is aimed at producing
aromatics and isobutane but can't increase the yields of diesel
oil and liquefied gas simultaneously.</p><p num="0013">Another method of increasing the yield of liquefied gas
is by adding a catalyst promoter to the catalytic cracking
catalyst. For example, USP4,309,280 discloses a method of
adding a HZSM-5 zeolite in an amount of 0.01-1% by weight of 
the catalyst directly into the catalytic cracking unit.</p><p num="0014">USP3, 758, 403 discolses a catalyst comprising ZSM-5 zeolite
and large-pore zeolite (e.g. the Y-type and X-type) (in a ratio
of 1:10-3:1) as active components, thereby raising the yield
of liquefied gas and the gasoline octane number by a big margin,
while the yields of propene and butene are increased by about
10wt%. Furthermore, CN1004878B, USP4,980,053 and CN1043520A
have disclosed catalysts comprising mixtures of ZSM-5 zeolite
and Y-type zeolite as active components, resulting in that
remarkable increases in the yield of liquefied gas are achieved.
However, this kind of methods is used to mainly increase the
yield of liquefied gas by means of modifying the catalysts,
while the increase in the yield of diesel oil is less.</p><p num="0015">The above-mentioned patented processes can only increase
the yield of liquefied gas, but cannot increase the yield of
diesel simultaneously, or if any, the yield of diesel oil is
insignificant. Moreover, some of the above-mentioned patented
processes require special catalysts or reaction units, or the
existing units should be largely refitted to meet their
specific requirements.</p><p num="0016">The object of the present invention is to provide a
catalytic cracking process for increasing the yields of diesel
oil and liquefied gas simultaneously on the basis of the prior
art.</p><heading><u style="single">Summary of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0017">The present invention relates to a process for catalytic

   Among them said gasoline stock used in the gasoline
cracking zone is a distillate oil having a boiling range of
30°-210°C selected from straight-run gasoline, catalytic
gasoline and coker gasoline, or mixtures thereof, preferably
a catalytic gasoline fraction having C<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup>-205°C; and it can also
be a narrow fraction of gasoline of a certain stage, such as
that having a boiling range of 90°-140°C or 110°-210°C. Said
gasoline stock may be fractions obtained from the present
reaction unit per se or from other sources. Said pre-lifting
medium is a dry gas or steam. The weight ratio of said
pre-lifting medium to gasoline stock is in the range of 0-5:1.</p><p num="0021">In the gasoline cracking zone, the reaction temperature
is about 500°-700°C, preferably about 620°-680°C; the reaction
pressure is from atmospheric pressure to 300 KPa, preferably
about 100-230 KPa; the residence time is about 0.1-3.0 sec,
preferably about 0.2-1.5 sec; the weight ratio of catalyst
to gasoline stock is about 10-150, preferably about 20-80;
the weight ratio of gasoline stock to conventional catalytic
cracking feed is about 0.02-0.50:1, preferably about 0.1-0.3:1;
and the regenerated catalyst has a temperature of about
600°-750°C, preferably about 660°-710°C.</p><p num="0022">Said gasoline stock may be introduced from the bottom of
the gasoline cracking zone or through spray nozzles arranged
around the gasoline cracking zone, wherein the gasoline stock
is cracked to form a liquefied gas and at the same time the
sulfur and olefin contents in the gasoline are reduced while
the gasoline octane number is raised. When hot catalyst comes
into contact with the gasoline stock, its temperature reduces
and simultaneously a trace of coke deposits on the catalyst,
hence diminishing the activity of the catalyst and passivating
the metals supported thereon, which is advantageous for
increasing the yield of diesel oil. When the catalyst in this 
state contacts the conventional catalytic cracking feeds in
the heavy oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone, more
diesel oil is produced. The resultant oil-gas mixture and
reacted catalyst from the gasoline-cracking zone enter the
heavy oil-cracking zone directly.</p><p num="0023">The conventional catalytic cracking feeds used in the heavy
oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone are selected
at least one from straight-run gas oils, coker gas oils,
deasphalted oils, hydrofined oils, hrdrogracking tail oils,
vacuum residues and atmospheric residues, or mixtures thereof.
Said conventional catalytic cracking feed used in steps (b)
and (C) may the same or different. A portion of about 20-95wt%
of said conventional catalytic cracking feed solely,
or mixed with slurry and/or heavy cycle oil, is charged into
the heavy oil cracking zone; and a portion of about 5-80wt%
of said conventional catalytic cracking feed solely, or mixed
with slurry and/or heavy cycle oil, is charged into the light
oil cracking zone.</p><p num="0024">The function of heavy oil cracking zone is to control the
cracking reaction of gasoline stock, to enhance the level of
heavy oil cracking severity and to ensure the conversion of
heavy oil fractions so as to increase the yield of diesel oil
from the feedstock in the heavy oil cracking zone and improve
the feedstock's selectivity to diesel oil in the light oil
cracking zone. In the heavy oil cracking zone, the weight ratio
of catalyst to feedstock is about 5-20, preferably about 7-15;
the oil-gas mixture residence time is about 0.1-2 sec.,
preferably about 0.3-1.0 sec.; and the reaction pressure is
from atmospheric pressure to 300 KPa, preferably about 100-230
KPa. The portion of feedstock to be processed in the heavy
oil cracking zone is relatively heavier and more difficult
to be cracked.</p><p num="0025">The function of light oil cracking zone is to carry out
cracking of the conventional catalytic cracking feed in this
zone under an environment formed through the controlling
processes of the gasoline cracking zone and heavy oil cracking
zone, which is beneficial for improving the feedstocks'
selectivity to diesel oil in the heavy oil cracking zone and
light oil cracking zone. In the light oil cracking zone, the
weight ratio of catalyst to feedstock is about 3-15, preferably
about 5-10; the oil-gas mixture residence time is about 0.1-6 
sec., preferably about 0.3-3 sec.; and the reaction pressure
is from atmospheric pressure to 300 KPa, preferably about
100-230 KPa. The portion of feedstock to be processed in the
light oil cracking zone is relatively lighter and easier to
be cracked.</p><p num="0026">The recracking of heavy cycle oil and slurry is to convert
unreacted fractions of them into valuable light oil products.</p><p num="0027">A termination reaction zone can be arranged after the light
oil cracking zone. The function of the termination reaction
zone is to diminish secondary cracking of light oils from the
heavy oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone, to
increase the yield of diesel oil and to control the degree
of conversion of the catalytic stocks as a whole. Said reaction
terminating medium is selected at least one from waste water,
softened water, recycle oils, heavy oil fractions, coker gas
oils, deasphalted oils, straight-run gas oils and
hydrocracking tail oils, or mixtures thereof. Depending on
the type of reaction terminating medium used and the operation
parameters in the heavy oil cracking zone and light oil
cracking zone, particularly that of the light oil cracking
zone, the weight ratio of reaction terminating medium to
conventional catalytic cracking feed is about 0-30wt%.
Controlled by the quantity of terminating medium injected,
the temperature in the reaction termination zone is in the
range of about 470°-550°C, and the material residence time is
about 0.2-3.0 sec.</p><p num="0028">The catalyst applicable in the process according to the
present invention can be one comprising at least one active
component selected from Y-type or HY-type zeolites with or
without rare earth, ultra-stable Y-type zeolites with or
without rare earth, zeolites of ZSM-5 series, or high-silica
zeolites having pentatomic ring structure and β -zeolites, or
mixtures thereof, and can also be an amorphous silica-alumina
catalyst. In short, all the catalytic cracking catalysts can
be applied in the process according to the present invention.</p><p num="0029">Said riser or fluidized bed reactor comprising a gasoline
cracking zone, a heavy oil cracking zone, a light oil cracking
zone and a termination reaction zone has a total height of
10-50 m, wherein the heights of the zones account for 2-20%, 
2-40%, 2-60% and 0-40% respectively; more accurately, the
height of each of the four zones is determined in accordance
with the specific operating parameters required in each
reaction zone.</p><p num="0030">The process according to the present invention can be
carried out in conventional catalytic cracking reactors.
However, since the gasoline cracking zone in certain existing
catalytic cracking units is to long, it has to be refitted,
for example, the feed inlet in the gasoline cracking zone has
to be rearranged at a higher location. The present process
can also be carried out in reactors with a gasoline cracking
zone of different structures.</p><p num="0031">The process of the present invention is further illustrated
with reference to the attached drawing (exemplified with riser
reactor).</p><p num="0032">The flow scheme shows the catalytic cracking process for
higher yields of both diesel oil and liquefied gas, but the
shape and dimensions of the riser reactor are not restricted
to what is shown in the schematic diagram, whereas they are
determined by the specific conditions of operation.

   The flow scheme of the process according to the present
invention is as follows:
<sl><li>A gasoline stock and a pre-lifting medium from pipelines
1 and 2 respectively are charged in a preset ratio into the
riser reactor 3 through a location at a height of 0-80% of
the gasoline cracking zone I contact a catalyst, which is a
fresh one or a regenerated one, and then the resultant oil-gas
mixture and reacted catalyst rise up and enter the heavy oil
cracking zone II; a portion of conventional catalytic cracking
feed solely from pipeline 13, or mixed with a recycling slurry
from pipeline 16 and/or heavy cycle oil from pipeline 17, is
charged into the reactor via pipeline 13 through the bottom
of the heavy oil cracking zone II contacts the reactant oil-gas
mixture and catalyst rising from the gasoline cracking zone,
and then the resultant oil-gas mixture and reacted catalyst
rise up and enter the light oil cracking zone III; another
portion of conventional catalytic cracking feed solely from
pipeline 14, or mixed with a recycling slurry from pipelines
16 and 18 and /or heavy cycle oil from pipelines 17 and 19,
is charged into the reactor via pipeline 14 through the bottom 
of the light oil cracking zone contacts the reactant oil-gas
mixture and catalyst rising from the heavy oil cracking
zone, and then the resultant oil-gas mixture and reacted
catalyst rise up and enter the termination reaction zone IV;
optionally, a reaction terminating medium from pipeline 15
is charged into the reactor through the bottom of the
termination reaction zone IV, from which the reactant oil-gas
mixture and spent catalyst flow into the disengaging section
4 with or without a dense fluidized bed reactor, and then the
oil-gas mixture and steam via pipeline 11 enter the
fractionation system 12 and are separated into dry gas,
liquefied gas, gasoline, diesel oil, heavy cycle oil and slurry,
and then the slurry can be circulated back to the heavy oil
cracking zone via pipelines 16 and 13 in sequence, or to the
light oil cracking zone via pipelines 16, 18 and 14 in sequence;
and the heavy cycle oil can be circulatad back to the heavy
oil cracking zone via pipelines 17 and 13 in sequence, or to
the light oil cracking zone via pipelines 17, 19 and 14 in
sequence. The spent catalyst enters the steam stripper 5 for
steam stripping, and then enters the regenerator 7 via the
slant pipe 6 to undergo coke-burning and regeneration in the
presence of air; the air is introduced into the regenerator
7 via pipeline 9, and flue gas is discharged therefrom via
pipeline 10, and the hot regenerated catalyst is circulated
back to the bottom of the gasoline cracking zone of the riser
reactor for reuse.</li></sl></p><p num="0033">The advantages of the present invention are embodied in
the following points:
<sl><li>1. The process of the present invention can be carried out
in an existing conventional catalytic cracking unit, which
need not to be revamped in large scale, and it does not require
special catalyst either, while the yields of liquefied gas
and diesel oil can be increased by a big margin;</li><li>2. In the gasoline cracking zone, when the gasoline stock
and hot catalyst comes into contact, a trace of coke deposited
on the catalyst will cause passivation of the metals supported
on the catalyst, hence reducing the adverse effects of the
metals on product distribution. Since a large portion of strong
acid sites on the zeolite and the matrix are covered by the
trace of coke, this is beneficial for inhibiting coke-forming
tendency during cracking of conventional catalytic cracking 
feed as well as for improving the selectivity to diesel oil;</li><li>3. In respect of the portion of relatively light fractions
in the feedstock which can be easily cracked, the measures
of operating at lower temperature with less rigorous reaction
severity, shorter contact cracking and preventing secondary
cracking can effectively improve the selectivity to diesel
oil;</li><li>4. As sulfur contained in the gasoline stock is mainly
distributed in the heavy components, the reaction in the
gasoline cracking zone of the riser reactor occurs to crack
selectively the heavy components therein, thus the sulfur
content can be reduced remarkably,</li><li>5. In the process according to the present invention, the
gasoline stock injected into the reactor can substitute
completely or partially for the pre-lifting steam, as a result,
the energy consumption of the reaction unit and waste water
discharged therefrom are reduced, so this is beneficial for
environment protection as well as for diminishing hydrothermal
deactivation of the catalyst; and</li><li>6. The gasoline octane number can be maintained at a higher
level or raised, while olefins of gasoline can be reduced.</li></sl></p><heading><u style="single">Examples</u></heading><p num="0034">The process of the present invention is further illustrated
