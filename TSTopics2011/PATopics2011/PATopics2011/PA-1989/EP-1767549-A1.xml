The use of Ziegler-Natta catalysts, for example, those catalysts produced by activating titanium halides with organometallic compounds such as triethylaluminium, is fundamental to many commercial processes for manufacturing polyolefins. Over the last three decades, advances in the technology have led to the development of Ziegler-Natta catalysts which have such high activities that olefin polymers and copolymers containing very low concentrations of residual catalyst can be produced directly in commercial polymerisation processes. The quantities of residual catalyst remaining in the produced polymer are so small as to render unnecessary their separation and removal for most commercial applications. Such processes can be operated by polymerising the monomers in the gas phase, or in solution or in suspension in a liquid hydrocarbon diluent, or, in the case of propylene, in bulk.</p><p num="p0003">Commodity polyethylenes are commercially produced in a variety of different types and grades. Homopolymerisation of ethylene with transition metal based catalysts leads to the production of so-called "high density" grades of polyethylene. These polymers have relatively high stiffness and are useful for making articles where inherent rigidity is required. Copolymerisation of ethylene with higher 1-olefins (eg butene, hexene or octene) is employed commercially to provide a wide variety of copolymers differing in density and in other important physical properties. Particularly important copolymers made by copolymerising ethylene with higher 1-olefins using transition metal based catalysts are the copolymers having a density in the range of 0.91 to 0.93. These copolymers which are generally referred to in the art as "linear low density polyethylene" are in many respects similar to the so-called "low density" polyethylene produced by the high pressure free radical catalysed polymerisation of ethylene. Such polymers and copolymers are used extensively in the manufacture of flexible blown film.</p><p num="p0004">Polypropylenes are also commercially produced in a variety of different types and grades. Homopolymerisation of propylene with transition metal based catalysts leads to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> production of grades with a wide variety of applications. Copolymers of propylene with ethylene or terpolymers with ethylene and higher 1-olefins are also useful materials.</p><p num="p0005">In recent years the use of certain metallocene compounds as catalysts (for example biscyclopentadienylzirconiumdichloride activated with alumoxane) has provided potentially high activity in the polymerisation of olefins. Other derivatives of metallocenes have been shown to be potentially useful for producing polypropylene with good activity, molecular weight and tacticity control. However, metallocene catalysts of this type suffer from a number of disadvantages, for example, high sensitivity to impurities when used with commercially available monomers, diluents and process gas streams, the need to use large quantities of expensive alumoxanes to achieve high activity, difficulties in putting the catalyst on to a suitable support and synthetic difficulties in the production of more complex catalyst structures suitable for polymerising propylene in a tactic manner.</p><p num="p0006"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP0950667A" status="new"><text>EP0950667</text></patcit> discloses a wide variety of non-metallocene transition metal-based complexes for use as catalysts in polymerising olefins.

The catalyst or catalyst system of the present invention can also used in conjunction with other catalysts producing only 1-olefins, either inside or outside the polymerisation reactor, and in this way make copolymers of ethylene or propylene and these 1-olefins.

If desired, the catalyst can be used to polymerise ethylene under high pressure/high temperature process conditions wherein the polymeric material forms as a melt in supercritical ethylene. Preferably the polymerisation is conducted under gas phase fluidised or stirred bed conditions.</p><p num="p0042">Slurry phase polymerisation conditions or gas phase polymerisation conditions are particularly useful for the production of high-density grades of polyethylene. In these processes the polymerisation conditions can be batch, continuous or semi-continuous. In the slurry phase process and the gas phase process, the catalyst is generally fed to the polymerisation zone in the form of a particulate solid. This solid can be, for example, an undiluted solid catalyst system formed from the complex of Formula A or B and an<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> activator, or can be the solid complex alone. In the latter situation, the activator can be fed to the polymerisation zone, for example as a solution, separately from or together with the solid complex. Preferably the catalyst system or the transition metal complex component of the catalyst system employed in the slurry polymerisation and gas phase polymerisation is supported on a support material. Most preferably the catalyst system is supported on a support material prior to its introduction into the polymerisation zone. Suitable support materials are, for example, magnesium chloride, silica, alumina, zirconia, talc, kieselguhr, or magnesia. Impregnation of the support material can be carried out by conventional techniques, for example, by forming a solution or suspension of the catalyst components in a suitable diluent or solvent, and slurrying the support material therewith. The support material thus impregnated with catalyst can then be separated from the diluent for example, by filtration or evaporation techniques.</p><p num="p0043">In the slurry phase polymerisation process the solid particles of catalyst, or supported catalyst, are fed to a polymerisation zone either as dry powder or as a slurry in the polymerisation diluent. Preferably the particles are fed to a polymerisation zone as a suspension in the polymerisation diluent. The polymerisation zone can be, for example, an autoclave or similar reaction vessel, or a continuous loop reactor, eg of the type well know in the manufacture of polyethylene by the Phillips Process. When the polymerisation process of the present invention is carried out under slurry conditions the polymerisation is preferably carried out at a temperature above 0¬∞C, most preferably above 15¬∞C. The polymerisation temperature is preferably maintained below the temperature at which the polymer commences to soften or sinter in the presence of the polymerisation diluent. If the temperature is allowed to go above the latter temperature, fouling of the reactor can occur. Adjustment of the polymerisation within these defined temperature ranges can provide a useful means of controlling the average molecular weight of the produced polymer. A further useful means of controlling the molecular weight is to conduct the polymerisation in the presence of hydrogen gas which acts as chain transfer agent. Generally, the higher the concentration of hydrogen employed, the lower the average molecular weight of the produced polymer.</p><p num="p0044">A problem that can occur in the gas and slurry phase polymerisation of olefins is that of fouling of the reactor walls, any stirrer that may be present and spalling or<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> agglomeration of the polymer due, for example, to the presence of static electricity. The problem can be reduced or eliminated by judicious use of suitable antistatic agents. One example of a family of antistatic agents suitable for use in the polymerisation of olefins are commercially available under the trade name "STADIS".</p><p num="p0045">The use of hydrogen gas as a means of controlling the average molecular weight of the polymer or copolymer applies generally to the polymerisation process of the present invention. For example, hydrogen can be used to reduce the average molecular weight of polymers or copolymers prepared using gas phase, slurry phase or solution phase polymerisation conditions. The quantity of hydrogen gas to be employed to give the desired average molecular weight can be determined by simple "trial and error" polymerisation tests.</p><p num="p0046">Methods for operating gas phase polymerisation processes are well known in the art. Such methods generally involve agitating (e.g. by stirring, vibrating or fluidising) a bed of catalyst, or a bed of the target polymer (i.e. polymer having the same or similar physical properties to that which it is desired to make in the polymerisation process) containing a catalyst, and feeding thereto a stream of monomer at least partially in the gaseous phase, under conditions such that at least part of the monomer polymerises in contact with the catalyst in the bed. The bed is generally cooled by the addition of cool gas (e.g. recycled gaseous monomer) and/or volatile liquid (e.g. a volatile inert hydrocarbon, or gaseous monomer which has been condensed to form a liquid). The polymer produced in, and isolated from, gas phase processes forms directly a solid in the polymerisation zone and is free from, or substantially free from liquid. As is well known to those skilled in the art, if any liquid is allowed to enter the polymerisation zone of a gas phase polymerisation process the quantity of liquid is small in relation to the quantity of polymer present in the polymerisation zone. This is in contrast to "solution phase" processes wherein the polymer is formed dissolved in a solvent, and "slurry phase" processes wherein the polymer forms as a suspension in a liquid diluent.</p><p num="p0047">The gas phase process can be operated under batch, semi-batch, or so-called "continuous" conditions. It is preferred to operate under conditions such that monomer is continuously recycled to an agitated polymerisation zone containing polymerisation catalyst, make-up monomer being provided to replace polymerised monomer, and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> continuously or intermittently withdrawing produced polymer from the polymerisation zone at a rate comparable to the rate of formation of the polymer, fresh catalyst being added to the polymerisation zone to replace the catalyst withdrawn form the polymerisation zone with the produced polymer.</p><p num="p0048">In the polymerisation process of the present invention the process conditions are preferably gas phase fluidised or stirred bed polymerisation conditions.</p><p num="p0049">When using the catalysts of the present invention under gas phase polymerisation conditions, the catalyst, or one or more of the components employed to form the catalyst can, for example, be introduced into the polymerisation reaction zone in liquid form, for example, as a solution in an inert liquid diluent. Thus, for example, the transition metal component, or the activator component, or both of these components can be dissolved or slurried in a liquid diluent and fed to the polymerisation zone. Under these circumstances it is preferred the liquid containing the component(s) is sprayed as fine droplets into the polymerisation zone. The droplet diameter is preferably within the range 1 to 1000 microns. <patcit id="pcit0011" dnum="EP0593083A" status="new"><text>EP-A-0593083</text></patcit>, the teaching of which is hereby incorporated into this specification, discloses a process for introducing a polymerisation catalyst into a gas phase polymerisation.

The polymerisation stirrer head was flame dried and then assembled under nitrogen in a glove box. Solvent (heptane - 200ml) was introduced <i>via</i> the gas line inlet direct from a solvent drying tower. Methylaluminoxane (4.0mmol supplied by Aldrich) and, when required, co-monomer were introduced <i>via</i> syringe prior to the addition of precatalyst (ie titanium complex). All precatalysts were generated <i>in situ</i> by the addition of the desired ligand to a solution of TiCl<sub>2</sub>(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in toluene and injected into the Fischer porter vessel immediately. Polymerisation was initiated by introducing ethylene gas at the required pressure to the stirred catalyst solution. The polymerisation runs were carried out for 30 minutes at 25¬∞C and were terminated by venting the vessel of ethylene and addition of MeOH/HCl (aq) solution. The isolated polymer products were recovered by filtration, washed with MeOH (20 ml) and dried to constant weight in a vacuum oven at 50 ¬∞C. The results are shown in Table 1 from which it can be seen that Runs 4 to 14, which are all in accordance with the present invention, have provided very high catalyst activity. The<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> Comparative Examples (1 and 4) are illustrated in Runs 1 to 3 and 15 to 17. These have given relatively low catalyst activities.
