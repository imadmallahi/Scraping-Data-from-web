<DP n="2"/>--><p num="p0001"> USE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS</p><p num="p0002">Aliskiren inhibits the action of the natural enzyme renin. The latter passes from the kidneys into the blood where it effects the cleavage of angiotensinogen, releasing the decapeptide angiotensin I which is then cleaved in the lungs, the kidneys and other organs to form the octapeptide angiotensinogen II. The octapeptide increases blood pressure both directly by arterial vasoconstriction and indirectly by liberating from the adrenal glands the sodium-ion- retaining hormone aldosterone, accompanied by an increase in extracellular fluid volume. That increase can be attributed to the action of aldosterone. Inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of renin bring about a reduction in the formation of angiotensin I. As a result a proportionately smaller amount of angiotensin II is produced. The reduced concentration of that active peptide hormone is the direct cause of, e.g., the hypotensive effect of renin inhibitors.</p><p num="p0003">Further evaluations revealed that renin inhibitors can be used for a broader range of therapeutic indications.</p><p num="p0004">The invention relates to a method for the prevention of, delay progression to overt to or treatment of a condition or disease selected from: (a) diabetes type 2 (associated with or without hypertension).

The term "synergistic", as used herein, means that the effect achieved with the methods and compositions of the present invention is greater than the sum of the effects that result from individual methods and compositions comprising the active ingredients of this invention separately.</p><p num="p0097">The person skilled in the pertinent art is fully enabled to select a relevant and standard animal test model to prove the hereinbefore and hereinafter indicated therapeutic indications and beneficial effects.</p><p num="p0098">These pharmaceutical preparations are for enteral, such as oral, and also rectal or parenteral, administration to homeotherms, with the preparations comprising the pharmacological active compound either alone or together with customary pharmaceutical auxiliary substances. For example, the pharmaceutical preparations consist of from about 0.1-90%, preferably of from about 1 % to about 80%, of the active compound. Pharmaceutical preparations for enteral or parenteral, and also for ocular, administration are, e.g., in unit dose forms, such as coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories and also ampoules. These are prepared in a manner that is known per se, e.g., using conventional mixing, granulation, coating, solubulizing or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compound with solid excipients, if desired granulating a mixture which has been obtained, and, if required or necessary, processing the mixture or granulate into tablets or coated tablet cores after having added suitable auxiliary substances.</p><p num="p0099">The dosage of the active compound can depend on a variety of factors, such as mode of administration, homeothermic species, age and/or individual condition.</p><p num="p0100">Preferred dosages for the active ingredients of the pharmaceutical combination according to the present invention are therapeutically effective dosages, especially those which are commercially-available.</p><p num="p0101">Normally, in the case of oral administration, an approximate daily dose of from about 1 mg to about 360 mg is to be estimated, e.g., for a patient of approximately 75 kg in weight.</p><p num="p0102">The dosage of the active compound can depend on a variety of factors, such as mode of administration, homeothermic species, age and/or individual condition.

Usually, children receive about half of the adult dose. The dose necessary for each individual can be monitored, e.g., by measuring the serum concentration of the active ingredient, and adjusted to an optimum level. Single doses comprise, e.g., 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg per adult patient.</p><p num="p0104">Valsartan, as a representative of the class of AT receptor antagonists, will be supplied in the form of suitable dosage unit form, e.g., a capsule or tablet, and comprising a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., from about 20 mg to about 320 mg, of valsartan which may be applied to patients. The application of the active ingredient may occur up to three times a day (t.i.d.), starting, e.g., with a daily dose of 20 mg or 40 mg of valsartan, increasing via 80 mg daily and further to 160 mg daily up to 320 mg daily. Preferably, valsartan is applied twice a day (b.i.d.) with a dose of 80 mg or 160 mg, respectively, each. Corresponding doses may be taken, e.g., in the morning, at mid-day or in the evening.
