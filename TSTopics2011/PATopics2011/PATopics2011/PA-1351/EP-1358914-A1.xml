characteristics, various improvements were made in the prior
art in formulating the polybutadiene used as the base rubber.</p><p num="0003">For example, USP 4,683,257 proposes a rubber
composition for use in solid golf balls, comprising a
polybutadiene having a Mooney viscosity of 70 to 100 and
synthesized using a nickel or cobalt catalyst, in admixture
with another polybutadiene having a Mooney viscosity of 30
to 90 and synthesized using a lanthanoid catalyst or
polybutadiene having a Mooney viscosity of 20 to 50 and
synthesized using a nickel or cobalt catalyst as the base

further improvements in workability during extrusion and
resilience.</p><p num="0005">USP 4,955,613 proposes golf balls prepared using a
blend of a polybutadiene having a Mooney viscosity of less
than 50 and synthesized with a Group VIII catalyst in
combination with a polybutadiene having a Mooney viscosity

However, the resulting golf balls have poor resilience

synthesized using a nickel or cobalt catalyst in combination
with a polybutadiene having a Mooney viscosity of 20 to 90 
and synthesized using a lanthanoid catalyst; USP 6,194,505
proposes a solid golf ball molded from a rubber composition
based on a rubber having a 1,2 vinyl content of at most 2.0%
and a weight-average molecular weight to number-average
molecular weight ratio Mw/Mn of not more than 3.5; USP
4,929,678 proposes a golf ball molded from a rubber

from a rubber composition comprising polybutadiene having a
high number-average molecular weight in admixture with
polybutadiene having a low number-average molecular weight.
However, all these proposals have drawbacks including
difficult working during extrusion and inferior resilience
characteristics of the resulting golf balls.</p><p num="0007">USP 4,546,980 describes use of two organic peroxides,
and USP 4,770,422 describes use of a minor amount of organic

insufficient resilience and a prolonged crosslinking time
causing a substantial lowering of productivity.</p><p num="0008">In general, polybutadienes synthesized using
rare-earth catalysts are believed to be highly resilient,
but leave a problem of extremely inefficient working.</p><p num="0009">In the prior art, studies for achieving effective
working are being made by varying the blend ratio of
different polybutadienes while there remains a problem that
a polybutadiene having ease of working is added at the
sacrifice of resilience.</p><p num="0010">For conventional polybutadienes synthesized using

which can be manufactured with ease of working due to
improved extrudability, is improved in productivity due to 
reduced vulcanization time, and exhibits good resilience
characteristics.</p><p num="0012">Making extensive investigations to achieve the above
object, the inventor has found that when a rubber
composition is formulated by using a base rubber composed
primarily of a polybutadiene containing at least 60% by
weight of cis-1,4-bond, having a Mooney viscosity (ML<sub>1+4</sub>
(100°C)) of at least 30, and synthesized using a rare-earth
catalyst, compounding 100 parts by weight of the base rubber
with 15 to 50 parts by weight of an unsaturated carboxylic
acid and/or a metal salt thereof, and at least 2 parts by
weight of a processing aid having a highest melting point of
up to 115°C, and further compounding therewith at least two
organic peroxides including an organic peroxide having the
shortest half-life at 155°C designated (a) and another
organic peroxide having the longest half-life at 155°C
designated (b), a ratio of half-lives (b<sub>t</sub>/a<sub>t</sub>) being at least
7 wherein a<sub>t</sub> is the half-life of (a) and b<sub>t</sub> is the half-life
of (b), in a total content of 0.1 to 0.9 part by weight per
100 parts by weight of the base rubber, a golf ball
comprising a molded and vulcanized product of the rubber
composition as a constituent component, especially a solid
golf ball comprising a molded and vulcanized product of the
rubber composition as the solid core is improved in
manufacture efficiency and resilience characteristics.
Specifically, by using a highly resilient polybutadiene
synthesized with a rare-earth catalyst, and compounding at
least 2 parts by weight of a metal salt of fatty acid having
a highest melting point of up to 115°C and 0.1 to 0.9 part
by weight of at least two organic peroxides having largely
different half-lives, there are accomplished advantages
including easier working, a reduced vulcanization time,
improved productivity and further improved resilience.</p><p num="0013">Accordingly, the present invention provides a golf

contain at least 60% by weight, preferably at least 80% by
weight, more preferably at least 90% by weight, most
preferably at least 95% by weight of cis-1,4-bond. Too less
a cis-1,4-bond content leads to a lowering of resilience or
restitution.</p><p num="0016">The polybutadiene should have a Mooney viscosity (ML<sub>1+4</sub>
(100°C)) of at least 30, preferably at least 38, more
preferably at least 45, most preferably at least 55,
especially at least 65, and the upper limit of Mooney
viscosity is preferably up to 140, more preferably up to
120, most preferably up to 100.</p><p num="0017">The term "Mooney viscosity" used herein refers in each
case to an industrial index of viscosity as measured with a
Mooney viscometer, which is a type of rotary plastometer
(see JIS K6300). This value is represented by the symbol
ML<sub>1+4</sub> (100°C), wherein "M" stands for Mooney viscosity, "L"
stands for large rotor (L-type), "1+4" stands for a
pre-heating time of 1 minute and a rotor rotation time of 4
minutes, and "100°C" indicates that measurement is carried
out at a temperature of 100°C.</p><p num="0018">It is requisite for the polybutadiene used herein to
be synthesized with a rare-earth catalyst. Any well-known
rare-earth catalyst may be used.</p><p num="0019">Examples of suitable catalysts include lanthanoid
series rare-earth compounds, organoaluminum compounds, 
alumoxane, and halogen-bearing compounds, optionally in
combination with Lewis bases.</p><p num="0020">Examples of suitable lanthanoid series rare-earth

and a low 1,2-vinyl content can be obtained at an excellent
polymerization activity. Preferred examples of such
rare-earth catalysts include those mentioned in JP-A
11-35633.</p><p num="0026">The polymerization of butadiene in the presence of a

10°C to 100°C.</p><p num="0027">It is also possible for the polybutadiene as component
(A) to be obtained by polymerization with the
above-described rare-earth catalyst, followed by the
reaction of an end group modifier with active end groups on
the polymer.</p><p num="0028">Any known end group modifier may be used. Examples
