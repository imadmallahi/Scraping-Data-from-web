Methods of manufacturing these polymers are also disclosed.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Molecular weight distribution (MWD), or polydispersity, is a well known variable in polymers. The molecular weight distribution, sometimes described as the ratio of weight average molecular weight (M.sub.w) to number average molecular weight (M.sub.n) (i.e., M.sub.w /M.sub.n) can be measured directly, e.g., by gel permeation chromatography techniques, or more routinely, by measuring I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 ratio, as described in ASTM D-1238. For linear polyolefins, especially linear polyethylene it is well known that as M.sub.w /M.sub.n increases, I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 also increases.</p><p>John Dealy in "Melt Rheology and Its Role in Plastics Processing" (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1990) page 597 discloses that ASTM D-1238 is employed with different loads in order to obtain an estimate of the shear rate dependence of melt viscosity, which is sensitive to weight average molecular weight (M.sub.w) and number average molecular weight (M.sub.n).</p><p>Bersted in Journal of Applied Polymer Science Vol. 19, page 2167-2177 (1975) theorized the relationship between molecular weight distribution and steady shear melt viscosity for linear polymer systems. He also showed that the broader MWD material exhibits a higher shear rate or shear stress dependency.</p><p>Ramamurthy in Journal of Rheology, 30(2), 337-357 (1986), and Moynihan, Baird and Ramanathan in Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 36, 255-263 (1990), both disclose that the onset of sharkskin (i.e., melt fracture) for linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) occurs at an apparent shear stress of 1-1.4.times.10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2, which was observed to be coincident with the change in slope of the flow curve. Ramamurthy also discloses that the onset of surface melt fracture or of gross melt fracture for high pressure low density polyethylene (HP-LDPE) occurs at an apparent shear stress of about 0.13 MPa (1.3.times.10.sup.6 dynes/cm.sup.2).</p><p>Kalika and Denn in Journal of Rheology, 31, 815-834 (1987) confirmed the surface defects or sharkskin phenomena for LLDPE, but the results of their work determined a critical shear stress of 2.3.times.10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2, significantly higher than that found by Ramamurthy and Moynihan et al.</p><p>International Patent Application (Publication No. WO 90/03414) published Apr. 5, 1990, discloses linear ethylene interpolymer blends with narrow molecular weight distribution and narrow short chain branching distributions (SCBDs). The melt processibility of the interpolymer blends is controlled by blending different molecular weight interpolymers having different narrow molecular weight distributions and different SCBDs.</p><p>Exxon Chemical Company, in the Preprints of Polyolefins VII International Conference, page 45-66, Feb. 24-27, 1991., disclose that the narrow molecular weight distribution (NMWD) resins produced by their EXXPOL™ technology have higher melt viscosity and lower melt strength than conventional Ziegler resins at the same melt index. In a recent publication, Exxon Chemical Company has also taught that NMWD polymers made using a single site catalyst create the potential for melt fracture ("New Specialty Linear Polymers (SLP) For Power Cables," by Monica Hendewerk and Lawrence Spenadel, presented at IEEE meeting in Dallas, Tex., September, 1991).</p><p>Previously known narrow molecular weight distribution linear polymers disadvantageously possessed low shear sensitivity or low I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 value, which limits the extrudability of such polymers. Additionally, such polymers possessed low melt elasticity, causing problems in melt fabrication such as film forming processes or blow molding processes (e.g., sustaining a bubble in the blown film process, or sag in the blow molding process etc.). Finally, such resins also experienced melt fracture surface properties at relatively low extrusion rates thereby processing unacceptably.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>We have now discovered a new family of substantially linear olefin polymers which have many improved properties and a method of their manufacture. The substantially linear olefin polymers have (1) high melt elasticity and, (2) relatively narrow molecular weight distributions with exceptionally good processibility while maintaining good mechanical properties and (3) they do not melt fracture over a broad range of shear stress conditions. These properties are obtained without benefit of specific processing additives. The new polymers can be successfully prepared in a continuous polymerization process using constrained geometry catalyst technology, especially when polymerized utilizing solution process technology.</p><p>The improved properties of the polymers include improved melt elasticity and processability in thermal forming processes such as extrusion, blowing film, injection molding and blowmolding.</p><p>Substantially linear polymers made according to the present invention have the following novel properties:</p><p>a) a melt flow ratio, I.sub.10 /I.sub.2, ≧5.63,</p><p>b) a molecular weight distribution, M.sub.w /M.sub.n, defined by the equation:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->M.sub.w /M.sub.n ≧(I.sub.10 /I.sub.2)-4.63,</pre></p><p> and</p><p>c) a critical shear stress at onset of gross melt fracture of greater than about 4</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a polymerization process suitable for making the polymers of the present invention.</p><p>FIG. 2 plots data describing the relationship between I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 and M.sub.w /M.sub.n for polymer Examples 5 and 6 of the invention, and from comparative examples 7-9.</p><p>FIG. 3 plots the shear stress versus shear rate for Example 5 and comparative example 7, described herein.</p><p>FIG. 4 plots the shear stress versus shear rate for Example 6 and comparative example 9, described herein.</p><p>FIG. 5 plots the heat seal strength versus heat seal temperature of film made from Examples 10 and 12, and comparative examples 11 and 13. described herein.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Other properties of the substantially linear polymers include:</p><p>a) a density from about 0.85 grams/cubic centimeter (g/cc) to about 0.97 g/cc (tested in accordance with ASTM D-792), and</p><p>b) a melt index, MI, from about 0.01 grams/10 minutes to about 1000 gram/10 minutes.</p><p>Preferably the melt flow ratio, I.sub.10 /I.sub.2, is from about 7 to about 20.</p><p>The molecular weight distribution (i.e., M.sub.w /M.sub.n) is preferably less than about 5, especially less than about 3.5, and most preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.5.</p><p>Throughout this disclosure, "melt index" or "I.sub.2 " is measured in accordance with ASTM D-1238 (190/2.16); "I.sub.10 " is measured in accordance with ASTM D-1238 (190/10).</p><p>The melt tension of these new polymers is also surprisingly good, e.g., as high as about 2 grams or more, especially for polymers which have a very narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e., M.sub.w /M.sub.n from about 1.5 to about 2.5).</p><p>The substantially linear polymers of the present invention can be homopolymers of C.sub.2 -C.sub.20 olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, etc., or they can be interpolymers of ethylene with at least one C.sub.3 -C.sub.20 α-olefin and/or C.sub.2 -C.sub.20 acetylenically unsaturated monomer and/or C.sub.4 -C.sub.18 diolefins. The substantially, linear polymers of the present invention can also be interpolymers of ethylene with at least one of the above C.sub.3 -C.sub.20 α-olefins, diolefins and/or acetylenically unsaturated monomers in combination with other unsaturated monomers.</p><p>Monomers usefully polymerized according to the present invention include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, acetylenic compounds, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, carbon monoxide, etc. Preferred monomers include the C.sub.2-10 α-olefins especially ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. Other preferred monomers include styrene, halo- or alkyl substituted styrenes, tetrafluoroethylene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, 1,4-hexadiene, and naphthenics (e.g., cyclo-pentene, cyclo-hexene and cyclo-octene).</p><p>The term "substantially linear" polymers means that the polymer backbone is either unsubstituted or substituted with up to 3 long chain branches/1000 carbons Preferred polymers are substituted with about 0.01 long chain branches/1000 carbons to about 3 long chain branches/1000 carbons, more preferably from about 0.01 long chain branches/1000 carbons to about 1 long chain branches/1000 carbons, and especially from about 0.3 long chain branches/1000 carbons to about 1 long chain branches/1000 carbons.</p><p>Long chain branching is defined herein as a chain length of at least about 6 carbons, above which the length cannot be distinguished using .sup.13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The long chain branch can be as long as about the same length as the length of the polymer back-bone.</p><p>Long chain branching is determined by using .sup.13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and is quantified using the method of Randall (Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., C29 (2&amp;3), p. 285-297), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by refrence.</p><p>"Melt tension" is measured by a specially designed pulley transducer in conjunction with the melt indexer. Melt tension is the load that the extrudate or filament exerts while passing over the pulley at the standard speed of 30 rpm. The melt tension measurement is similar to the "Melt Tension Tester" made by Toyoseiki and is described by John Dealy in "Rheometers for Molten Plastics", published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. (1982) on page 250-251.</p><p>The "Theological processing index" (PI) is the apparent viscosity (in kpoise) of a polymer measured by a gas extrusion rheometer (GER). The gas extrusion rheometer is described by M. Shida, R. N. Shroff and L. V. Cancio in Polymer Engineering Science, Vol. 17, no. 11, p. 770 (1977), and in "Rheometers for Molten Plastics" by John Dealy, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. (1982) on page 77, both publications of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. All GER experiments are performed at a temperature of 190 between 5250 to 500 psig using a 0.0296 inch diameter, 20:1 L/D used to identify the melt fracture phenomena. According to Ramamurthy in Journal of Rheology, 30(2), 337-357, 1986, above a certain critical flow rate, the observed extrudate irregularities may be broadly classified into two main types: surface melt fracture and gross melt fracture.</p><p>Surface melt fracture occurs under apparently steady flow conditions and ranges in detail from loss of specular gloss to the more severe form of "sharkskin". Gross melt fracture occurs at unsteady flow conditions and ranges in detail from regular (alternating rough and smooth, helical, etc.) to random distortions. For commercial acceptability, (e.g., in blown film products), surface defects should be minimal, if not absent. The critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) and onset of gross melt fracture (OGMF) will be used herein based on the changes of surface roughness and configurations of the extrudates extruded by a GER. Preferably, the critical shear stress at the OGMF and the critical shear stress at the OSMF for the substantially linear ethylene polymers described herein is greater than about 4 greater than about 2.8.times.10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2, respectively.</p><p>For the polymers described herein, the PI is the apparent viscosity (in Kpoise) of a material measured by GER at a temperature of 190 at nitrogen pressure of 2500 psig using a 0.0296 inch diameter, 20:1 L/D die, or corresponding apparent shear stress of 2.15.times.10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2 The novel polymers described herein preferably have a PI in the range of about 0.01 kpoise to about 50 kpoise, preferably about 15 kpoise or less.</p><p>The SCBDI (Short Chain Branch Distribution Index) or CDBI (Composition Distribution Branch Index) is defined as the weight percent of the polymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50 percent of the median total molar comonomer content The CDBI of an polymer is readily calculated from data obtained from techniques known in the art, such as, for example, temperature rising elution fractionation (abbreviated herein as "TREF") as described, for example, in Wild et al, Journal of Polymer Science, Poly. Phys. Ed., Vol. 20, p. 441 (1982), or in U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,081, both disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The SCBDI or CDBI for the new polymers of the present invention is preferably greater than about 30 percent, especially greater than about 50 percent.</p><p>The most unique characteristic of the presently claimed polymers is a highly unexpected flow property as shown in FIG. 2, where the I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 value is essentially independent of polydispersity index (i.e. M.sub.w /M.sub.n). This is contrasted with conventional polyethylene resins having rheological properties such that as the polydispersity index increases, the I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 value also increases. Measurement of the polydispersity index is done according to the following technique:</p><p>The polymers are analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Waters 150C high temperature chromatographic unit equipped with three linear mixed bed columns (Polymer Laboratories (10 micron particle size)), operating at a system temperature of 140 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, from which about 0.5% by weight solutions of the samples are prepared for injection. The flow rate is 1.0 milliliter/minute and the injection size is 100 microliters.</p><p>The molecular weight determination is deduced by using narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories) in conjunction with their elution volumes. The equivalent polyethylene molecular weights are determined by using appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polyethylene and polystyrene (as described by Williams and Word in Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Letters, Vol. 6, (621) 1968, incorporated herein by reference) to derive the equation:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->M.sub.polyethylene =(a)(M.sub.polystyrene).sup.b</pre></p><p>In this equation, a=0.4316 and b=1 Weight average molecular weight, M.sub.w, is calculated in the usual manner according to the formula:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->M.sub.w =(R)(w.sub.i)(M.sub.i)</pre></p><p>where w.sub.i and M.sub.i are the weight fraction and molecular weight respectively of the ith fraction eluting from the GPC column.</p><p>Another highly unexpected characteristic of the polymers of the present invention is their non-susceptibility to melt fracture or the formation of extrudate defects during high pressure, high speed extrusion. Preferably, polymers of the present invention do not experience "sharkskin" or surface melt fracture during the GER extrusion process even at an extrusion pressure of 5000 psi and corresponding apparent stress of 4.3.times.10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2. In contrast, a conventional LLDPE experiences "sharkskin" or onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) at an apparent stress under comparable conditions as low as 1.0-1.4.times.10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2.</p><p>Improvements of melt elasticity and processibility over conventional LLDPE resins with similar MI are most pronounced when I.sub.2 is lower than about 3 grams/10 minutes. Improvements of physical properties such as strength properties, heat seal properties, and optical properties, over the conventional LLDPE resins with similar MI, are most pronounced when I.sub.2 is lower than about 100 grams/10 minutes. The substantially linear polymers of the present invention have processibility similar to that of High Pressure LDPE while possessing strength and other physical properties similar to those of conventional LLDPE, without the benefit of special adhesion promoters (e.g., processing additives such as Viton™ fluoroelastomers made by E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company).</p><p>The improved melt elasticity and processibility of the substantially linear polymers according to the present invention result, it is believed, from their method of production. The polymers may be produced via a continuous controlled polymerization process using at least one reactor, but can also be produced using multiple reactors (e.g., using a multiple reactor configuration as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,342, incorporated herein by reference) at a polymerization temperature and pressure sufficient to produce the interpolymers having the desired properties. According to one embodiment of the present process, the polymers are produced in a continuous process, as opposed to a batch process. Preferably, the polymerization temperature is from about 20 250 narrow molecular weight distribution polymer (M.sub.w /M.sub.n of from about 1.5 to about 2.5) having a higher I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 ratio (e.g. I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 of about 7 or more, preferably at least about 8, especially at least about 9) is desired, the ethylene concentration in the reactor is preferably not more than about 8 percent by weight of the reactor contents, especially not more than about 4 percent by weight of the reactor contents. Preferably, the polymerization is performed in a solution polymerization process. Generally, manipulation or I.sub.10 /I.sub.2 while holding M.sub.w /M.sub.n relatively low for producing the novel polymers described herein is a function of reactor temperature and/or ethylene concentration. Reduced ethylene concentration and higher temperature generally produces higher I.sub.10 /I.sub.2.</p><p>Suitable catalysts for use herein preferably include constrained geometry catalysts as disclosed in U.S. application Ser.

Tris(pentafluorphenyl)borane is a commonly available Lewis acid that may be readly prepared according to known techniques. The compound is disclosed in Marks, et al. J. Am. Chem.

Also, any reference to a Group or Groups shall be to the Group or Groups as reflected in this Periodic Table of the Elements using the IUPAC system for numbering groups.</p><p>It is believed that in the constrained geometry catalysts used herein the metal atom is forced to greater exposure of the active metal site because one or more substituents on the single cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl group forms a portion of a ring structure including the metal atom, wherein the metal is both bonded to an adjacent covalent moiety and held in association with the cyclopentadienyl group through an η.sup.5 or other n-bonding interaction. It is understood that each respective bond between the metal atom and the constituent atoms of the cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl group need not be equivalent. That is, the metal may be symmetrically or unsymmetrically n-bound to the cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl group.</p><p>The geometry of the active metal site is further defined as follows. The centroid of the cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl group may be defined as the average of the respective X, Y, and Z coordinates of the atomic centers forming the cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl group. The angle, Θ, formed at the metal center between the centroid of the cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl group and each other ligand of the metal complex may be easily calculated by standard techniques of single crystal X-ray diffraction. Each of these angles may increase or decrease depending on the molecular structure of the constrained geometry metal complex. Those complexes wherein one or more of the angles, Θ, is less than in a similar, comparative complex differing only in the fact that the constrain-inducing substituent is replaced by hydrogen have constrained geometry for purposes of the present invention. Preferably one or more of the above angles, Θ, decrease by at least 5 percent, more preferably 7 percent, compared to the comparative complex. Highly preferably, the average value of all bond angles, Θ, is also less than in the comparative complex.</p><p>Preferably, monocyclopentadienyl metal coordination complexes of group 4 or lanthanide metals according to the present invention have constrained geometry such that the smallest angle, Θ, is less than 115 more preferably less than 110 105</p><p>Other compounds which are useful in the catalyst compositions of this invention, especially compounds containing other Group 4 or Lanthanide metals, will, of course, be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p><p>In general, the polymerization according to the present invention may be accomplished at conditions well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerization reactions, that is, temperatures from 0 to 250 (100 MPa). Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase or other process conditions may be employed if desired. A support may be employed but preferably the catalysts are used in a homogeneous manner. It will, of courses be appreciated that the active catalyst system, especially nonionic catalysts, form in situ if the catalyst and the cocatalyst components thereof are added directly to the polymerization process and a suitable solvent or diluent, including condensed monomer, is used in said polymerization process. It is, however, preferred to form the active catalyst in a separate step in a suitable solvent prior to adding the same to the polymerization mixture.</p><p>The polymerization conditions for manufacturing the polymers of the present invention are generally those useful in the solution polymerization process, although the application of the present invention is not limited thereto. Gas phase polymerization processes are also believed to be useful, provided the proper catalysts and polymerization conditions are employed.</p><p>Fabricated articles made from the novel olefin polymers may be prepared using all of the conventional polyolefin processing techniques.

Examples 1-4 are each stabilized with 1250 ppm Calcium Stearate, 200 ppm Irgonox 1010, and 1600 ppm Irgafos 168. Irgafos™ 168 is a phosphite stabilizer and Irgonox™ 1010 is a hindered polyphenol stabilizer (e.g., tetrakis [methylene 3-(3,5-dfitert.butyl-4-hydroxy-phenylpropionate)]methane.

The reactor feed mixture (6) is continuously injected into the reactor (9). The metal complex (7) and the cocatalyst (8) (the cocatalyst is tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane for Examples 1-4 herein which forms the ionic catalyst insitu) are combined into a single stream and also continuously injected into the reactor. Sufficient residence time is allowed for the metal complex and cocatalyst to react to the desired extent for use in the polymerization reactions, at least about 10 seconds. For the polymerization reactions of Examples 1-4, the reactor pressure is held constant at about 490 psig.
