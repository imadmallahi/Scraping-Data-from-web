Damage eventually occurs to the optic nerve head, resulting in irreversible loss of visual function. If untreated, glaucoma may eventually lead to blindness. Elevated intraocular pressure or ocular hypertension, is now believed by the majority of ophthalmologists to represent the earliest phase in the onset of glaucoma.</p><p num="p0007">Many of the drugs formerly used to treat glaucoma proved unsatisfactory. The early methods of treating glaucoma employed pilocarpine and produced undesirable local effects that made this drug, though valuable, unsatisfactory as a first line drug. More recently, clinicians have noted that many β-adrenergic antagonists are effective in reducing intraocular pressure. While many of these agents are effective for this purpose, there exist some patients with whom this treatment is not effective or not sufficiently effective. Many of these agents also have other characteristics, e.g., membrane stabilizing activity, that become more apparent with increased doses and render them unacceptable for chronic ocular use and can also cause cardiovascular effects.</p><p num="p0008">Although pilocarpine and β-adrenergic antagonists reduce intraocular pressure, none of these drugs manifests its action by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and thus they do not take advantage of reducing the contribution to aqueous humor formation made by the carbonic anhydrase pathway.</p><p num="p0009">Agents referred to as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease the formation of aqueous humor by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. While such carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are now used to treat intraocular pressure by systemic and topical routes, current therapies using these agents, particularly those using systemic routes are still not without undesirable effects. Because carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have a profound effect in altering basic physiological processes, the avoidance of a systemic route of administration serves to diminish, if not entirely 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
eliminate, those side effects caused by inhibition of carbonic anhydrase such as metabolic acidosis, vomiting, numbness, tingling, general malaise and the like. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>--></p><p num="p0010">Topically effective carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,386,098; 4,416,890; 4,426,388; 4,668,697; 4,863,922; 4,797,413; 5,378,703, 5,240,923 and 5,153,192.</p><p num="p0011">Prostaglandins and prostaglandin derivatives are also known to lower intraocular pressure. U.S. Patent 4,883,819 to Bito describes the use and synthesis of PGAs, PGBs and PGCs in reducing intraocular pressure. U.S. Patent 4,824,857 to Goh et al. describes the use and synthesis of PGD2 and derivatives thereof in lowering intraocular pressure including derivatives wherein C-10 is replaced with nitrogen. U.S. Patent 5,001,153 to Ueno et al. describes the use and synthesis of 13,14-dihydro- 15-keto prostaglandins and prostaglandin derivatives to lower intraocular pressure. U.S. Patent 4,599,353 describes the use of eicosanoids and eicosanoid derivatives including prostaglandins and prostaglandin inhibitors in lowering intraocular pressure. Prostaglandin and prostaglandin derivatives lower intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow. This is true for both the F type and A type of Pgs and hence presumably also for the B, C, D, E and J types of prostaglandins and derivatives thereof. A problem with using prostaglandin derivatives to lower intraocular pressure is that these compounds often induce an initial increase in intraocular pressure, can change the color of eye pigmentation and cause proliferation of some tissues surrounding the eye. As can be seen, there are several current therapies for treating glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure, but the efficacy and the side effect profiles of these agents are not ideal. Recently potassium channel Mockers were found to reduce intraocular pressure in the eye and therefore provide yet one more approach to the treatment of ocular hypertension and the degenerative ocular conditions related thereto. . Blockage of potassium channels can diminish fluid secretion, and under some circumstances, increase smooth muscle contraction and would be expected to lower IOP and have neuroprotective effects in the eye.

More preferred potassium channel blockers are high conductance, calcium activated potassium (maxi-K) channel blockers. Maxi-K channels are a family of ion channels that are prevalent in neuronal, smooth muscle and epithelial tissues and which are gated by membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+.</p><p num="p0122">Intraocular pressure (IOP) is controlled by aqueous humor dynamics. Aqueous humor is produced at the level of the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
is cleared primarily via outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Aqueous humor inflow is controlled by ion transport processes. It is thought that maxi-K channels in non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells indirectly control chloride secretion by two mechanisms; these channels maintain a hyperpolarized membrane potential (interior negative) which provides a driving force for chloride efflux from the cell, and they also provide a counter ion (K+) for chloride ion movement. Water moves passively with KC1 allowing production of aqueous humor. Inhibition of maxi-K channels in this tissue would diminish inflow. Maxi-K channels have also been shown to control the contractility of certain smooth muscle tissues, and, in some cases, channel blockers can contract quiescent muscle, or increase the myogenic activity of spontaneously active tissue. Contraction of ciliary muscle would open the trabecular meshwork and stimulate aqueous humor outflow, as occurs with pilocarpine. Therefore maxi-K channels could profoundly influence aqueous humor dynamics in several ways; blocking this channel would decrease IOP by affecting inflow or outflow processes or by a combination of affecting both inflow/outflow processes.</p><p num="p0123">The present invention is based upon the finding that maxi-K channels, if blocked, inhibit aqueous humor production by inhibiting net solute and H2O efflux and therefore lower IOP. This finding suggests that maxi-K channel blockers are useful for treating other ophthamological dysfunctions such as macular edema and macular degeneration. It is known that lowering of IOP promotes increased blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. Accordingly, this invention relates to a method for treating macular edema, macular degeneration or a combination thereof.</p><p num="p0124">Additionally, macular edema is swelling within the retina within the critically important central visual zone at the posterior pole of the eye. An accumulation of fluid within the retina tends to detach the neural elements from one another and from their local blood supply, creating a dormancy of visual function in the area.</p><p num="p0125">Glaucoma is characterized by progressive atrophy of the optic nerve and is frequently associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). It is possible to treat glaucoma, however, without necessarily affecting IOP by using drugs that impart a neuroprotective effect. See Arch. Ophthalmol. Vol. 112, Jan 1994, pp. 37-44; Investigative Ophthamol. &amp; Visual Science, 32, 5, April 1991, pp. 1593-99. It is believed that maxi-K channel blockers which lower IOP are useful for providing a neuroprotective effect. They are also believed to be effective for increasing retinal and optic nerve head blood velocity and increasing retinal and optic nerve oxygen by 
<!-- EPO <DP n="17"/>-->
lowering IOP, which when coupled together benefits optic nerve health. As a result, this invention further relates to a method for increasing retinal and optic nerve head blood velocity, increasing retinal and optic nerve oxygen tension as well as providing a neuroprotective effect or a combination thereof. The maxi-K channel blockers used are preferably administered in the form of ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration to the eye such as solutions, ointments, creams or as a solid insert. Formulations of this compound may contain from 0.01 to 5% and especially 0.5 to 2% of medicament. Higher dosages as, for example, about 10% or lower dosages can be employed provided the dose is effective in reducing intraocular pressure, treating glaucoma, increasing blood flow velocity or oxygen tension or providing a neuroprotective effect. For a single dose, from between 0.001 to 5.0 mg, preferably 0.005 to 2.0 mg, and especially 0.005 to 1.0 mg of the compound can be applied to the human eye.</p><p num="p0126">The pharmaceutical preparation which contains the compound may be conveniently admixed with a non-toxic pharmaceutical organic carrier, or with a non- toxic pharmaceutical inorganic carrier.

If appropriate, a second stage seed fermentation may be carried out in the seed medium (Table 1) for greater production of mycelial mass by inoculating fresh seed medium with a portion of the culture growth and then incubating under similar conditions but for a shortened period. The resulting growth then may be employed to inoculate, a production medium, preferably the Liquid Production Medium (Table 2). The fermentation liquid production medium inoculated with the seed culture growth is incubated for 3 to 28 days, usually 7 to 11 days, with agitation. Agitation and aeration of the culture mixture may be accomplished in a variety of ways. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the fermentation mixture within the fermentor, by various pumping equipment or by the passage of sterile air through the medium. Aeration may be effected by passing sterile air through the fermentation mixture.</p><p num="p0150">Preferred seed and production media for carrying out the fermentation include the following media:

The identity of Maxi-K currents was confirmed by the sensitivity of channel open probability to membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration.</p><p num="p0285">Data acquisition was controlled by PULSE software (HEKA Elektronic) and stored on the hard drive of a Macintosh computer (Apple Computers) for later analysis using PULSEFTT (HEKA Elektronic) and Igor (Wavemetrics, Oswego, OR) software.</p><p num="p0286">Results: The effects of the compounds of the present invention on Maxi-K channels were examined in excised inside-out membrane patches. The membrane potential was held at -80 mV and brief voltage steps to positive membrane potentials (typically +50 mV) were applied once per 15 seconds to transiently open Maxi-K channels. The fraction of channels blocked in each experiment was calculated from the reduction in peak current caused by application of the specified compound to the internal side of the membrane patch. As a positive control in each experiment, Maxi- K currents were eliminated at pulse potentials after the patch was transiently exposed to a low concentration of calcium (&lt;10 nM) made by adding 1 mM EGTA to the standard bath solution with no added calcium. A 1 nM concentration of compound la caused an 88% decrease in Maxi-K channel currents. After removal of compound from the bath, little or no recovery of peak current amplitude was observed within 15 minutes.</p><p num="p0287">EXAMPLE 5</p><p num="p0288">The activity of the compound can also be quantified by the following assay.</p><p num="p0289">The identification of inhibitors of the Maxi-K channel is based on the ability of expressed Maxi-K channels to set cellular resting potential after transfection of both alpha and betal subunits of the channel in HEK-293 cells and after being

incubated with potassium channel blockers that selectively eliminate the endogenous potassium conductances of HEK-293 cells. In the absence of Maxi-K channel inhibitors, the transfected HEK-293 cells display a hyperpolarized membrane potential, negative inside, close to E<sub>K</sub> (-80 mV) which is a consequence of the activity of Maxi-K channels. Blockade of the Maxi-K channel by incubation with Maxi-K channel blockers will cause cell depolarization. Changes in membrane potential can be determined with voltage-sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) dye pairs that use two components, a donor coumarin (CC<sub>2</sub>DMPE) and an acceptor oxanol (DiSBAC<sub>2</sub>(3)). Oxanol is a lipophilic anion and distributes across the membrane according to membrane potential. Under normal conditions, when the inside of the cell is negative with respect to the outside, oxanol is accumulated at the outer leaflet of the membrane and excitation of coumarin will cause FRET to occur. Conditions that lead to membrane depolarization will cause the oxanol to redistribute to the inside of the cell, and, as a consequence, a decrease in FRET. Thus, the ratio change</p><p num="p0290">(donor/acceptor) increases after membrane depolarization, which determines if a test compound actively blocks the maxi-K channel.</p><p num="p0291">The HEK-293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection , 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland, 20852 under accession number ATCC CRL-1573. Any restrictions relating to public access to the cell line shall be irrevocably removed upon patent issuance.</p><p num="p0292">Transfection of the alpha and betal subunits of the maxi-K channel in HEK- 293 cells was carried out as follows: HEK-293 cells were plated in 100 mm tissue culture treated dishes at a density of 3xl0<sup>6</sup> cells per dish, and a total of five dishes were prepared. Cells were grown in a medium consisting of Dulbecco' s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine serum, IX L- Glutamine, and IX Penicillin/Streptomycin, at 37°C, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. For transfection with Maxi-K hαφCIneo) and Maxi-K hβl(pIRESpuro) DNAs, 150 μl FuGENE6™ was added drop- wise into 10 ml of serum free/phenol-red free DMEM and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes. Then, the FuGENE6™ solution was added drop-wise to a DNA solution containing 25 μg of each plasmid DNA, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After the incubation period, 2 ml of the FuGENE6™/DNA solution was added drop- wise to each plate of cells and the cells were allowed to grow two days under the same conditions as described above. At the end of the second day, cells were put under selection media that consisted of

DMEM supplemented with both 600 μg/ml G418 and 0.75 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were grown until separate colonies were formed. Five colonies were collected and transferred to a 6 well tissue culture treated dish. A total of 75 colonies were collected. Cells were allowed to grow until a confluent monolayer was obtained. Cells were then tested for the presence of Maxi-K channel alpha and betal subunits</p><p num="p0293">1 ^ using an assay that monitors binding of I-iberiotoxin-D19Y/Y36F to the channel. Cells expressing <sup>125</sup>I-iberiotoxin-D19Y/Y36F binding activity were then evaluated in a functional assay that monitors the capability of Maxi-K channels to control the membrane potential of transfected HEK-293 cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) Aurora Biosciences technology with a VIPR instrument. The colony giving the largest signal to noise ratio was subjected to limiting dilution. For this, cells were resuspended at approximately 5 cells/ml, and 200 μl were plated in individual wells in a 96 well tissue culture treated plate, to add ca. one cell per well. A total of two 96 well plates were made. When a confluent monolayer was formed, the cells were transferred to 6 well tissue culture treated plates. A total of 62 wells were transferred. When a confluent monolayer was obtained, cells were tested using the FRET-functional assay. Transfected cells giving the best signal to noise ratio were identified and used in subsequent functional assays. For functional assays: The transfected cells (2E+06 Cells/mL) are then plated on 96- well poly-D- lysine plates at a density of about 100,000 cells/well and incubated for about 16 to about 24 hours. The medium is aspirated of the cells and the cells washed one time with 100 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS). One hundred microliters of about 9 μM coumarin (CC<sub>2</sub>DMPE)-0.02% pluronic-127 in D-PBS per well is added and the wells are incubated in the dark for about 30 minutes. The cells are washed two times with 100 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μl of about 4.5 μM of oxanol (DiSBAC<sub>2</sub>(3)) in (mM) 140 NaCl, 0.1 KC1, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 glucose is added. Three micromolar of an inhibitor of endogenous potassium conductance of HEK-293 cells is added. A maxi- K channel blocker is added (about 0.01 micromolar to about 10 micromolar) and the cells are incubated at room temperature in the dark for about 30 minutes.</p><p num="p0294">The plates are loaded into a voltage/ion probe reader (VIPR) instrument, and the fluorescence emission of both CC<sub>2</sub>DMPE and DiSBAC<sub>2</sub>(3) are recorded for 10 sec.

2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 glucose are added and the fluorescence emission of both dyes recorded for an additional 10 sec. The ratio CC<sub>2</sub>DMPE/DiSBAC<sub>2</sub>(3), before addition of high-potassium solution equals 1. In the absence of maxi-K channel inhibitor, the ratio after addition of high-potassium solution varies between 1.65-2.0. When the maxi-K channel has been completely inhibited by either a known standard or test compound, this ratio remains at 1. It is possible, therefore, to titrate the activity of a maxi-K channel inhibitor by monitoring the concentration-dependent change in the fluorescence ratio. The activity for blocking maxi-K channels by compounds la and lb is 100 nM or less.</p><p num="p0295">EXAMPLE 6 Intraocular pressure (IOP) Measurements in Rabbits</p><p num="p0296">Normotensive Dutch Belted rabbits (2.3 kg) of either sex were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle during these experiments.

Before tonometry, one drop of 0.05% proparacaine was applied to the corneas to minimize any discomfort to the animal.

A masked design was utilized, where the person involved in drug administration and measurement of IOP had no knowledge of the solutions' contents. Subsequently, IOP measurements were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hr after topical applications of drug. At the end of each day's measurements, stability of the tonometer was determined using the calibrator/verifier. Results</p><p num="p0298">Unilateral topical application of Compounds la, or lb (0.5, 0.1 and 0.01 %) to normal Dutch Belted rabbits elicited reduction of IOP of 3.7, 3.3 and 3 mmHg, respectively.

In addition, a significant contralateral effect was also observed at all doses tested.
