This enables using these materials in highly demanding applications, such as, for instance, off shore piping, which requires outstanding performances in terms of impact resistance, high deformability (for unreeling-reeling), high thermal resistance. Thus, although fluoropolymers of high molar mass (and thus high melt viscosity) are preferable because of improved mechanical properties, processing these materials is more difficult. In particular, in extrusion process, they display rheology problems, accounting for increased energy consumption during extrusion and more severe extrusion conditions to be applied (with consequent risks of thermal degradation of the polymer). In this case, finished parts (extrusion or injection molded) made from these fluoropolymers have generally surface defects like cracks, shark-skin, fish-eyes and the like.</p><p num="p0005">Processing aids have been thus largely used to obviate these problems; nevertheless, they have several drawbacks. Due to their limited thermal stability at processing temperature, benefits of their addition are lost and fumes are released during processing; thermal degradation residues generate in fmal parts structural defects and voids that can be detrimental to mechanical properties. Moreover, due to their incompatibility with the fluoropolymer itself, they tend to segregate and yield uneven dispersion, so that the benefits in improving rheological behavior are lost.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p num="p0006">This invention thus aims at providing a fluoropolymer composition with increased processability and yielding finished parts with outstanding surface aspect.</p><p num="p0007">This problem is remarkably solved by the fluoropolymer composition of the invention, comprising :
