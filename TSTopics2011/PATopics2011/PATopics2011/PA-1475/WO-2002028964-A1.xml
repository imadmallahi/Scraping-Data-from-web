high- temperature (100°C) compression set, mechanical strength and moldability The composition can be used at temperatures up to 150°C and can be used useful as a molding material for various products. Thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) of a rubberlike soft material, requiring no vulcanization, and having moldability like thermoplastic resins are highly desirable, especially for automobile parts, household electric appliance parts, electric wire- protecting materials, coatings, medical appliance parts, miscellaneous goods, footwear, and the like. Various elastomer compositions containing the hydrogen- ated product of vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon/conjugated diene block copolymers (hereinafter referred to as hydrogenated block copolymer) have been used in TPE applications.</p><p num="p0003">Gels containing block copolymers, polyphenylene ether (PPO), and at least 500 parts by weight (pbw) extender oil per 100 pbw block copolymer are known but generally are too soft, have insufficient tensile strength, and have a compression set that is less than desirable.</p><p num="p0004">Also known are high-impact polyphenylene compositions that include a PPO resin, a hydrogenated block copolymer, and an oil. These can provide thermoplastic resins having good processability but have not been shown to provide TPEs having superior compression set at 100°C.</p><p num="p0005">Combinations of PPO, hydrogenated

 block copolymer (SEBS), and a non-aromatic oil also are known. One such combination includes 100 pbw SEBS per hundred pbw rubber (hereinafter phr) and from about 10 to 30 phr non-aromatic oil, has a weight ratio of SEBS/PPO of from about 90:1 to about 30:70, and has a compression set at 100°C of less than 65%. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 Previously available hydrogenated block copolymer-based TPEs exhibiting a high-temperature (100°C) compression set of at least 65% do not reach the required level of high-temperature compression set for vulcanized rubber applications. Consequently, to obtain hydrogenated block copolymer-based TPE compositions that can be molded repeatedly without losing their excellent high- temperature compression set often requires the use of a fourth ingredient such as a polyolefin or polystyrene. In some instances, a curative such as a peroxide, also has been added.</p><p num="p0006">The use of low molecular weight oils to obtain soft gels often results in oil exuding to the surface of a molded part formed from a composition containing such gels, resulting in potential contamination of the immediate area and increasing the hardness of the part. Furthermore, oils are readily extractable from a molded part when that part is contacted with cleaning fluids or aqueous solutions containing solvents or surfactants, thereby limiting the areas where such parts can be used. Attempts to form non-oil polymeric compositions of SEPS/PPO matrices by bulk mixing have suffered from poor compatibilization. Therefore, an extra step of dissolving the components in solvent prior to mixing is often required. This step increases both the cost and time required to form the desired polymer compositions. Accordingly, a strong need remains for TPE compositions that can be processed easily and used repeatedly but which are superior in high-temperature compression set and can be obtained in a simple manner, preferably using bulk mixing equipment.</p><p num="p0007">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a composition ofhydrogenated block copolymer, such as hydrogenated SEBS; PPO; amorphous polyolefin and compatibilizer blended in bulk proportions specifically selected with respective weight proportions sufficient to provide a soft gel having a service temperature of up to about 150°C and a Shore A hardness of no more than about 30. An exemplary embodiment includes a composition having a compression set at 100°C for 22 hours of less than 65% that includes 100 pbw hydrogenated polymer, 10 to

The diblock polymer acts to compatibilize the other components. The hydrogenated polymer includes at least two blocks derived from a vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon and at least one block derived from a conjugated diene. The PPO resin includes a binding unit of the general formula</p><p num="p0008"><img id="imgf000004_0001" orientation="portrait" wi="37" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" file="imgf000004_0001.tif" inline="no" he="37"/>

The composition has damping properties useful in producing molded products having good resistance to heat and high elasticity.</p><p num="p0009">One advantage of the present polymer composition is that compression set values of less than about 65% may be consistently achieved when the non oil (low oil) blend is mixed in bulk mixing equipment. This eliminates the step of dissolving the components in a common solvent.</p><p num="p0010">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</p><p num="p0011">The present invention provides a hydrogenated block copolymer composition having a compression set at 100°C of 65% or less.

Both polymer blocks may take any one or more of random, tapered and partial block arrange- ments. When the numbers of both of the A and B blocks are 2 or more, the structures of the respective A and B blocks may be the same or different.</p><p num="p0013">The vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon contributed units are one or more of styrene, α-methylstyrene, 1 -vinyl naphthalene, 2- vinyl naphthalene, 1-α- methylvinyl naphthalene, 2-α-methylvinyl naphthalene, vinyltoluene, as well as alkyl, cycloalkyL, aryl, alkaryl, and alkyl derivatives thereof, in which the total number of carbon atoms in the combined hydrobarbon is not greater than 15, as well as any di- or tri-vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons, and the like. Of these, styrene is preferred.</p><p num="p0014">Conjugated diene contributed units are one or more of butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, and 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene. Butadiene and/or isoprene, are preferred. The polymer block composed mainly of a conjugated diene before hydrogenation may contain any amount, expressed by mole percent, of the conjugated diene microstructure, and, for example, a polybutadiene block contains 5 to 90 mole percent, preferably 10 to 50 mole percent of the 1,2- vinyl bond.</p><p num="p0015">The hydrogenated block copolymer of the above structure has a number average molecular weight (M<sub>n</sub>) of from about 100,000 to 1,000,000, preferably from 125,000 to 800,000, more preferably from 150,000 to 500,000, and a molecular weight distribution ratio (M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>) of 10 or less. The molecular structure type of the hydrogenated block copolymer may be any of straight chain, branched involving partial coupling with a coupling agent, radial, and or the star-shaped types.</p><p num="p0016">There is no limitation to a method for producing these hydrogenated block copolymer as long as they have the structure described above. These copolymers can be obtained by synthesizing a vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon/conjugated diene block copolymer in an inert solvent using an organolithium anionic imtiatior and, if necessary, a 1,2- vinyl bond modifier such as ether compounds, tertiary amines, etc., according to methods known in the art, and then hydrogen-

ating the resulting block copolymer according to other known methods. Exemplary vinyl modifiers include one or more of hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, N,N,N',N<sup>f</sup>-tetramethylethylene idamine, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane, diethyl ether, triethylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tri-n-butylphosphine, p-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxy ethane, dimethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, ethyl propyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di- n-octyl ether, anisole, dibenzyl ether, diphenyl ether, dimethylethylamine, bis- oxolanyl propane, tri-n-propyl amine, trimethyl amine, triethyl amine, N,N-dimethyl aniline, N-ethylpiperidine, N-methyl-N-ethyl aniline, and N-methylmorpholine.</p><p num="p0017">For example, the B block can be changed in form to a polymer block of an olefinic compound by hydrogenating at least 80 mole percent of the aliphatic double bond coming from the conjugated diene of the vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon/conjugated diene block copolymer.</p><p num="p0018">Also, there is no particular limitation to the hydrogenation ratio of the aromatic double bond coming from the A block and the vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon incorporated as a comonomer (as need arises) in the B block, but the hydrogenation ratio preferably is 20 mole percent or less. The amount of unhydrogenated aliphatic double bonds contained in the hydrogenated block copolymer can easily be deterøiined by methods including IR spectroscopy and NMR.</p><p num="p0019">PPO improves the high-temperature compression set. This resin is a homo- and/or co-polymer that includes a binding unit of the general formula</p><p num="p0020"><img id="imgf000007_0001" orientation="portrait" wi="36" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" file="imgf000007_0001.tif" inline="no" he="36"/>
 where R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, and R<sup>4</sup> are defined as above. Common PPOs include poly(2,6- dimethyl 1,4-phenylene ether), poly(2-methyl-6-ethyl-l,4-phenylene ether), poly(2,6-diphenyl- 1 ,4-phenylene ether), poly(2-methyl-6-phenyl- 1 ,4-phenylene

Of these polymers, ρoly(2,6-dimethyl- 1,4-ρhenylene ether) is preferable. The amount of the polyphenylene ether blended is preferably in the range about 10 to 150 pbw based on 100 pbw hydrogenated block copolymer. When the amount exceeds 150 pbw, the hardness of hydrogenated block copolymer compositions obtained is too high, so that the compositions lose flexibility and become resinous. When the amount is less than 10 pbw, little or no improvement in high-temperature compression set due to the addition of the polyphenylene ether resin is observed.</p><p num="p0021">Modified PPO is also contemplated in the invention. It is formed by modi-fying the above-mentioned PPO with a modifier. As the modifier used for modifying the PPO, there is used a compound having an ethylenic double bond and a polar group in the same molecule, which is specifically exemplified by maleic anhydride, maleic acid, maleic acid ester, maleimide, N-substituted compounds thereof, acrylic acid, acrylic acid ester, methacrylic acid, methacrylic acid ester, and glycidyl methacrylate, among which maleic anhydride is preferred.</p><p num="p0022">The use of a substantially amorphous polyolefin such as EPR or hydrogenated polydienes as component (c) helps to provide soft and rubberlike compositions. EPR useful in the blends of this invention are substantially amorphous having ciystallinity of less than 10 weight percent. The EPR is formed from copolymerized monomers of ethylene, olefins, e.g., propylene, and, optionally, known vinyl modifiers, e.g., 1,4-hexadiene and 5-ethyldiene, and 2-norbornene. The weight average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) ofthese EPR polymers (using polystyrene standards) typically ranges from about 5,000 to about 60,000. EPR can be prepared by procedures known in the art, and certain EPR polymers are available commercially from, for example, Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and Uniroyal Chemical Co. (Akron, Ohio). Suitable hydrogenated polydienes include but are not limited to hydrogenated polyisoprene and hydrogenated vinyl polybutadiene, although any

polymerized hydrogenated conjugated diene having a M<sub>w</sub> from about 5,000 to about 60,000 is suitable for use in the present invention.</p><p num="p0023">These olefinic polymers, copolymers, terpolymers, tetrapolymers, etc., are readily prepared using soluble Ziegler-Natta catalyst compositions. Suitable polyolefins may be prepared in either batch or continuous reactor systems, in gas phase, solution or slurry polymerizations. In particular, effective use can be made of a tubular reactor system to achieve novel molecular composition and molecular weight distribution. In common with all Ziegler-Natta polymerizations, monomers, solvents, and catalyst components, are dried and freed from moisture, oxygen, or other constituents which are known to be liarmful to the activity of the catalyst system. Feed tanks, lines and reactors may be protected by blanketing with an inert dry gas such as purified N<sub>2</sub>. Chain propagation retarders or stoppers, such as H<sub>2</sub> and anhydrous HC1, may be fed continuously or intermittently, to any but a tubular reactor, for the purpose of controlling the molecular weight and/or molecular weight distribution

 the desired limits. Additionally, as described above, it is known to incorporate branch suppressors such as certain Lewis Bases, e.g., NH<sub>3</sub>, and certain silicates, during the EPDM polymerization to reduce branching.</p><p num="p0024">The amount of EPR is 10 to 500 pbw, preferably 100 to 400 pbw, based on 100 pbw hydrogenated block copolymer. If the amount of EPR is less than 10 pbw, the resulting product becomes resin-like, increases its hardness, and loses its flexibility. Additionally, the product itself can be considered not to be economical due to a small quantity in the use of cheap softening agent. If EPR is blended in a range of 10 to 400 pbw, a composition superior in the high-temperature (100°C) compression set can be obtained. - - The compatibilizer may serve to eliminate any- difficulty ascribed to obtaining a homogeneous mixture of the non-oil polymeric softener with the hydrogenated block copolymer and PPO blend. With the use of the compatibilizer the process may be conducted on a larger scale than had previously been allowed. The compatibilizer allows the polymer to obtain a desired degree of dispersion with reduced gross separation of components. The gels used in conjunction with the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
compatibilizer consistently obtain compression set values less than 65% in bulk quantities.</p><p num="p0025">Optionally, a grafting agent with at least 2 organic functional groups, such as a peroxide can be added during the blending of the above-described components. The grafting agent generally is added in amounts ranging from 1 to 5 pbw based on</p><p num="p0026">100 pbw hydrogenated block copolymer and further promotes the process of obtaining a thorough mixture. Peroxides graft the components of the mixture together, further reducing the immiscibility, promoting adhesion, and reducing the interfacial tension of the components allowing for the generation of a thoroughly homogeneous mixture. All components of the blend are susceptible to attack by the free radicals generated by the grafting agents. Peroxide grafting agents that are stable at 25 °C are particularly useful, such as di-t-butyl peroxide.</p><p num="p0027">Suitable compatibilizers are vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon/ conjugated diene diblock polymers. The diblock polymer contains 5 to 50% by weight of vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon contributed monomers and 95 to 50% by weight of conjugated diene contributed monomers. Particularly useful monomers for this purpose are vinyl-aryl and methylvinyl-aryl compounds such as styrene, methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl naphthalene, methylvinyl toluene, vinyl diphenyl, and corresponding compounds in which the aromatic nucleus may have other alkyl derivatives up to a total of 8 carbon atoms. Commonly utilized conjugated diolefin monomers include isoprene, 1,3-butadiene, 2,3 -dimethyl- 1,3- butadiene, piperylene, 3-butyl-l,3-octadiene, and or 2-phenyl-l,3-butadiene. In a preferred embodiment, the diblock is a butadiene/styrene diblock polymer. The M<sub>w</sub> of the diblock polymer preferably is from about 25,000 to about 200,000. - - Frequently, other additives -mown in the art can be added to the --. composition of the present invention. Stabilizers, antioxidants, conventional fillers, reinforcing agents, reinforcing resins, pigments, fragrances and the like are examples of some such additives. Useful antioxidants and stabilizers include 2,2- hydroxy-5-methylphenyl, benzotriazole, nickel dibutyldithiocarbamate, zinc dibutyl dithiocarbamate, tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite, and 2,6-dibutyl-4-methylphenol.</p><p num="p0028">Examples of granular or powdery filler include talc, carbon black, graphite, TiO<sub>2</sub>,

silica, mica, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, BaCO<sub>3</sub>, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, BaSO , tin oxide, alumina, kaolin, silicon carbide, metallic powder, glass powder, glass flake and glass bead. These compounding ingredients are incorporated in suitable amounts depending upon the contemplated use of the product, preferably in the range of 1 to 350 pbw additives or compounding ingredients per 100 pbw soft gel.</p><p num="p0029">A reinforcement may be defined as the material that is added to a resinous matrix to improve the strength of the soft gel. Most of these reinforcing materials are inorganic or organic products of high molecular weight. Various examples include glass fibers, asbestos, boron fibers, carbon, and graphite fibers, whiskers, quartz and silica fibers, ceramic fibers, metal fibers, natural organic fibers, and synthetic organic fibers. Other elastomers and resins are also useful to enhance specific properties like damping properties, adhesion, and processability. Examples of other elastomers and resins include adhesive-like products such as Reostomer (Riken- Vinyl Inc.), hydrogenated polystyrene- (medium or high) 3,4-polyisopene- polystyrene block copolymers such as Hybler (produced by Kurare Inc.), polynorbornenes such as Norsorex (produced by Nippon Zion Inc.) and the like.</p><p num="p0030">The above-mentioned filler is preferably surface treated. The coupling agent to be used for the surface treatment is to improve adhesion between the filler and composition, and may be optionally selected for use from the well-known silane- based coupling agents and titanium-based coupling agents. Examples of preferably usable coupling agents among them include aminosilane such as di-aminopropyl- trimethoxysilane, N-bis-(aminoethyl) diaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, glycidoxy- propyltrimethoxysilane and bis-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyltrimethoxysilane, epoxysilane, isopropyltriaminoethyl titanate, and the like. — A second softening agent may be added to further decrease the hardness of the composition. Paraffin oil or similar non-aromatic oil can be added at a level of no more than 25 pbw per 100 pbw soft gel.</p><p num="p0031">Soft gels generally have low to high damping properties having a tan δ in the range of about 0.1 to about 1.0, and a Shore A hardness ranging from 0 to about 50, preferably about 1 to about 30, most preferably about 5 to 20 at about 20 to</p><p num="p0032">25°C or at room temperature. The service temperature of the soft gels of the

present invention is less than or equal to 150°C for most of the blends of polymers of the present invention, e.g., 100°C compression set of the soft gel is less than 65% while the 70°C compression set is less than 50% and preferably less than 30%.</p><p num="p0033">Soft gel compositions may be prepared by any means well known in the art for combining such ingredients, such as solution blending, milling, internal batch mixing, or continuous extrusion of a solid form of the soft gel compositions and the other ingredients. A rapid and convenient method of preparation comprises heating a mixture of the components to a temperature of about 50° to about 290°C preferably holding the composition above its melting point for a few minutes up to several hours, e.g. 15-60 minutes. As for the mixing equipment, any conventional, generally known equipment such as an open-type mixing roll, closed-type Banbury mixer, extruding machine, kneader, continuous mixer, etc., is acceptable. The closed-type is preferable, and mixing in an inactive gas environment, such as N<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>, is also preferable. The composition obtained using the manufacturing method of this invention can be molded with equipment conventionally used for molding thermoplastics and is suitable for extrusion molding, calendar molding, and particularly injection molding. These compositions can also be solution mixed in appropriate solvent, e.g., cyclohexane or toluene. The compositions of the present invention are favorably used in the manufacturing of any product in which the following properties are advantageous: a high degree of softness, heat resistance, decent mechanical properties, and elasticity. The compositions of the present invention can be used in all industry fields, in particular, in the fabrication of automotive parts, household electrical appliances, industrial machinery, precision instruments, transport machinery, constructions, engineering, and medical instruments. Since the present compositions can be used to control the release of internal low molecular weight materials out from the compositions, it is useful as a release support to emit materials such as fragrance materials, medical materials and other fiinctional materials. The compositions of the present invention also possess utility in applications of use in liquid crystals, adhesive materials and coating materials.

 The present invention now will be described in more detail with reference to the following non-limiting example. A polymer was prepared by combining at a temperature of 190°C a charge comprised of 21 g Xyron™ X0101 (Asahi Kasei: Tokyo, Japan) composed of 70% (by wt.) poly(2,6-dimethyl-l,4-phenylene ether) and 30% by weight of high-impact polystyrene with 14 g butadiene/styrene diblock</p><p num="p0034">(33% by weight styrene, M<sub>n</sub> = 54,600) at 90 rpm for 10 minutes. A further charge of 14 g isotactic polypropylene (Aldrich) was added and mixed for 5 minutes at 90 rpm. The resultant plastic material was removed and cut into 0.50 cm pieces while hot. At 190°C, 70 pbw of the plastic material prepared above was mixed at 60-</p><p num="p0035">90 rpm with 100 pbw hydrogenated medium vinyl SEBS (Kuraray Co.; Tokyo, Japan, #S8006, M<sub>w</sub> = 215,000, 33% by weight styrene) and 190 pbw EPR (Aldrich) having a M<sub>w</sub> of 21,300 (polystyrene standards) and a T<sub>g</sub> of -33°C. The copolymer was added to the mixture in five increments over the course of 30 to 45 minutes. At a temperature less than 50°C, 0.6 to 1.0 pbw di-t-butyl peroxide (Aldrich) was mixed with the blended product produced above at 30 rpm as the compound is heated to 190°C over 20 minutes. The resultant compound was maintained at 190°C for 10 minutes and then cooled.</p><p num="p0036">Following cooling, the compound was molded at 200°C for 5 minutes resulting in a compound displaying a Shore A of 24, Asker C of 52, and a Compression Set (C.S.) @ 100°C of 43%.
