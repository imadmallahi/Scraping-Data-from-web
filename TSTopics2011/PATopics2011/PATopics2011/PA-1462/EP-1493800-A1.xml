compositions, which is at least one, at least partially hydrogenated linear or star-shaped
random copolymer of isoprene and butadiene, in which at least 70 wt. % of the
butadiene is incorporated into the polymer as 1, 4 units and the weight ratio of
isoprene addition product to butadiene addition product in the copolymer is in a range
of from about 90: 10 to about 70:30.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The invention is directed to polymers suitable for use as viscosity index
improvers for lubricating oil compositions, and to lubricating oil compositions
containing the defined polymers. More specifically, the present invention is directed
to certain linear, radial and star-shaped random copolymers of isoprene and butadiene,
block copolymers wherein at least one block is a random copolymer of isoprene and
butadiene; and to lubricating oil compositions containing the defined copolymers.</p><p num="0002">Lubricating oils for use in crankcase engine oils contain components that are
used to improve the viscometric performance of the engine oil, i.e., to provide
multigrade oils such as SAE 5W-30, 10W-30 and 10W-40. These viscosity
performance enhancers, commonly referred to as viscosity index (VI) improvers
include olefin copolymers, polymethacrylates, styrene/hydrogenated diene block and
star copolymers and hydrogenated isoprene star polymers.</p><p num="0003">Olefin copolymers (or OCP) used as viscosity index improvers conventionally
comprise copolymers of ethylene, propylene and, optionally, a diene. Small
polymeric side chains do not exert a substantial viscosity modifying effect in oil.
Polymerized propylene has one methyl branch for every two backbone carbon atoms.
Ethylene polymer is substantially straight chained. Therefore, at a constant amount of
polymer in oil (treat rate), an OCP having a higher ethylene content will display an
increased high temperature thickening effect (thickening efficiency, or TE). However,
polymer chains having long ethylene sequences have a more crystalline polymer
structure. Crystalline polymers are less oil soluble than amorphous polymers and as a
result, the OCP can drop out of the oil, causing the plugging of engine filters (and the
loss of the viscosity modifying effect). Further, OCPs having substantial crystalline
segments have been found, again primarily at low temperatures, to interact with
waxes in the oil, and other OCP chains, which results in uncontrollable increases in
low temperature viscosity and, in extreme cases, the gelling of the lubricating oil.
These problems have been found to manifest in Ziegler Natta polymerized OCPs 
containing greater than about 60 wt.% ethylene (hereinafter referred to as "high
ethylene content OCP(s)").</p><p num="0004">Due to their molecular architecture, star polymers are known to provide
improved shear stability compared to OCPs. VI improvers that are star polymers
made by hydrogenation of anionically polymerized isoprene are commercially
available. Anionic polymerization results in a relatively low molecular weight
distribution (Mw/Mn). Hydrogenation results in alternating ethylene/propylene units
having a composition comparable to a polymer derived from 40 wt.% ethylene and 60
wt.% propylene. These VI improvers provide excellent shear stability, good solubility
and excellent cold temperature properties. However, improvements in the balance
between the thickening efficiency and shear stability of star polymers remain possible.</p><p num="0005">U.S. Patent No. 4,116,917 exemplifies certain star polymers comprising
hydrogenated poly(butadiene/isoprene) tapered arms containing about 44.3 wt.%
polymer derived from butadiene. Since butadiene initially reacts faster than isoprene
when anionic polymerization is initiated with secondary butyllithium (the process
described in the patent), a polybutadiene block is first formed. As the butadiene
concentration is lowered through polymerization, isoprene begins to add to the living
polymer so that, when the polymerization reaction is complete, the chain is made up
of a polybutadiene block, a tapered segment containing both butadiene and isoprene
addition product, and a polyisoprene block resulting in a living tapered polymer
chains that, when coupled with divinylbenzene, produce a star polymer having a
polybutadiene block positioned distal from the divinylbenzene-coupled core. The long
ethylene sequences of these external hydrogenated polybutadiene blocks were found
to cause the same low temperature performance problems associated with high
ethylene content OCPs.</p><p num="0006">To provide an improvement in thickening efficiency, while maintaining low
temperature performance, U.S. Patent No. 5,460,739 suggests star polymers
comprising triblock copolymer arms of hydrogenated polyisoprene/ polybutadiene/
polyisoprene. The hydrogenated polybutadiene block provides an increased ethylene
content, which improves thickening efficiency. The patent suggests that, by placing 
the hydrogenated polybutadiene block more proximal to the nucleus, the adverse
effect on low temperature properties could be minimized. Such polymers were found
to provide improved low temperature properties relative to the tapered arm polymers
of U.S. Patent No. 4,116,917. However, when such polymers were provided with a
hydrogenated polybutadiene block of a size sufficient to provide a credit in thickening
efficiency, a debit in low temperature performance remained relative to the pure
polyisoprene polymers.</p><p num="0007">Therefore, there remains a need for improved VI improvers that are capable of
providing a TE comparable to that of high ethylene content OCP, without the
associated reduction in solubility and cold temperature performance.</p><p num="0008">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a class of
polymers suitable for use as viscosity index improvers for lubricating oil
compositions, which polymers comprise hydrogenated linear, radial and star-shaped
random copolymers of isoprene and butadiene, wherein at least 70 wt. % of the
butadiene is incorporated into the polymer as 1, 4 units and the weight ratio of
isoprene addition product to butadiene addition product is in the range of from about
90: 10 to about 70:30, preferably from about 85:15 to about 80:20.</p><p num="0009">In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a
copolymer, as in the first aspect, in the form of a linear or radial, preferably a linear
copolymer, preferably having a number average molecular weight of from about
10,000 to 700,000, more preferably from about 50,000 to 200,000.</p><p num="0010">In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a
copolymer, as in the first aspect, in the form of a star polymer containing from about 5
to 25 arms, preferably from about 15 to 20 arms, wherein each arm preferably has a
number average molecular weight of from about 10,000 to 300,000, more preferably
from about 40,000 to 140,000.</p><p num="0011">In accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a diblock
copolymer comprising a first block derived from monoalkenyl arene, preferably 
styrene, and a second block comprising a linear polymer, as in the second aspect,
wherein the number average molecular weight of the diblock copolymer is preferably
from about 10,000 to 700,000, more preferably from about 50,000 to 250,000.</p><p num="0012">In accordance with a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a
lubricating oil composition comprising a major amount of oil of lubricating viscosity,
and a copolymer as in any of the first, second, third and fourth aspect, in an amount
effective to modify the viscosity index of the lubricating oil composition.</p><p num="0013">In accordance with a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method
of modifying the viscosity index of a lubricating oil composition comprising a major
amount of oil of lubricating viscosity, which method comprises adding to said oil of
lubricating viscosity an effective amount of a copolymer as in any of the first, second,
third and fourth aspect.</p><p num="0014">In accordance with a seventh aspect of the invention, there is provided the use
of a copolymer of any of the first, second, third and fourth aspect to modify the
viscosity index of a lubricating oil composition.</p><p num="0015">Isoprene monomers that may be used as the precursors of the copolymers of
the present invention can be incorporated into the polymer as either 1,4- or 3,4-configuration
units, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the majority of the isoprene is
incorporated into the polymer as 1,4-units, such as greater than about 60 wt.%, more
preferably greater than about 80 wt.%, such as about 80 to 100 wt.%, most preferably
greater than about 90 wt.%., such as about 93 wt.% to 100 wt.%.</p><p num="0016">Butadiene monomers that may be used as the precursors of the copolymers of
the present invention can be incorporated into the polymer as either as either 1,2- or
1,4-configuration units. In the polymers of the present invention, at least about 70
wt. %, such as at least about 75 wt. %, preferably at least about 80 wt. %, such as at
least about 85 wt. %, more preferably at least about 90, such as 95 to 100 wt. %, of
the butadiene is incorporated into the polymer as 1,4 units. </p><p num="0017">Useful copolymers include those prepared in bulk, suspension, solution or
emulsion. As is well known, polymerization of monomers to produce hydrocarbon
polymers may be accomplished using free-radical, cationic and anionic initiators or
polymerization catalysts, such as transition metal catalysts used for Ziegler-Natta and
metallocene type catalysts. Preferably, the random copolymers of the present
invention are formed via anionic polymerization as anionic polymerization has been
found to provide copolymers having a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn),
such as a molecular weight distribution of less than about 1.2. Most preferably, the
random copolymers of the present invention are formed by polymerizing a mixture of
the isoprene and butadiene monomers, in solution, in the presence of an anionic
initiator, to form a living polymer.</p><p num="0018">As is well known, and disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,116,917,
living polymers may be prepared by anionic solution polymerization of a mixture of
the conjugated diene monomers in the presence of an alkali metal or an alkali metal
hydrocarbon, e.g., sodium naphthalene, as anionic initiator. The preferred initiator is
lithium or a monolithium hydrocarbon. Suitable lithium hydrocarbons include
unsaturated compounds such as allyl lithium, methallyl lithium; aromatic compounds
such as phenyllithium, the tolyllithiums, the xylyllithiums and the naphthyllithiums,
and in particular, the alkyl lithiums such as methyllithium, ethyllithium, propyllithium,
butyllithium, amyllithium, hexyllithium, 2-ethylhexyllithium and n-hexadecyllithium.
Secondary-butyllithium is the preferred initiator. The initiator(s) may be added to the
polymerization mixture in two or more stages, optionally together with additional
monomer. The living polymers are olefinically unsaturated.</p><p num="0019">The living random copolymers may be represented by the formula A-M,
wherein M is a carbanionic group, i.e., lithium, and A is a random copolymer of
polyisoprene and polybutadiene. As noted <i>supra</i>, in the absence of the proper control
of the polymerization, the resulting copolymer will not be a random copolymer and
will instead comprise a polybutadiene block, a tapered segment containing both
butadiene and isoprene addition product, and a polyisoprene block. To prepare a
random copolymer, the more reactive butadiene monomer may be added gradually to
the polymerization reaction mixture containing the less reactive isoprene such that the 
molar ratio of the monomers in the polymerization mixture is maintained at the
required level. It is also possible to achieve the required randomization by gradually
adding a mixture of the monomers to be copolymerized to the polymerization mixture.
Living random copolymers may also be prepared by carrying out the polymerization
in the presence of a so-called randomizer. Randomizers are polar compounds that do
not deactivate the catalyst and randomize the manner in which the monomers are
incorporated into to the polymer chain. Suitable randomizers are tertiary amines, such
as trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-butylamine,
dimethylaniline, pyridine, quinoline, N-ethyl-piperidine, N-methylmorpholine;
thioethers, such as dimethyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide, di-n-propyl sulfide, di-n-butyl
sulfide, methyl ethyl sulfide; and in particular, ethers such as dimethyl ether, methyl
ether, diethyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, di-octyl ether, di-benzyl ether,
di-phenyl ether, anisole, 1,2-dimethyloxyethane, o-dimethyloxy benzene, and cyclic
ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran.</p><p num="0020">Even with controlled monomer addition and/or the use of a randomizer, the
initial and terminal portions of the polymer chains may have greater than a "random"
amount of polymer derived from the more reactive and less reactive monomer,
respectively. Therefore, for the purpose of this invention, the term "random
copolymer" means a polymer chain, or a polymer block, the preponderance of which
(greater than 80%, preferably greater than 90%, such as greater than 95%) results
from the random addition of comonomer materials.</p><p num="0021">The solvents in which the living polymers are formed are inert liquid solvents,
such as hydrocarbons e.g., aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane,
oc
tane, 2-ethylhexane, nonane, decane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, or aromatic
hydrocarbons e.g., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, the xylenes, diethylbenzenes,
propylbenzenes. Cyclohexane is preferred. Mixtures of hydrocarbons e.g.,
lubricating oils, may also be used.</p><p num="0022">The temperature at which the polymerization is conducted may be varied
within a wide range, such as from about -50°C to about 150°C, preferably from about 
as nitrogen, and may optionally be carried out under pressure e.g., a pressure of from
about 0.5 to about 10 bars.</p><p num="0023">The concentration of the initiator used to prepare the living polymer may also
vary within a wide range and is determined by the desired molecular weight of the
living polymer.</p><p num="0024">Where a star polymer is desired, the living polymers formed via the foregoing
process may be reacted in an additional reaction step, with a polyalkenyl coupling
agent. Polyalkenyl coupling agents capable of forming star polymers have been
known for a number of years and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No.
3,985,830. Polyalkenyl coupling agents are conventionally compounds having at
least two non-conjugated alkenyl groups. Such groups are usually attached to the
same or different electron-withdrawing moiety e.g. an aromatic nucleus. Such
compounds have the property that at least of the alkenyl groups are capable of
independent reaction with different living polymers and in this respect are different
from conventional conjugated diene polymerizable monomers such as butadiene,
isoprene, etc. Pure or technical grade polyalkenyl coupling agents may be used. Such
compounds may be aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic. Examples of aliphatic
compounds include the polyvinyl and polyallyl acetylene, diacetylenes, phosphates
and phosphates as well as dimethacrylates, e.g. ethylene dimethylacrylate. Examples
of suitable heterocyclic compounds include divinyl pyridine and divinyl thiophene.</p><p num="0025">The preferred coupling agents are the polyalkenyl aromatic compounds and
most preferred are the polyvinyl aromatic compounds. Examples of such compounds
include those aromatic compounds, e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, anthracene,
naphthalene and durene, which are substituted with at least two alkenyl groups,
preferably attached directly thereto. Specific examples include the polyvinyl
benzenes e.g. divinyl, trivinyl and tetravinyl benzenes; divinyl, trivinyl and tetravinyl
ortho-, meta- and para-xylenes, divinyl naphthalene, divinyl ethyl benzene, divinyl
biphenyl, diisobutenyl benzene, diisopropenyl benzene, and diisopropenyl biphenyl.
The preferred aromatic compounds are those represented by the formula A-(CH=CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x</sub>
wherein A is an optionally substituted aromatic nucleus and x is an 
integer of at least 2. Divinyl benzene, in particular meta-divinyl benzene, is the most
preferred aromatic compound. Pure or technical grade divinyl benzene (containing
other monomers e.g. styrene and ethyl styrene) may be used. The coupling agents
may be used in admixture with small amounts of added monomers which increase the
size of the nucleus, e.g. styrene or alkyl styrene. In such a case, the nucleus can be
described as a poly(dialkenyl coupling agent/monoalkenyl aromatic compound)
nucleus, e.g. a poly(divinylbenzene/monoalkenyl aromatic compound) nucleus.</p><p num="0026">The polyalkenyl coupling agent should be added to the living polymer after
the polymerization of the monomers is substantially complete, i.e. the agent should be
added only after substantially all the monomer has been converted to the living
polymers.</p><p num="0027">The amount of polyalkenyl coupling agent added may vary within a wide
range, but preferably, at least 0.5 mole of the coupling agent is used per mole of
unsaturated living polymer. Amounts of from about 1 to about 15 moles, preferably
from about 1.5 to about 5 moles per mole of living polymer are preferred. The
amount, which can be added in two or more stages, is usually an amount sufficient to
convert at least about 80 wt.% to 85 wt.% of the living polymer into star-shaped
polymer.</p><p num="0028">The coupling reaction can be carried out in the same solvent as the living
polymerization reaction. The coupling reaction can be carried out at temperatures
within a broad range, such as from 0°C to 150°C, preferably from about 20°C to about
120°C. The reaction may be conducted in an inert atmosphere, e.g. nitrogen, and
under pressure of from about 0.5 bar to about 10 bars.</p><p num="0029">The star-shaped polymers thus formed are characterized by a dense center or
nucleus of crosslinked poly(polyalkenyl coupling agent) and a number of arms of
substantially linear unsaturated polymers extending outward from the nucleus. The
number of arms may vary considerably, but is typically between about 4 and 25. </p><p num="0030">The resulting linear or star-shaped copolymers can then be hydrogenated using
any suitable means. A hydrogenation catalyst may be used e.g. a copper or
molybdenum compound. Catalysts containing noble metals, or noble metal-containing
compounds, can also be used. Preferred hydrogenation catalysts contain a
non-noble metal or a non-noble metal-containing compound of Group VIII of the
periodic Table i.e., iron, cobalt, and particularly, nickel. Specific examples of
preferred hydrogenation catalysts include Raney nickel and nickel on kieselguhr.
Particularly suitable hydrogenation catalysts are those obtained by causing metal
hydrocarbyl compounds to react with organic compounds of any one of the group
VIII metals iron, cobalt or nickel, the latter compounds containing at least one organic
compound that is attached to the metal atom via an oxygen atom as described, for
example, in U.K. Patent No. 1,030,306. Preference is given to hydrogenation
catalysts obtained by causing an aluminum trialkyl (e.g. aluminum triethyl (Al(Et<sub>3</sub>))
or aluminum triisobutyl) to react with a nickel salt of an organic acid (e.g. nickel
diisopropyl salicylate, nickel naphthenate, nickel 2-ethyl hexanoate, nickel di-tert-butyl
benzoate, nickel salts of saturated monocarboxylic acids obtained by reaction of
olefins having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms in the molecule with carbon monoxide and
water in the presence of acid catalysts) or with nickel enolates or phenolates (e.g.,
nickel acetonylacetonate, the nickel salt of butylacetophenone). Suitable
hydrogenation catalysts will be well known to those skilled in the art and the
foregoing list is by no means intended to be exhaustive.</p><p num="0031">The hydrogenation of the polymers of the present invention is suitably
conducted in solution, in a solvent which is inert during the hydrogenation reaction.
Saturated hydrocarbons and mixtures of saturated hydrocarbons are suitable.
Advantageously, the hydrogenation solvent is the same as the solvent in which
polymerization is conducted. Suitably, at least 50%, preferably at least 70%, more
preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95% of the original olefinic
unsaturation is hydrogenated.</p><p num="0032">The hydrogenated random copolymer may then be recovered in solid form
from the solvent in which it is hydrogenated by any convenient means, such as by
evaporating the solvent. Alternatively, oil e.g. lubricating oil, may be added to the 
solution, and the solvent stripped off from the mixture so formed to provide a
concentrate. Suitable concentrates contain from about 3 wt.% to about 25 wt.%,
preferably from about 5 wt.% to about 15 wt.% of the hydrogenated random
copolymer VI improver.</p><p num="0033">A hydrogeneated linear random polyisoprene/polybutadiene copolymer of the
invention has a weight ratio of polymer derived from isoprene to polymer derived
from butadiene of from about 90:10 to about 70:30, preferably from about 85:15 to

will have a number average molecular weight of from about 10,000 to 700,000,
preferably from about 30,000 to 400,000, more preferably from about 50,000 to about
250,000. The term "number average molecular weight", as used herein, refers to the
number average weight as measured by Gel Permeation Chromatography ("GPC")
with a polystyrene standard, subsequent to hydrogenation. It is important to note that,
when determining the number average molecular weight of a star polymer using this
method, the calculated number average molecular weight will be less than the actual
molecular weight due to the three dimensional structure of the star polymer.</p><p num="0034">The incorporation of additional ethylene units derived from the butadiene
increases the TE of the resulting polymeric VI improver. In fact, due to the properties
of the anionically polymerized polymer, the TE of hydrogenated linear random
polyisoprene/ polybutadiene copolymers of the invention, having an ethylene content
of from about 15 to about 23 wt.% is comparable to that of an OCP VI improver
having an ethylene content of from about 49 wt.% to about 54 wt.%. The TE of VI
improver comprising the hydrogenated random copolymer of the invention is
improved compared to hydrogenated polyisoprene VI improvers. Therefore, less of
the material needs to be used.</p><p num="0035">A hydrogeneated star shaped random polyisoprene/polybutadiene copolymer
of the invention has a weight ratio of polymer derived from isoprene to polymer
derived from butadiene of from about 90:10 to about 70:30, preferably from about
85:15 to about 80:20. Such star-shaped copolymers may comprise from about 4 to
about 25 arms, preferably from about 15 to 20 arms. Preferably each arm is derived 
from a living random polyisoprene/polybutadiene copolymer. Each arm may have a
number average molecular weight of from about 10,000 to about 300,000, preferably
from about 40,000 to about 200,000, more preferably from about 60,000 to about
140,000. VI improvers that are hydrogenated star shaped random polyisoprene/
polybutadiene copolymers of the invention may have an overall number average
molecular weight from about 100,00 to about 2,000,000, preferably from about
300,000 to about 1,200,000, most preferably from about 450,000 to about 800,000.
VI improvers that are hydrogenated random copolymers of the invention will have a

about 30,000 to 400,000, more preferably from about 50,000 to about 250,000.</p><p num="0036">Where the random copolymer is to be a block of a block copolymer, the block
copolymer may be, and is preferably, prepared by step-wise polymerization of the
monomers e.g., polymerizing the random polyisoprene/polybutadiene copolymer,
followed by the addition of the other monomer, specifically monoalkenyl arene
monomer, to form a living polymer having the formula polyisoprene/polybutadiene-polyalkenyl
arene-M. Alternatively, the order can be reversed, and the monoalkenyl
arene block can be polymerized first, followed by the addition of the mixture of
isoprene/butadiene monomer to form a living polymer having the formula
polymonoalkenyl arene-polyisoprene/polybutadiene-M. Suitable monoalkenyl arene
monomers include monovinyl aromatic compounds, such as styrene,
monovinylnaphthalene, as well as the alkylated derivatives thereof, such as o-, m- and
p-methylstyrene, alpha-methyl styrene and tertiary butylstyrene. The preferred
monoalkenyl arene is styrene.</p><p num="0037">In star and linear VI improvers comprising diblocks of styrene and a
hydrogenated random polyisoprene/polybutadiene copolymer of the invention, the
styrene block of the linear diblock copolymer may comprise from about 5 wt.%, to
about 60 wt.%, preferably from about 20 wt.%, to about 50 wt.%, more preferably
from about 30 wt.%, to about 40 wt.%, of the diblock copolymer.</p><p num="0038">The block copolymer may then be hydrogenated and recovered in the same
manner described above. Alternatively, the block copolymer may be selectively 
hydrogenated such that the olefin saturations are hydrogenated as above, while the
aromatic unsaturations are hydrogenated to a lesser extent. Preferably, less than 10%,
more preferably less than 5% of the aromatic unsaturations are hydrogenated.</p><p num="0039">Selective hydrogenation techniques are also well known to those of ordinary
skill in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,595,942, U.S. Re.
Pat. No. 27,145, and U.S. Patent No. 5,166,277.</p><p num="0040">Optionally, the VI improvers of the invention can be provided with nitrogen-containing
functional groups that impart dispersant capabilities to the VI improver.
One trend in the industry has been to use such "multifunctional" VI improvers in
lubricants to replace some or all of the dispersant. Nitrogen-containing functional
groups can be added to a polymeric VI improver by grafting a nitrogen-containing
moiety onto the polymeric backbone of the VI improver. Processes for the grafting of
a nitrogen-containing moiety onto a polymer are known in the art and include, for
example, contacting the polymer and nitrogen-containing moiety in the presence of a
free radical initiator, either neat, or in the presence of a solvent. The free radical
initiator may be generated by shearing (as in an extruder) or heating a free radical
initiator precursor, such as hydrogen peroxide.</p><p num="0041">The amount of nitrogen-containing grafting monomer will depend, to some
extent, on the nature of the substrate polymer and the level of dispersancy required of
the grafted polymer. To impart dispersancy characteristics to both star and linear
copolymers, the amount of grafted nitrogen-containing monomer is suitably between
about 0.4 and about 2.2 wt. %, preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.8 wt. %, most
preferably from about 0.6 to about 1.2 wt. %, based on the total weight of grafted
polymer.</p><p num="0042">Methods for grafting nitrogen-containing monomer onto polymer backbones,

crankcase lubricating oils for passenger car and heavy duty diesel engines, and
comprise a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity, a VI improver as described
above, in an amount effective to modify the viscosity index of the lubricating oil, and
optionally other additives as needed to provide the lubricating oil composition with
the required properties. The lubricating oil composition may contain the VI improver
of the invention in an amount of from about 0.1 wt. % to about 2.5 wt.%, preferably
from about 0.3 wt. % to about 1.5 wt.%, more preferably from about 0.4 wt. % to
about 1.3 wt.%, stated as mass percent active ingredient (AI) in the total lubricating
oil composition. The viscosity index improver of the invention may comprise the
sole VI improver, or may be used in combination with other VI improvers, for
example, in combination with an VI improver comprising polyisobutylene,
copolymers of ethylene and propylene (OCP), polymethacrylates, methacrylate
copolymers, copolymers of an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid and a vinyl compound,
interpolymers of styrene and acrylic esters, and hydrogenated copolymers of styrene/isoprene,
styrene/butadiene, and other hydrogenated isoprene/butadiene copolymers,
as well as the partially hydrogenated homopolymers of butadiene and isoprene.</p><p num="0044">Oils of lubricating viscosity useful in the context of the present invention may
be selected from natural lubricating oils, synthetic lubricating oils and mixtures
thereof. The lubricating oil may range in viscosity from light distillate mineral oils to
heavy lubricating oils such as gasoline engine oils, mineral lubricating oils and heavy
duty diesel oils. Generally, the viscosity of the oil ranges from about 2 centistokes to
about 40 centistokes, especially from about 4 centistokes to about 20 centistokes, as
measured at 100°C. </p><p num="0045">Natural oils include animal oils and vegetable oils (e.g., castor oil, lard oil);
liquid petroleum oils and hydrorefined, solvent-treated or acid-treated mineral oils of
the paraffinic, naphthenic and mixed paraffinic-naphthenic types. Oils of lubricating
viscosity derived from coal or shale also serve as useful base oils.</p><p num="0046">Synthetic lubricating oils include hydrocarbon oils and halo-substituted
hydrocarbon oils such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins (e.g.,
polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propylene-isobutylene copolymers, chlorinated
polybutylenes, poly(1-hexenes), poly(1-octenes), poly(1-decenes)); alkylbenzenes
(e.g., dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di(2-ethylhexyl)benzenes);
polyphenyls (e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated
polyphenols); and alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulfides and
derivative, analogs and homologs thereof.</p><p num="0047">Alkylene oxide polymers and interpolymers and derivatives thereof where the
terminal hydroxyl groups have been modified by esterification, etherification, etc.,
constitute another class of known synthetic lubricating oils. These are exemplified by
polyoxyalkylene polymers prepared by polymerization of ethylene oxide or propylene
oxide, and the alkyl and aryl ethers of polyoxyalkylene polymers (e.g., methyl-polyiso-propylene
glycol ether having a molecular weight of 1000 or diphenyl ether
of poly-ethylene glycol having a molecular weight of 1000 to 1500); and mono- and
polycarboxylic esters thereof, for example, the acetic acid esters, mixed C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>8</sub> fatty
acid esters and C<sub>13</sub> oxo acid diester of tetraethylene glycol.</p><p num="0048">Another suitable class of synthetic lubricating oils comprises the esters of
dicarboxylic acids (e.g., phthalic acid, succinic acid, alkyl succinic acids and alkenyl
succinic acids, maleic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebasic acid, fumaric acid,
adipic acid, linoleic acid dimer, malonic acid, alkylmalonic acids, alkenyl malonic
acids) with a variety of alcohols (e.g., butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol,
2-ethylhexyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoether, propylene glycol).
Specific examples of such esters includes dibutyl adipate, di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate,
di-n-hexyl fumarate, dioctyl sebacate, diisooctyl azelate, diisodecyl azelate, dioctyl
phthalate, didecyl phthalate, dieicosyl sebacate, the 2-ethylhexyl diester of linoleic 
acid dimer, and the complex ester formed by reacting one mole of sebacic acid with
two moles of tetraethylene glycol and two moles of 2-ethylhexanoic acid.</p><p num="0049">Esters useful as synthetic oils also include those made from C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>12</sub>
monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyol esters such as neopentyl glycol,
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol and tripentaerythritol.</p><p num="0050">Silicon-based oils such as the polyalkyl-, polyaryl-, polyalkoxy- or
polyaryloxysilicone oils and silicate oils comprise another useful class of synthetic
lubricants; such oils include tetraethyl silicate, tetraisopropyl silicate, tetra-(2-ethylhexyl)silicate,
tetra-(4-methyl-2-ethylhexyl)silicate, tetra-(p-tert-butyl-phenyl)
silicate, hexa-(4-methyl-2-ethylhexyl)disiloxane, poly(methyl)siloxanes and
poly(methylphenyl)siloxanes. Other synthetic lubricating oils include liquid esters of
phosphorous-containing acids (e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, diethyl
ester of decylphosphonic acid) and polymeric tetrahydrofurans.</p><p num="0051">Ashless dispersants maintain in suspension oil insolubles resulting from
oxidation of the oil during wear or combustion. They are particularly advantageous
for preventing the precipitation of sludge and the formation of varnish, particularly in
gasoline engines.</p><p num="0052">When the VI improver of the present invention is replaced by a nitrogen-functionalized
equivalent thereof, the amount of ashless dispersant in the formulation
can be decreased by at about 25 percent depending upon the amount of dispersant-viscosity
index improver (DVII) used in the oil composition.</p><p num="0053">Metal-containing or ash-forming detergents function both as detergents to
reduce or remove deposits and as acid neutralizers or rust inhibitors, thereby reducing
wear and corrosion and extending engine life. Detergents generally comprise a polar
head with a long hydrophobic tail, with the polar head comprising a metal salt of an
acidic organic compound. The salts may contain a substantially stoichiometric
amount of the metal in which case they are usually described as normal or neutral
salts, and would typically have a total base number or TBN (as can be measured by 
ASTM D2896) of from 0 to 80. A large amount of a metal base may be incorporated
by reacting excess metal compound (e.g., an oxide or hydroxide) with an acidic gas
(e.g., carbon dioxide). The resulting overbased detergent comprises neutralized
detergent as the outer layer of a metal base (e.g. carbonate) micelle. Such overbased
detergents may have a TBN of 150 or greater, and typically will have a TBN of from
250 to 450 or more.</p><p num="0054">Dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphate metal salts are frequently used as antiwear and
antioxidant agents. The metal may be an alkali or alkaline earth metal, or aluminum,
lead, tin, molybdenum, manganese, nickel or copper. The zinc salts are most
commonly used in lubricating oil and may be prepared in accordance with known
techniques by first forming a dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphoric acid (DDPA), usually
by reaction of one or more alcohol or a phenol with P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> and then neutralizing the
formed DDPA with a zinc compound. For example, a dithiophosphoric acid may be
made by reacting mixtures of primary and secondary alcohols. Alternatively, multiple
dithiophosphoric acids can be prepared where the hydrocarbyl groups on one are
entirely secondary in character and the hydrocarbyl groups on the others are entirely
primary in character. To make the zinc salt, any basic or neutral zinc compound
could be used but the oxides, hydroxides and carbonates are most generally employed.
Commercial additives frequently contain an excess of zinc due to the use of an excess
of the basic zinc compound in the neutralization reaction.</p><p num="0055">Oxidation inhibitors or antioxidants reduce the tendency of mineral oils to
deteriorate in service. Oxidative deterioration can be evidenced by sludge in the
lubricant, varnish-like deposits on the metal surfaces, and by viscosity growth. Such
oxidation inhibitors include hindered phenols, alkaline earth metal salts of
alkylphenolthioesters having preferably C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>12</sub> alkyl side chains, calcium
nonylphenol sulfide, oil soluble phenates and sulfurized phenates, phosphosulfurized
or sulfurized hydrocarbons, phosphorous esters, metal thiocarbamates, oil soluble
copper compounds as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,867,890, and molybdenum-containing
compounds and aromatic amines. </p><p num="0056">Known friction modifiers include oil-soluble organo-molybdenum compounds.
Such organo-molybdenum friction modifiers also provide antioxidant and antiwear
credits to a lubricating oil composition. As an example of such oil soluble organo-molybdenum
compounds, there may be mentioned the dithiocarbamates,
dithiophosphates, dithiophosphinates, xanthates, thioxanthates, sulfides, and the like, and
mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred are molybdenum dithiocarbamates,
dialkyldithiophosphates, alkyl xanthates and alkylthioxanthates.</p><p num="0057">Other known friction modifying materials include glyceryl monoesters of
higher fatty acids, for example, glyceryl mono-oleate; esters of long chain
polycarboxylic acids with diols, for example, the butane diol ester of a dimerized
unsaturated fatty acid; oxazoline compounds; and alkoxylated alkyl-substituted monoamines,
diamines and alkyl ether amines, for example, ethoxylated tallow amine and
ethoxylated tallow ether amine.</p><p num="0058">Pour point depressants, otherwise known as lube oil flow improvers (LOFI),
lower the minimum temperature at which the fluid will flow or can be poured. Such
additives are well known. Typical of those additives that improve the low
temperature fluidity of the fluid are C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>18</sub> dialkyl fumarate/vinyl acetate
copolymers, and polymethacrylates.</p><p num="0059">Foam control can be provided by an antifoamant of the polysiloxane type, for
example, silicone oil or polydimethyl siloxane.</p><p num="0060">Some of the above-mentioned additives can provide a multiplicity of effects;
thus for example, a single additive may act as a dispersant-oxidation inhibitor. This
approach is well known and need not be further elaborated herein.</p><p num="0061">It may also be necessary to include an additive which maintains the stability of
the viscosity of the blend. Thus, although polar group-containing additives achieve a
suitably low viscosity in the pre-blending stage it has been observed that some
compositions increase in viscosity when stored for prolonged periods. Additives
which are effective in controlling this viscosity increase include the long chain 
hydrocarbons functionalized by reaction with mono- or dicarboxylic acids or
anhydrides which are used in the preparation of the ashless dispersants as
hereinbefore disclosed.</p><p num="0062">Representative effective amounts of such additional additives, when used in

tested for low temperature viscometrics performance. For the double-length IIIF test,
passage requires that used oil, low temperature viscometrics, particularly CCS and
MRV-TP1, cannot deteriorate over one W grade. To pass the Mack T-10A test,
MRV-TP1 viscosity of the used oil cannot exceed 25,000 mPas (cP) with no yield

As shown by the data of Table 4, with the lubricating oil containing Inv. 1 as the VII,
MRV-TP1 viscosity increases linearly with kv<sub>40</sub> and MRV -TP1 exceeds the
maximum limit (60,000 mPas (cP)) at a point at which kv<sub>40</sub> had risen to about 120%.
For the oil blended with the high-ethylene VII (Comp. 4), MRV-TP1 viscosity
deteriorates much faster than kv<sub>40</sub>, and increases above 60,000 mPas (cP) at a point
corresponding to a kv<sub>40</sub> increase of only about 85%. Therefore, it can be shown that
the used oil low temperature viscometrics for the VI improvers of the invention are
superior to those of high-ethylene content OCPs.</p><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLE 4</u></heading><p num="0081">For HDD formulations, passage of the Mack T-10A test is the only used oil
