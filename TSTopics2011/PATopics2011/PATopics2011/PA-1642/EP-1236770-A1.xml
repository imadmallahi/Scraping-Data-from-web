polymer composition in for example, rotational moulding
as well as to the polymer composition itself, to
rotomoulding processes using the same and to rotomoulded
articles made from the polymer composition. More
specifically, the invention concerns the use of a
polymer composition which comprises at least two
components formed by single site catalysis having
particular molecular weight distributions, comonomer
compositions and densities.</p><p num="0002">Rotational moulding is a moulding process in which
a particulate polymer, the moulding powder, is filled
into a mould which is placed into an oven and rotated so
that the polymer melts and coats the inside surface of
the mould. In order to ensure that the moulded product
is defect free, the moulding powder must have a
relatively small particle size and should preferably be
uniform in particle size and composition. Where, as is
normal, the moulding powder has to contain colouring
agents or other additives, e.g. stabilisers, the
moulding powder is conventionally produced by grinding
polymer pellets extruded from stabilised reactor grain
powder to the correct particle size for rotation of
moulding, usually this the colours or other additives
being added in with the polymer pellets are mixed into
the ground and moulding powder.</p><p num="0003">A wide variety of articles may be prepared by
rotational moulding. In particular rotational moulding
is used in the manufacture of large objects such as
liquid containers, e.g. tanks, boats, as well as in a
large number of household areas, e.g. in the manufacture
of toys.</p><p num="0004">The nature of the polymer rotomoulded depends very
much on the nature of the article to be made. For 
example, if a chemical tank is being made, then the
polymer used should be one which is not degraded by the
chemical and one which has particular mechanical
properties so that the container does not break under
stress. Polymers used for the manufacture of toys must
be completely non-toxic and again must be strong to
prevent breakage. Articles for outdoor use such as
boats must also be resistant to degradation from by the
elements, e.g. sunlight, rain, frost or seawater. The
mechanical properties of the rotomoulding powders are
therefore critical.</p><p num="0005">Another important property is rheology and it is
also critical that this is favourable. Rheology is a
measure of non-Newtonian solid flow and it is crucial
that flow be within certain limits to ensure that
product properties are ideal.</p><p num="0006">Moreover, when making objects where a well defined
shape is required, it is also desired that the eventual
rotomoulded product does not warp, i.e. that the sides
of a product remain undistorted.</p><p num="0007">A variety of polymers may be successfully
rotomoulded although homo and copolymers of ethylene and
homo and copolymers of propylene may in particular be
mentioned. However, the nature of the catalyst used to
make the polymer has a significant bearing on the
rotomouldability of the polymer.</p><p num="0008">In rotomoulding, polymers produced from single site
catalysts give rise to products having excellent
mechanical properties and enable rotomoulding to be
carried out over a much shorter period of time.
Polymers produced from single site catalysts tend to
have a narrow molecular weight distribution and
copolymers produced from single site catalysts tend to
have narrow comonomer distribution. These properties
gives rise to increased environmental stress cracking
resistance and improvements in other mechanical
properties. </p><p num="0009">However, the narrow distribution of comonomers as
compared to a Ziegler-Natta produced polymer, results in
a much narrower melting and crystallisation behaviour.
The sharp melting behaviour makes the polymer very
sensitive to processing temperature and, without wishing
to be limited by theory, it is believed that this causes
severe warpage in rotomoulding products. Hence, the
mechanical property benefits of using a polymer made by
single site catalysis are offset by increased warpage.</p><p num="0010">Polymers produced using Ziegler-Natta catalysts
have much broader melting/crystallisation windows than
polymers made by single site catalysis and hence tend to
produce rotomoulding products with much less warpage.
However, due to the broad comonomer distribution and
broad molecular weight distribution mechanical
properties, especially ESCR and rheology are not so
favourable.</p><p num="0011">There still remains therefore, the need to find a
polymer suitable for rotational moulding that can give
rise to products having both low warpage and excellent
rheological and mechanical properties.</p><p num="0012">It has now been surprisingly found that by forming,
e.g. blending, a particular mix of polymers, preferably
made by single site catalysis a polymer composition may
be produced which not only has excellent mechanical and
rheological properties but also does not warp after
rotomoulding since its processing window is broadened.
A blend of polymers having, depending on the monomers
involved, similar molecular weights and similar melt
flow rates but different densities, melting points or
comonomer distributions has surprisingly been found to
give rise to a composition which shows an overall narrow
molecular weight distribution and hence excellent
mechanical and rheological properties and has a
broadened processing window which eliminates warpage
normally associated with single site materials.</p><p num="0013">Hence, viewed from one aspect the invention 
provides a polymer composition suitable for rotomoulding

according to ISO 1183-1987(E). MFR is measured
according to ISO 1133-1997 (D -for PE/M for PP). The
melting point of polyethylene is measured by heating the
polymer from room temperature to 200°C at a heat rate of
10°C/min. Thee polymer is maintained at 200°C for 5 mins
and then cooled to -10°C at a cool rate of 10°C/min and
maintained at -10°C for 1 minute. The polymer is then
heated to 200°C at a heat rate of 10°C/min and the

ethylene or propylene with at least one other C<sub>2-10</sub>
α-olefin. Suitable comonomers include ethylene,
propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene etc. Clearly,
ethylene is only a suitable comonomer when the major
monomer is propylene and propylene is only a suitable
comonomer where the major monomer is ethylene.
Diolefins may also be employed as comonomers especially
those having two terminal double bonds, e.g. butadiene.
In a preferred embodiment, where component (I) or (II)
is a copolymer, it is a copolymer of ethylene with
octene, butene or hexene, especially butene or hexene.</p><p num="0024">Component (I) or (II) may also be a homopolymer of
propylene having no or only a few crystallinity
disrupting units, e.g. less than 5 units per 100
propylene linkages. By crystallinity disrupting units
it is meant a unit that disrupts the regular structure
of the polymer, i.e. an atatic unit in syndiotactic or
isotactic propylene polymers. In one embodiment, both
components (I) and (II) should be propylene homopolymers
in which component (I) is preferably a syndiotactic or
isotactic propylene component and component (II) is
preferably an amorphous propylene homopolymer. In a
less preferred embodiment component (I) may be a
polypropylene homopolymer and component (II) may be a
propylene copolymer.</p><p num="0025">In another less preferred embodiment both 
components may be ethylene homopolymers in which
component (II) comprises a high degree of short chain
branching.</p><p num="0026">In a final and most preferred embodiment, component
(I) may be an ethylene homopolymer and component (II)
may be an ethylene copolymer.</p><p num="0027">The polymer components (I) and (II) should
preferably have similar melt flow rates, i.e. the melt
flow rate of component (II) should not differ from the
melt flow rate of component (I) by greater than 40%,
e.g. 20%, preferably no more than 10%, especially no
more than 5%. The melt flow rate of the components
should be in the range 0.5 to 30, preferably 1 to 20,
more preferably 3 to 15, e.g. 4 to 10, especially 6 to
8, most especially about 6. In a highly preferred
embodiment both components (I) and (II) have a MFR of
about 6.</p><p num="0028">The melt flow rate of the entire composition should
also be in the range 0.5 to 30, preferably 1 to 20, more
preferably 2 to 15, e.g. 4 to 10, especially 6 to 8,
most especially about 6.</p><p num="0029">The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of both
components should be approximately the same, e.g. within
10%, and the MWD must be narrow, e.g. an (Mw/Mn) of less
than 4, preferably less than 3.5, especially less than
3. The MWD of the entire composition should also
preferably be less than 4, especially less than 3.5.</p><p num="0030">Whilst the Mw and Mn ranges may vary within wide
limits the Mw/Mn ratio remains low, i.e. less than 4.
In a preferred embodiment the Mw and Mn of both
components are also similar. For a polyethylene
homopolymer or copolymer suitable Mw values are in the
range 50000 to 110000, especially 65000 to 85000. For a
propylene homopolymer or copolymer suitable Mw values
are Mw of 150,000 to 300,000. The Mw of component (II)
should be within 30%, preferably 20% of the Mw of
component (I). </p><p num="0031">For compositions based on ethylene, the densities
of the two components should be different, i.e.
component (II) should have a density at least 0.010
g/cm<sup>3</sup>, especially 0.020 g/cm<sup>3</sup> different from component
(I). For ethylene homo and copolymers, preferably
component (I) should have a density in the range 0.940
to 0.970 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and component (II) should have a density
in the range of 0.880 to 0.940 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably in the
range 0.910 g/cm<sup>3</sup> to 0.930 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, said density preferably
being at least 0.010 g/cm<sup>3</sup> less than the density of
component (I).</p><p num="0032">For compositions based on ethylene, the density of
the entire composition is preferably in the range 0.925
to 0.50 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 930 to 0.940 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p num="0033">The two components must also have different
crystallinity properties, i.e. components (I) and (II)
should have different melting points. This may be
achieved by providing copolymers with differing
comonomer contents or for a composition containing only
homopolymers by providing a polymer having differing
numbers of crystallinity disrupting units (e.g. short
chain branches).</p><p num="0034">Where component (I) is an ethylene homo or
copolymer it may have a melting point of 100 to 145°C.
Where component (I) is a propylene copolymer or
propylene homopolymer it should have a melting point of
100 to 170°C.</p><p num="0035">Component (II) should have a melting point which
differs from that of component (I) by at least 5°C,
preferably at least 10°C, especially at least 20°C. In
the case of a propylene homopolymer, component (II) may
also be amorphous and may therefore have no defined
melting point.</p><p num="0036">Thus an especially preferred composition according
to the invention is a composition in which component (I)
is an ethylene homopolymer having an MFR of 6 to 8, a
molecular weight distribution of less than 3, an Mw of 
65,000 to 100,000, an Mn of 20,000 to 60,000, a density
of 0.945 to 0.970 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and a melting point of 125 to
135°C; and component (II) is an ethylene copolymer with
hexene having an MFR of 6 to 8, a molecular weight
distribution of less than 3, an Mw of 65,000 to 100,000,
an Mn of 20,000 to 60,000, a density of 0.910 to 0.940
g/cm<sup>3</sup> and a melting point of 100 to 125°C.</p><p num="0037">In order to prepare the required polymer for
rotomoulding, components (I) and (II) may be blended
using conventional blending or compounding technology.
The components (I) and (II) may be mixed in any
convenient ratio to ensure that the desired properties
are obtained. Preferably however, the ratio of
component (I) to (II) is from 95:5 to 5:95, preferably
9:1 to 1:9, especially 4:1 to 1:4, more especially 1:2
to 2:1.</p><p num="0038">Components (I) and (II) may also be used in
conjunction with other polymers in the blend such as
rotomoulding polymer grades and some Ziegler-Natta
polymers. Moreover, it is within the scope of the
invention to use a further polymer component (III) which
also has a MWD and MFR similar to components (I) and
(II) but has a still different comonomer distribution
hence producing a multimodal comonomer distribution.</p><p num="0039">The polymer composition described above gives rise
to rotomoulded articles with excellent mechanical and
rheological properties and low warpage.</p><p num="0040">The components are preferably produced using a
single site catalyst, e.g. metallocene catalyst or
potentially a dualsite catalyst. However, where
component (I) or (II) is a homopolymer Ziegler-Natta
catalysis may be employed. This is not however,
preferred. Suitable metallocene catalysts for use in the
invention may be any conventional metallocene catalyst.
As used herein, the term metallocene is used to refer to
all catalytically active metal:η-ligand complexes in
which a metal is complexed by one, two or more open 
chain or closed ring η-ligands. The use of bridged bis-η-ligand
metallocenes, single η-ligand "half
metallocenes", and bridged η-σ ligand "scorpionate"
metallocenes is particularly preferred. The metal in
such complexes is preferably a group 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A or
8A metal or a lanthanide or actinide, especially a group
4A, 5A or 6A metal, particularly Zr, Hf or Ti. The η-ligand
preferably comprises an η<sup>4</sup> or η<sup>5</sup> open chain or an
η<sup>5</sup>-cyclopentadienyl ring, optionally with a ring or chain
carbon replaced by a heteroatom (e.g. N, B, S or P),
optionally substituted by pendant or fused ring
substituents and optionally linked by bridge (e.g. a 1
to 4 atom bridge such as (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> or Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) to a
further optionally substituted homo or heterocyclic
cyclopentadienyl ring. The ring substituents may for
example be halo atoms or alkyl groups optionally with
carbons replaced by heteroatoms such as O, N and Si,
especially Si and O and optionally substituted by mono
or polycyclic groups such as phenyl or naphthyl groups.
Suitable η-ligands, include those of formula II
discussed above. Examples of such homo or heterocyclic
cyclopentadienyl ligands are well known in the art (see
e.g. EP-A-416815, WO96/04290, EP-A-485821, EP-A-485823,
US-A-5276208 and US-A-5145819).</p><p num="0041">Besides the η-ligand, the metallocene complex used
according to the invention may include other ligands;
typically these may be halide, hydride, alkyl, aryl,
alkoxy, aryloxy, amide, carbamide or other two electron
donor groups. Any hydrocarbyl ligand here will
generally contain up to 20 carbons, preferably up to 10
carbons, e.g. up to 6 carbons.</p><p num="0042">Metallocene catalysts are conventionally employed
in the presence of a cocatalyst. Suitable cocatalysts
are well known and include alkyl metal compounds, in
particular alumoxanes. Suitable alumoxanes include C<sub>1-10</sub>
alkyl alumoxanes, e.g. methyl alumoxane (MAO) and
isobutyl alumoxanes (e.g. tetra and hexaisobutyl 
alumoxane, TIBAO and HIBAO), especially MAO. Alumoxane
co-catalysts are described by Hoechst in WO-A-94/28034.
These are considered cyclic or cage like oligomers
having up to 40, preferably 3 to 20, -[Al(R")O]- repeat
units (where R" is hydrogen, C<sub>1-10</sub> alkyl, preferably
methyl, or C<sub>6-18</sub> aryl or mixtures thereof).</p><p num="0043">If desired the metallocene or metallocene/cocatalyst
mixture may be used in unsupported form or it
may be precipitated and used as such. However the
metallocene or its reaction product with the cocatalyst
is preferably introduced into the polymerization reactor
in supported form, e.g. impregnated into a porous
particulate support, as is well known in the art.</p><p num="0044">The particulate support material used is preferably
an organic or inorganic material, e.g. a polymer (such
as for example polyethylene, polypropylene, an ethylene-propylene
copolymer, another polyolefin or polystyrene
or a combination thereof). Such polymeric supports may
be formed by precipitating a polymer or by a
prepolymerization, eg of monomers used in the
polymerization for which the catalyst is intended.
However, the support is especially preferably a metal or
pseudo metal oxide such as silica, alumina or zirconia
or a mixed oxide such as silica-alumina, in particular
silica, alumina or silica-alumina.</p><p num="0045">Especially preferably the support is a porous
material so that the metallocene may be loaded into the
pores of the support, e.g. using a process analogous to
those described in WO94/14856 (Mobil), WO95/12622
(Borealis) and WO96/00243 (Exxon). The particle size is
not critical but is preferably in the range 5 to 200 µm,
more preferably 10 to 80 µm.</p><p num="0046">Before loading, the particulate support material is
preferably calcined, i.e. heat treated, preferably under
a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen. This treatment is
preferably at a temperature in excess of 100°C, more
preferably 200°C or higher, e.g. 200-800°C, particularly 
about 300°C. The calcination treatment is preferably
effected for several hours, e.g. 2 to 30 hours, more
preferably about 10 hours.</p><p num="0047">A cocatalyst, e.g. an alumoxane or an ionic
catalyst activator (such as a boron or aluminium
compound, especially a fluoroborate) may also be mixed
with or loaded onto the catalyst support material. This
may be done subsequently or more preferably
simultaneously to loading of the metallocene, for
example by including the cocatalyst in the solution of
the metallocene or, by contacting the metallocene loaded
support material with a solution of the cocatalyst or
catalyst activator, e.g. a solution in an organic
solvent. Alternatively however, any such further
material may be added to the metallocene loaded support
material in the polymerization reactor or shortly before
dosing of the catalyst material into the reactor.</p><p num="0048">In this regard, as an alternative to an alumoxane
it may be preferred to use a fluoroborate catalyst
activator, especially a B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> or more especially a
⊖B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> compound, such as C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H:B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> or
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C:B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Other borates of general formula
(cation<sup>+</sup>)<sub>a</sub> (borate<sup>-</sup>)<sub>b</sub> where a and b are positive numbers,
may also be used.</p><p num="0049">Both components (I) and (II) may be prepared
simultaneously using a dualsite catalyst, i.e. a
catalyst carrying two active metallocene sites on a
single support, one site designed to give a component
(I) and the other designed to give component (II).</p><p num="0050">The polymerisation is typically conducted in the
presence of a diluent. As a diluent, a linear, branched
or cyclic saturated hydrocarbon such as butane, propane,
pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane or
methylcyclohexane may be used.</p><p num="0051">Polymerisation to produce the polymer for use in
the invention may take place in the slurry, solution or
gas phase. Slurry phase polymerisation can be conducted 
under standard slurry conditions.</p><p num="0052">For slurry reactors, the reaction temperature will
generally be in the range 60 to 110°C (e.g. 80-110°C),
the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 5 to
80 bar (e.g. 25-65 bar), and the residence time will
generally be in the range 0.3 to 5 hours (e.g. 0.5 to 2
hours). The diluent used will generally be an aliphatic
hydrocarbon having a boiling point in the range -70 to
+100°C, especially isobutane or propane.</p><p num="0053">For solution phase reactors, the reaction
temperature used will generally be in the range 130 to
270°C, the reactor pressure will generally be in the
range 20 to 400 bar and the residence time will
generally be in the range 0.1 to 1 hour. The solvent
used will commonly be a hydrocarbon with a boiling point
in the range 80-200°C.</p><p num="0054">For gas phase reactors, the reaction temperature
used will generally be in the range 60 to 115°C (e.g. 70
to 110°C), the reactor pressure will generally be in the
range 10 to 25 bar, and the residence time will
generally be 1 to 8 hours. The gas used will commonly
be a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen together with
monomer (e.g. ethylene).</p><p num="0055">In order to ensure that copolymer particles are in
the correct size for rotational moulding the products of
any polymerisation reaction may be converted to powder
form or pelletized to a particle size of approximately
0.1 to 0.5 mm, preferably 0.3 mm using standard
technology. Hence, suitably sized pellets may be
prepared by grinding.</p><p num="0056">Alternatively micropellets may be produced using
the technique described in WO 00/35646 which is hereby
incorporated by reference. By this method a mixture of
polyolefin and optionally at least one additive is
extruded in melt form through a die and pelletised to
give particles having a particular size distribution.
The particles are then dried to very low levels of 
moisture to improve rotomouldability.</p><p num="0057">Alternatively, the polymerisation, using a dualsite
or multisite catalyst, can be set up such that the
reactor powder is suitable for use without further
manipulation. In one embodiment of the invention
rotomoulding may be carried out by combining polymer
powder with a masterbatch of UV-stabiliser-loaded
polyolefin powder in line with the teaching of
WO00/11065 which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p num="0058">The polymer powder or pellets can comprise any
standard additives e.g. one or more selected from
colouring agents, stabilisers, antioxidants, UV-absorbers,
anti-static agents, lubricants and fillers.</p><p num="0059">Rotational moulding may take place under standard
conditions. The polymer powder is placed in the mould
which is then transferred to an oven and rotated,
preferably about two axes to distribute the polymer
powder over the hot surfaces of the mould. The heating
cycle is continued until all of the powder has melted
and formed a thick, continuous layer within the mould.
The mould is then removed from the oven and cooled until
the resin has solidified. The moulded part is then
removed.</p><p num="0060">The length of time which the mould must be heated
depends on the nature of the article being moulded, the
amount of resin present and the temperature of the oven.
Typical rotomoulding temperatures are 230°C to 350°C,
more particularly 260°C to 320°C. Heating time is chosen
such that the inner air temperature in the mould is
160°C to 300°C, more preferably 170°C to 250°C. This
temperature can be measured using a Rotolog® or similar
equipment to monitor the temperature or it may be chosen
based on previous experience. Cooling may be carried
out under a stream of air, water spray or mist or simply
in ambient air at room temperature. A combination of
these methods may also be employed. Preferably cooling
is achieved using a combination of blown air followed by 
ambient air or just blown air. Cooling times are
normally of similar magnitude to heating times or
slightly longer. Slow cooling reduces the amount of
warpage present in a rotomoulded article however, it is
a purpose of the invention to provide polymer
compositions which can be cooled more rapidly without
increases in warpage compared to conventional single
site polymers. The moulded tank may be removed from its
mould at any convenient time although it is preferred if
it is removed when it has cooled to a temperature of
60°C to 100°C.</p><p num="0061">The skilled artisan is able to manipulate the
temperature, time and rotation speed/ratio within a
rotomoulding apparatus to ensure that well-formed
moulded articles are produced.</p><p num="0062">Particularly preferred rotomoulding conditions are
Rotation Speed 9/1.4 RPM; heating for 13 minutes in oven
at 270°C; fan assisted cooling for 10 minutes followed
by ambient air cooling for 6 minutes.</p><p num="0063">The polymer composition of the invention may also
have utility outside the field of rotomoulding. It is
envisaged that the composition may give benefits in
thermoforming due to the broadened processing window
which the polymers exhibit. In particular polymer
compositions of this type may be useful in the
replacement of PVC. The polymer compositions may also
be useful in film and injection moulding applications
and this forms a yet further aspect of the invention.</p><p num="0064">The invention will now be further illustrated with
reference to the following non-limiting examples and
figures. </p><heading><b>Example 1</b></heading><p num="0065">Two polymer components A and B were prepared as
