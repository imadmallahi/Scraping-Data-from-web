Apoptosis occurs in embryogenesis, metamorphosis, endocrine-dependent tissue atrophy, normal tissue turnover, and death of immune thymocytes (induced through their antigen-receptor complex or by glucocorticoids) (Itoh et al., <i>Cell</i> 66:233, 1991). During maturation of T-cells in the thymus, T-cells that recognize self-antigens are destroyed through the apoptotic process, whereas others are positively selected. The possibility that some T-cells recognizing certain self epitopes (e.g., inefficiently processed and presented antigenic determinants of a given self protein) escape this elimination process and subsequently play a role in autoimmune diseases has been suggested (Gammon et al., <i>Immunology Today</i> 12:193, 1991).</p><p num="p0002">A cell surface antigen known as Fas has been reported to mediate apoptosis and is believed to play a role in clonal deletion of self-reactive T-cells (Itoh et al., <i>Cell</i> 66:233,1991; Watanabe-Fukunage et al., <i>Nature</i> 356:314, 1992). Cross-linking a specific monoclonal antibody to Fas has been reported to induce various cell lines to undergo apoptosis (Yonehara et al., J. <i>Exp. Med.,</i> 169:1747, 1989; Trauth et al., <i>Science,</i> 245:301, 1989). However, under certain conditions, binding of a specific monoclonal antibody to Fas can have a costimulatory effect on freshly isolated T cells (Alderson et al., J. <i>Exp. Med.</i> 178:2231, 1993).</p><p num="p0003">DNAs encoding a rat Fas ligand (Suda et al., <i>Cell,</i> 75:1169, 1993) and a human Fas ligand (Takahashi et al., <i>International Immunology</i> 6:1567, 1994) have been isolated. Binding of the Fas ligand to cells expressing Fas antigen has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis (Suda et al., <i>supra</i>, and Takahashi et al., <i>supra</i>).</p><p num="p0004">Investigation into the existence and identity of other molecule(s) that play a role in apoptosis is desirable. Identifying such molecules would provide an additional means of regulating apoptosis, as well as providing further insight into the development of self-tolerance by the immune system and the etiology of autoimmune diseases.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading><b><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="p0005">The present invention provides a novel cytokine protein, as well as isolated DNA encoding the cytokine and expression vectors comprising the isolated DNA. Properties of the novel cytokine, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands, include the ability to induce apoptosis of certain types of target cells. This protein thus is designated TNF Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). Among the types of cells that are killed by contact with TRAIL are cancer cells such as leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma cells, and cells infected with a virus.</p><p num="p0006">A method for producing TRAIL polypeptides involves culturing host cells transformed with a recombinant expression vector that contains TRAIL-encoding DNA under conditions appropriate for expression of TRAIL, then recovering the expressed TRAIL polypeptide from the culture.

A method for producing recombinant TRAIL polypeptides involves cultivating host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vectors under conditions appropriate for expression of TRAIL, and recovering the expressed TRAIL.</p><p num="p0009">The present invention also provides antibodies that specifically bind TRAIL proteins. In one embodiment, the antibodies are monoclonal antibodies.</p><p num="p0010">The TRAIL protein induces apoptosis of certain types of target cells, such as transformed cells that include but are not limited to cancer cells and virally-infected cells. As demonstrated in examples 5, 8, 9, and 10 below, TRAIL induced apoptosis of human leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma cell lines. Among the uses of TRAIL is use in killing cancer cells. TRAIL finds further use in treatment of viral infections. Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) rendered human fibroblasts susceptible to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> apoptosis when contacted with TRAIL, whereas uninfected fibroblasts were not killed through contact with TRAIL (see example 11).</p><p num="p0011">Isolation of a DNA encoding human TRAIL is described in example 1 below. The nucleotide sequence of the human TRAIL DNA isolated in example 1 is presented in SEQ ID NO: 1, and the amino acid sequence encoded thereby is presented in SEQ ID NO:2. This human TRAIL protein comprises an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1-18), a transmembrane region (amino acids 19-38), and an extracellular domain (amino acids 39-281). The extracellular domain contains a receptor-binding region.</p><p num="p0012"><i>E. coli</i> strain DH10B cells transformed with a recombinant vector containing this human TRAIL DNA were deposited with the American Type Culture Collection on June 14, 1995, and assigned accession no. 69849. The deposit was made under the terms of the Budapest Treaty. The recombinant vector in the deposited strain is the expression vector pDC409 (described in example 5). The vector was digested with SalI and NotI, and human TRAIL DNA that includes the entire coding region shown in SEQ ID NO:1 was ligated into the vector.</p><p num="p0013">DNA encoding a second human TRAIL protein was isolated as described in example 2. The nucleotide sequence of this DNA is presented in SEQ ID NO:3, and the amino acid sequence encoded thereby is presented in SEQ ID NO:4. The encoded protein comprises an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1-18), a transmembrane region (amino acids 19-38), and an extracellular domain (amino acids 39-101).</p><p num="p0014">The DNA of SEQ ID NO:3 lacks a portion of the DNA of SEQ ID NO:1, and is thus designated the human TRAIL deletion variant (huTRAILdv) clone. Nucleotides 18 through 358 of SEQ ID NO: 1 are identical to nucleotides 8 through 348 of the huTRAILdv DNA of SEQ ID NO:3. Nucleotides 359 through 506 of SEQ ID NO: 1 are missing from the cloned DNA of SEQ ID NO:3. The deletion causes a shift in the reading frame, which results in an in-frame stop codon after amino acid 101 of SEQ ID NO:4. The DNA of SEQ ID NO:3 thus encodes a truncated protein. Amino acids 1 through 90 of SEQ ID NO:2 are identical to amino acids 1 through 90 of SEQ ID NO:4. However, due to the deletion, the C-terminal portion of the huTRAILdv protein (amino acids 91 through 101 of SEQ ID NO:4) differs from the residues in the corresponding positions in SEQ ID NO:2. In contrast to the full length huTRAIL protein, the truncated huTRAILdv protein does not exhibit the ability to induce apoptosis of the T cell leukemia cells of the Jurkat cell line.</p><p num="p0015">DNA encoding a mouse TRAIL protein has also been isolated, as described in example 3. The nucleotide sequence of this DNA is presented in SEQ ID NO:5 and the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> amino acid sequence encoded thereby is presented in SEQ ID NO:6. The encoded protein comprises an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1-17), a transmembrane region (amino acids 18-38), and an extracellular domain (amino acids 39-291). This mouse TRAIL is 64% identical to the human TRAIL of SEQ ID NO:2 at the amino acid level. The coding region of the mouse TRAIL nucleotide sequence is 75% identical to the coding region of the human nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p><p num="p0016">One embodiment of the present invention is directed to human TRAIL protein characterized by the N-terminal amino acid sequence MetAlaMetMetGluValGlnGly GlyProSerLeuGlyGlnThr (amino acids 1-15 of SEQ ID NOS:2 and 4). Mouse TRAIL proteins characterized by the N-terminal amino acid sequence MetProSerSerGlyAla LeuLysAspLeuSerPheSerGlnHis (amino acids 1-15 of SEQ ID NO:6) are also provided herein.</p><p num="p0017">The TRAIL of the present invention is distinct from the protein known as Fas ligand (Suda et al., <i>Cell,</i> 75:1169, 1993; Takahashi et al., <i>International Immunology</i> 6:1567, 1994). Fas ligand induces apoptosis of certain cell types, <i>via</i> the receptor known as Fas. As demonstrated in example 5, TRAIL-induced apoptosis of target cells is not mediated through Fas. The human TRAIL amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 is about 20% identical to the human Fas ligand amino acid sequence that is presented in Takahashi et al., <i>supra</i>. The extracellular domain of human TRAIL is about 28.4% identical to the extracellular domain of human Fas ligand.</p><p num="p0018">The amino acid sequences disclosed herein reveal that TRAIL is a member of the TNF family of ligands (Smith et al. <i>Cell,</i> 73:1349, 1993; Suda et al., <i>Cell,</i> 75:1169, 1993; Smith et al., <i>Cell</i>, 76:959, 1994). The percent identities between the human TRAIL extracellular domain amino acid sequence and the amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain of other proteins of this family are as follows: 28.4% with Fas ligand, 22.4% with lymphotoxin-β, 22.9% with TNF-α, 23.1% with TNF-β, 22.1 % with CD30 ligand, and 23.4% with CD40 ligand.</p><p num="p0019">TRAIL was tested for ability to bind receptors of the TNF-R family of receptors. The binding analysis was conducted using the slide autoradiography procedure of Gearing et al. <i>(EMBO J.</i> 8:3667, 1989). The analysis revealed no detectable binding of human TRAIL to human CD30, CD40, 4-1BB, OX40, TNF-R (p80 form), CD27, or LTβR (also known as TNFR-RP). The results in example 5 indicate that human TRAIL does not bind human Fas.</p><p num="p0020">The TRAIL polypeptides of the present invention include polypeptides having amino acid sequences that differ from, but are highly homologous to, those presented in SEQ ID NOS:2 and 6. Examples include, but are not limited to, homologs derived from other mammalian species, variants (both naturally occurring variants and those<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> generated by recombinant DNA technology), and TRAIL, fragments that retain a desired biological activity. Such polypeptides exhibit a biological activity of the TRAIL proteins of SEQ ID NOS:2 and 6, and preferably comprise an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical (most preferably at least 90% identical) to the amino acid sequence presented in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:6. These embodiments of the present invention are described in more detail below.</p><p num="p0021">Conserved sequences located in the C-terminal portion of proteins in the TNF family are identified in Smith et al. (<i>Cell</i>, 73:1349, 1993, see page 1353 and Figure 6); Suda et al. <i>(Cell,</i> 75:1169, 1993, see figure 7); Smith et al. <i>(Cell,</i> 76:959, 1994, see figure 3); and Goodwin et al. <i>(Eur. J. Immunol</i>., 23:2631, 1993, see figure 7 and pages 2638-39), hereby incorporated by reference. Among the amino acids in the human TRAIL protein that are conserved (in at least a majority of TNF family members) are those in positions 124-125 (AH), 136 (L), 154 (W), 169 (L), 174 (L), 180 (G), 182 (Y), 187 (Q), 190 (F), 193 (Q), and 275-276 (FG) of SEQ ID NO:2. Another structural feature of TRAIL is a spacer region between the C-terminus of the trans-membrane region and the portion of the extracellular domain that is believed to be most important for biological activity. This spacer region, located at the N-terminus of the extracellular domain, consists of amino acids 39 through 94 of SEQ ID NO:2. Analogous spacers are found in other family members, e.g., CD40 ligand. Amino acids 138 through 153 correspond to a loop between the β sheets of the folded (three dimensional) human TRAIL protein.</p><p num="p0022">Provided herein are membrane-bound TRAIL proteins (comprising a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular domain) as well as TRAIL fragments that retain a desired biological property of the full length TRAIL protein. In one embodiment, TRAIL fragments are soluble TRAIL polypeptides comprising all or part of the extracellular domain, but lacking the transmembrane region that would cause retention of the polypeptide on a cell membrane. Soluble TRAIL proteins are capable of being secreted from the cells in which they are expressed. Advantageously, a heterologous signal peptide is fused to the N-terminus such that the soluble TRAIL is secreted upon expression.</p><p num="p0023">Soluble TRAIL may be identified (and distinguished from its non-soluble membrane-bound counterparts) by separating intact cells which express the desired protein from the culture medium, e.g., by centrifugation, and assaying the medium (supernatant) for the presence of the desired protein. The presence of TRAIL in the medium indicates that the protein was secreted from the cells and thus is a soluble form of the TRAIL protein. Naturally-occurring soluble forms of TRAIL are encompassed by the present invention.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p num="p0024">The use of soluble forms of TRAIL is advantageous for certain applications. Purification of the proteins from recombinant host cells is facilitated, since the soluble proteins are secreted from the cells. Further, soluble proteins are generally more suitable for intravenous administration.</p><p num="p0025">Examples of soluble TRAIL polypeptides are those containing the entire extracellular domain (e.g., amino acids 39 to 281 of SEQ ID NO:2 or amino acids 39 to 291 of SEQ ID NO:6). Fragments of the extracellular domain that retain a desired biological activity are also provided. Such fragments advantageously include regions of TRAIL that are conserved in proteins of the TNF family of ligands, as described above.</p><p num="p0026">Additional examples of soluble TRAIL polypeptides are those lacking not only the cytoplasmic domain and transmembrane region, but also all or part of the above-described spacer region. Soluble human TRAIL polypeptides thus include, but are not limited to, polypeptides comprising amino acids x to 281, wherein x represents any of the amino acids in positions 39 through 95 of SEQ ID NO:2. In the embodiment in which residue 95 is the N-terminal amino acid, the entire spacer region has been deleted.</p><p num="p0027">TRAIL fragments, including soluble polypeptides, may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. A DNA sequence encoding a desired TRAIL fragment may be subcloned into an expression vector for production of the TRAIL fragment. The TRAIL-encoding DNA sequence advantageously is fused to a sequence encoding a suitable leader or signal peptide. The desired TRAIL-encoding DNA fragment may be chemically synthesized using known techniques. DNA fragments also may be produced by restriction endonuclease digestion of a full length cloned DNA sequence, and isolated by electrophoresis on agarose gels. If necessary, oligonucleotides that reconstruct the 5' or 3' terminus to a desired point may be ligated to a DNA fragment generated by restriction enzyme digestion. Such oligonucleotides may additionally contain a restriction endonuclease cleavage site upstream of the desired coding sequence, and position an initiation codon (ATG) at the N-terminus of the coding sequence.</p><p num="p0028">The well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure also may be employed to isolate and amplify a DNA sequence encoding a desired protein fragment. Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed as 5' and 3' primers. The oligonucleotides may additionally contain recognition sites for restriction endonucleases, to faciliate insertion of the amplified DNA fragment into an expression vector. PCR techniques are described in Saiki et al., <i>Science</i> 239:487 (1988); <i>Recombinant DNA Methodology,</i> Wu et al., eds., Academic Press, Inc., San<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Diego (1989), pp. 189-196; and <i>PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications</i>, Innis et al., eds., Academic Press, Inc. (1990).</p><p num="p0029">As will be understood by the skilled artisan, the transmembrane region of each TRAIL protein discussed above is identified in accordance with conventional criteria for identifying that type of hydrophobic domain. The exact boundaries of a transmembrane region may vary slightly (most likely by no more than five amino acids on either end) from those presented above. Computer programs useful for identifying such hydrophobic regions in proteins are available.</p><p num="p0030">The TRAIL DNA of the present invention includes cDNA, chemically synthesized DNA, DNA isolated by PCR, genomic DNA, and combinations thereof. Genomic TRAIL DNA may be isolated by hybridization to the TRAIL cDNA disclosed herein using standard techniques. RNA transcribed from the TRAIL DNA is also encompassed by the present invention.</p><p num="p0031">A search of the NCBI databank identified five expressed sequence tags (ESTs) having regions of identity with TRAIL DNA. These ESTs (NCBI accession numbers T90422, T82085, T10524, R31020, and Z36726) are all human cDNA fragments. The NCBI records do not disclose any polypeptide encoded by the ESTs, and do not indicate what the reading frame, if any, might be. However, even if the knowledge of the reading frame revealed herein by disclosure of complete TRAIL coding regions is used to express the ESTs, none of the encoded polypeptides would have the apoptosis-inducing property of the presently-claimed TRAIL polypeptides. In other words, if each of the five ESTs were inserted into expression vectors downstream from an initiator methionine codon, in the reading frame elucidated herein, none of the resulting expressed polypeptides would contain a sufficient portion of the extracellular domain of TRAIL to induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells.</p><p num="p0032">Certain embodiments of the present invention provide isolated DNA comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of nucleotides 88 to 933 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (human TRAIL coding region); nucleotides 202 to 933 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (encoding the human TRAIL extracellular domain); nucleotides 47 to 922 of SEQ ID NO:5 (mouse TRAIL coding region); and nucleotides 261 to 922 of SEQ ID NO:5 (encoding the mouse TRAIL extracellular domain). DNAs encoding biologically active fragments of the proteins of SEQ ID NOS:2 and 6 are also provided. Further embodiments include sequences comprising nucleotides 370 to 930 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and nucleotides 341 to 919 of SEQ ID NO:5, which encode the particular human and murine soluble TRAIL polypeptides, respectively, described in example 7.</p><p num="p0033">Due to degeneracy of the genetic code, two DNA sequences may differ, yet encode the same amino acid sequence. The present invention thus provides isolated<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> DNA sequences encoding biologically active TRAIL, selected from DNA comprising the coding region of a native human or murine TRAIL cDNA, or fragments thereof, and DNA which is degenerate as a result of the genetic code to the native TRAIL DNA sequence.</p><p num="p0034">Also provided herein are purified TRAIL polypeptides, both recombinant and non-recombinant. Variants and derivatives of native TRAIL proteins that retain a desired biological activity are also within the scope of the present invention. In one embodiment, the biological activity of an TRAIL variant is essentially equivalent to the biological activity of a native TRAIL protein. One desired biological activity of TRAIL is the ability to induce death of Jurkat cells. Assay procedures for detecting apoptosis of target cells are well known. DNA laddering is among the characteristics of cell death via apoptosis, and is recognized as one of the observable phenomena that distinguish apoptotic cell death from necrotic cell death. Examples of assay techniques suitable for detecting death or apoptosis of target cells include those described in examples 5 and 8 to 11. Another property of TRAIL is the ability to bind to Jurkat cells.</p><p num="p0035">TRAIL variants may be obtained by mutations of native TRAIL nucleotide sequences, for example. A TRAIL variant, as referred to herein, is a polypeptide substantially homologous to a native TRAIL, but which has an amino acid sequence different from that of native TRAIL because of one or a plurality of deletions, insertions or substitutions. TRAIL-encoding DNA sequences of the present invention encompass sequences that comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotides when compared to a native TRAIL DNA sequence, but that encode an TRAIL protein that is essentially biologically equivalent to a native TRAIL protein.</p><p num="p0036">The variant amino acid or DNA sequence preferably is at least 80% identical to a native TRAIL sequence, most preferably at least 90% identical. The degree of homology (percent identity) between a native and a mutant sequence may be determined, for example, by comparing the two sequences using computer programs commonly employed for this purpose. One suitable program is the GAP computer program, version 6.0, described by Devereux et al. (<i>Nucl. Acids Res.</i> 12:387, 1984) and available from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG). The GAP program utilizes the alignment method of Needleman and Wunsch <i>(J. Mol. Biol</i>. 48:443, 1970), as revised by Smith and Waterman <i>(Adv. Appl. Math</i> 2:482, 1981). Briefly, the GAP program defines identity as the number of aligned symbols (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids) which are identical, divided by the total number of symbols in the shorter of the two sequences. The preferred default parameters for the GAP program include: (1) a unary comparison matrix (containing a value of 1 for identities and 0 for non-identities) for nucleotides, and the weighted comparison matrix<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> of Gribskov and Burgess, <i>Nucl. Acids Res.</i> 14:6745, 1986, as described by Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds., <i>Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure</i>, National Biomedical Research Foundation, pp. 353-358, 1979; (2) a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap; and (3) no penalty for end gaps.</p><p num="p0037">Alterations of the native amino acid sequence may be accomplished by any of a number of known techniques. Mutations can be introduced at particular loci by synthesizing oligonucleotides containing a mutant sequence, flanked by restriction sites enabling ligation to fragments of the native sequence. Following ligation, the resulting reconstructed sequence encodes an analog having the desired amino acid insertion, substitution, or deletion.</p><p num="p0038">Alternatively, oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis procedures can be employed to provide an altered gene having particular codons altered according to the substitution, deletion, or insertion required. Techniques for making such alterations include those disclosed by Walder et al. <i>(Gene</i> 42:133, 1986); Bauer et al. <i>(Gene</i> 37:73, 1985); Craik <i>(BioTechniques,</i> January 1985, 12-19); Smith et al. <i>(Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods,</i> Plenum Press, 1981); and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462, which are incorporated by reference herein.</p><p num="p0039">Variants may comprise conservatively substituted sequences, meaning that one or more amino acid residues of a native TRAIL polypeptide are replaced by different residues, but that the conservatively substituted TRAIL polypeptide retains a desired biological activity that is essentially equivalent to that of a native TRAIL polypeptide. Examples of conservative substitutions include substitution of amino acids that do not alter the secondary and/or tertiary structure of TRAIL. Other examples involve substitution of amino acids outside of the receptor-binding domain, when the desired biological activity is the ability to bind to a receptor on target cells and induce apoptosis of the target cells. A given amino acid may be replaced by a residue having similar physiochemical characteristics, e.g., substituting one aliphatic residue for another (such as Ile, Val, Leu, or Ala for one another), or substitution of one polar residue for another (such as between Lys and Arg; Glu and Asp; or Gin and Asn). Other such conservative substitutions, e.g., substitutions of entire regions having similar hydrophobicity characteristics, are well known. TRAIL polypeptides comprising conservative amino acid substitutions may be tested in one of the assays described herein to confirm that a desired biological activity of a native TRAIL is retained. DNA sequences encoding TRAIL polypeptides that contain such conservative amino acid substitutions are encompassed by the present invention.</p><p num="p0040">Conserved amino acids located in the C-terminal portion of proteins in the TNF family, and believed to be important for biological activity, have been identified. These<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> conserved sequences are discussed in Smith et al. (<i>Cell</i>, 73:1349, 1993, see page 1353 and Figure 6); Suda et al. <i>(Cell,</i> 75:1169, 1993, see figure 7); Smith et al. <i>(Cell,</i> 76:959, 1994, see figure 3); and Goodwin et al. (<i>Eur. J. Immunol</i>., 23:2631, 1993, see figure 7 and pages 2638-39). Advantageously, the conserved amino acids are not altered when generating conservatively substituted sequences. If altered, amino acids found at equivalent positions in other members of the TNF family are substituted.</p><p num="p0041">TRAIL also may be modified to create TRAIL derivatives by forming covalent or aggregative conjugates with other chemical moieties, such as glycosyl groups, lipids, phosphate, acetyl groups and the like. Covalent derivatives of TRAIL may be prepared by linking the chemical moieties to functional groups on TRAIL amino acid side chains or at the N-terminus or C-terminus of a TRAIL polypeptide or the extracellular domain thereof. Other derivatives of TRAIL within the scope of this invention include covalent or aggregative conjugates of TRAIL or its fragments with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by synthesis in recombinant culture as N-terminal or C-terminal fusions. For example, the conjugate may comprise a signal or leader polypeptide sequence (e.g. the α-factor leader of <i>Saccharomyces)</i> at the N-terminus of a TRAIL polypeptide. The signal or leader peptide co-translationally or post-translationally directs transfer of the conjugate from its site of synthesis to a site inside or outside of the cell membrane or cell wall.</p><p num="p0042">TRAIL polypeptide fusions can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification and identification of TRAIL. Such peptides include, for example, poly-His or the antigenic identification peptides described in U.S. Patent No. 5,011,912 and in Hopp et al., <i>Bio</i>/<i>Technology</i> 6:1204, 1988. One such peptide is the FLAG® peptide, Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (DYKDDDDK) (SEQ ID NO:7), which is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody, thus enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. This sequence is also specifically cleaved by bovine mucosal enterokinase at the residue immediately following the Asp-Lys pairing. Fusion proteins capped with this peptide may also be resistant to intracellular degradation in E. <i>coli.</i></p><p num="p0043">A murine hybridoma designated 4E11 produces a monoclonal antibody that binds the peptide DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:7) in the presence of certain divalent metal cations (as described in U.S. Patent 5,011,912), and has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection under accession no HB 9259. Expression systems useful for producing recombinant proteins fused to the FLAG® peptide, as well as monoclonal antibodies that bind the peptide and are useful in purifying the recombinant proteins, are available from Eastman Kodak Company, Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, Connecticut.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p num="p0044">The present invention further includes TRAIL polypeptides with or without associated native-pattern glycosylation. TRAIL expressed in yeast or mammalian expression systems may be similar to or significantly different from a native TRAIL polypeptide in molecular weight and glycosylation pattern, depending upon the choice of expression system. Expression of TRAIL polypeptides in bacterial expression systems, such as E. <i>coli,</i> provides non-glycosylated molecules.</p><p num="p0045">Glycosylation sites in the TRAIL extracellular domain can be modified to preclude glycosylation while allowing expression of a homogeneous, reduced carbohydrate analog using yeast or mammalian expression systems. N-glycosylation sites in eukaryotic polypeptides are characterized by an amino acid triplet Asn-X-Y, wherein X is any amino acid except Pro and Y is Ser or Thr. Appropriate modifications to the nucleotide sequence encoding this triplet will result in substitutions, additions or deletions that prevent attachment of carbohydrate residues at the Asn side chain. Known procedures for inactivating N-glycosylation sites in proteins include those described in U.S. Patent 5,071,972 and EP 276,846. A potential N-glycosylation site is found at positions 109-111 in the human protein of SEQ ID NO:2 and at positions 52-54 in the murine protein of SEQ ID NO:6.</p><p num="p0046">In another example, sequences encoding Cys residues that are not essential for biological activity can be altered to cause the Cys residues to be deleted or replaced with other amino acids, preventing formation of incorrect intramolecular disulfide bridges upon renaturation. Other variants are prepared by modification of adjacent dibasic amino acid residues to enhance expression in yeast systems in which KEX2 protease activity is present. EP 212,914 discloses the use of site-specific mutagenesis to inactivate KEX2 protease processing sites in a protein. KEX2 protease processing sites are inactivated by deleting, adding or substituting residues to alter Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, and Lys-Arg pairs to eliminate the occurrence of these adjacent basic residues. Lys-Lys pairings are considerably less susceptible to KEX2 cleavage, and conversion of Arg-Lys or Lys-Arg to Lys-Lys represents a conservative and preferred approach to inactivating KEX2 sites. Potential KEX2 protease processing sites are found at positions 89-90 and 149-150 in the protein of SEQ ID NO:2, and at positions 85-86, 135-136, and 162-163 in the protein of SEQ ID NO:6.</p><p num="p0047">Naturally occurring TRAIL variants are also encompassed by the present invention. Examples of such variants are proteins that result from alternative mRNA splicing events (since TRAIL is encoded by a multi-exon gene) or from proteolytic cleavage of the TRAIL protein, wherein a desired biological activity is retained. Alternative splicing of mRNA may yield a truncated but biologically active TRAIL protein, such as a naturally occurring soluble form of the protein, for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> Variations attributable to proteolysis include, for example, differences in the N- or C-termini upon expression in different types of host cells, due to proteolytic removal of one or more terminal amino acids from the TRAIL protein. In addition, proteolytic cleavage may release a soluble form of TRAIL from a membrane-bound form of the protein. Allelic variants are also encompassed by the present invention.</p><heading><u style="single">Oligomers</u></heading><p num="p0048">The present invention encompasses TRAIL polypeptides in the form of oligomers, such as dimers, trimers, or higher oligomers. Oligomers may be formed by disulfide bonds between cysteine residues on different TRAIL polypeptides, or by non-covalent interactions between TRAIL polypeptide chains, for example. In other embodiments, oligomers comprise from two to four TRAIL polypeptides joined <i>via</i> covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to the TRAIL polypeptides. Such peptides may be peptide linkers (spacers), or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of TRAIL polypeptides attached thereto, as described in more detail below. The TRAIL polypeptides preferably are soluble.</p><p num="p0049">Preparation of fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al. <i>(PNAS USA</i> 88:10535, 1991); Bym et al. <i>(Nature</i> 344:667, 1990); and Hollenbaugh and Aruffo ("Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins", in <i>Current Protocols in Immunology, Supplement 4,</i> pages 10.19.1 - 10.19.11, 1992), hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment of the invention, an TRAIL dimer is created by fusing TRAIL to an Fc region polypeptide derived from an antibody. The term "Fc polypeptide" includes native and mutein forms, as well as truncated Fc polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization. The Fc polypeptide preferably is fused to a soluble TRAIL (e.g., comprising only the extracellular domain).</p><p num="p0050">A gene fusion encoding the TRAIL/Fc fusion protein is inserted into an appropriate expression vector. The TRAIL/Fc fusion proteins are allowed to assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc polypeptides, yielding divalent TRAIL. In other embodiments, TRAIL may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy or light chain. If fusion proteins are made with both heavy and light chains of an antibody, it is possible to form an TRAIL oligomer with as many as four TRAIL extracellular regions.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p num="p0051">One suitable Fc polypeptide is the native Fc region polypeptide derived from a human IgG1, which is described in PCT application WO 93/10151, hereby incorporated by reference. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Patent 5,457,035. The amino acid sequence of the mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93/10151, except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, amino acid 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. This mutein Fc exhibits reduced affinity for immunoglobulin receptors.</p><p num="p0052">Alternatively, oligomeric TRAIL may comprise two or more soluble TRAIL polypeptides joined through peptide linkers. Examples include those peptide linkers described in United States Patent 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Fusion proteins comprising multiple TRAIL polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.</p><p num="p0053">Another method for preparing oligomeric TRAIL polypeptides involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., <i>Science</i> 240:1759, 1988), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric TRAIL proteins are those described PCT application WO 94/10308, hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a soluble TRAIL polypeptide fused to a peptide that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells, and the resulting soluble oligomeric TRAIL is recovered from the culture supernatant.</p><p num="p0054">Certain members of the TNF family of proteins are believed to exist in trimeric form (Beutler and Huffel, <i>Science</i> 264:667, 1994; Banner et al., <i>Cell</i> 73:431, 1993). Thus, trimeric TRAIL may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD), as described in Hoppe et al. <i>(FEBS Letters</i> 344:191, 1994) and in U.S. Patent application serial no. 08/446,922, hereby incorporated by reference. Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric TRAIL.</p><p num="p0055">As described in example 7, a soluble Flag®-TRAIL polypeptide expressed in CV-1/EBNA cells spontaneously formed oligomers believed to be a mixture of dimers and trimers. The cytotoxic effect of this soluble Flag®-TRAIL in the assay of example 8 was enhanced by including an anti-Flag® antibody, possibly because the antibody facilitated cross-linking of TRAIL/receptor complexes. In one embodiment of the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> invention, biological activity of TRAIL is enhanced by employing TRAIL in conjunction with an antibody that is capable of cross-linking TRAIL. Cells that are to be killed may be contacted with both a soluble TRAIL polypeptide and such an antibody.</p><p num="p0056">As one example, cancer or virally infected cells are contacted with an anti-Flag® antibody and a soluble Flag®-TRAIL polypeptide. Preferably, an antibody fragment lacking the Fc region is employed. Bivalent forms of the antibody may bind the Flag® moieties of two soluble Flag®-TRAIL polypeptides that are found in separate dimers or trimers. The antibody may be mixed or incubated with a Flag®-TRAIL polypeptide prior to administration <i>in vivo.</i></p><heading><u style="single">Expression Systems</u></heading><p num="p0057">The present invention provides recombinant expression vectors for expression of TRAIL, and host cells transformed with the expression vectors. Any suitable expression system may be employed. The vectors include a DNA encoding a TRAIL polypeptide, operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory nucleotide sequences, such as those derived from a mammalian, microbial, viral, or insect gene. Examples of regulatory sequences include transcriptional promoters, operators, or enhancers, an mRNA ribosomal binding site, and appropriate sequences which control transcription and translation initiation and termination. Nucleotide sequences are operably linked when the regulatory sequence functionally relates to the TRAIL DNA sequence. Thus, a promoter nucleotide sequence is operably linked to an TRAIL DNA sequence if the promoter nucleotide sequence controls the transcription of the TRAIL DNA sequence. An origin of replication that confers the ability to replicate in the desired host cells, and a selection gene by which transformants are identified, are generally incorporated into the expression vector.</p><p num="p0058">In addition, a sequence encoding an appropriate signal peptide can be incorporated into expression vectors. A DNA sequence for a signal peptide (secretory leader) may be fused in frame to the TRAIL sequence so that the TRAIL is initially translated as a fusion protein comprising the signal peptide. A signal peptide that is functional in the intended host cells promotes extracellular secretion of the TRAIL polypeptide. The signal peptide is cleaved from the TRAIL polypeptide upon secretion of TRAIL from the cell.</p><p num="p0059">Suitable host cells for expression of TRAIL polypeptides include prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described, for example, in Pouwels et al. <i>Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual,</i> Elsevier, New York,<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> (1985). Cell-free translation systems could also be employed to produce TRAIL polypeptides using RNAs derived from DNA constructs disclosed herein.</p><p num="p0060">Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example, E. <i>coli</i> or <i>Bacilli.</i> Suitable prokaryotic host cells for transformation include, for example, <i>E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium,</i> and various other species within the genera <i>Pseudomonas, Streptomyces,</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i>. In a prokaryotic host cell, such as E. <i>coli,</i> a TRAIL polypeptide may include an N-terminal methionine residue to facilitate expression of the recombinant polypeptide in the prokaryotic host cell. The N-terminal Met may be cleaved from the expressed recombinant TRAIL polypeptide.</p><p num="p0061">Expression vectors for use in prokaryotic host cells generally comprise one or more phenotypic selectable marker genes. A phenotypic selectable marker gene is, for example, a gene encoding a protein that confers antibiotic resistance or that supplies an autotrophic requirement. Examples of useful expression vectors for prokaryotic host cells include those derived from commercially available plasmids such as the cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017). pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and thus provides simple means for identifying transformed cells. An appropriate promoter and a TRAIL DNA sequence are inserted into the pBR322 vector. Other commercially available vectors include, for example, pKK223-3 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) and pGEM1 (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI, USA).</p><p num="p0062">Promoter sequences commonly used for recombinant prokaryotic host cell expression vectors include β-lactamase (penicillinase), lactose promoter system (Chang et al., <i>Nature 275</i>:615, 1978; and Goeddel et al., <i>Nature 281</i>:544, 1979), tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel et al., <i>Nucl. Acids Res. 8</i>:4057, 1980; and EP-A-36776) and tac promoter (Maniatis, <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,</i> Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, p. 412, 1982). A particularly useful prokaryotic host cell expression system employs a phage λ P<sub>L</sub> promoter and a cI857ts thermolabile repressor sequence. Plasmid vectors available from the American Type Culture Collection which incorporate derivatives of the λ P<sub>L</sub> promoter include plasmid pHUB2 (resident in <i>E. coli</i> strain JMB9, ATCC 37092) and pPLc28 (resident in <i>E. coli</i> RR1, ATCC 53082).</p><p num="p0063">TRAIL alternatively may be expressed in yeast host cells, preferably from the <i>Saccharomyces</i> genus (e.g., <i>S. cerevisiae).</i> Other genera of yeast, such as <i>Pichia</i> or <i>Kluyveromyces,</i> may also be employed. Yeast vectors will often contain an origin of replication sequence from a 2µ yeast plasmid, an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a promoter region, sequences for polyadenylation, sequences for transcription termination, and a selectable marker gene. Suitable promoter sequences for yeast vectors include, among others, promoters for metallothionein, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 255:2073, 1980) or other glycolytic enzymes<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> (Hess et al., <i>J. Adv. Enzyme Reg.</i> 7:149, 1968; and Holland et al., <i>Biochem. 17:4900,</i> 1978), such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phospho-glucose isomerase, and glucokinase. Other suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in Hitzeman, EPA-73,657. Another alternative is the glucose-repressible ADH2 promoter described by Russell et al. <i>(J. Biol. Chem.</i> 258:2674, 1982) and Beier et al. <i>(Nature</i> 300:724, 1982). Shuttle vectors replicable in both yeast and <i>E. coli</i> may be constructed by inserting DNA sequences from pBR322 for selection and replication in E. <i>coli</i> (Amp<sup>r</sup> gene and origin of replication) into the above-described yeast vectors.</p><p num="p0064">The yeast α-factor leader sequence may be employed to direct secretion of the TRAIL polypeptide. The α-factor leader sequence is often inserted between the promoter sequence and the structural gene sequence. <i>See,</i> e.g., Kurjan et al., <i>Cell</i> 30:933, 1982 and Bitter et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA</i> 81:5330, 1984. Other leader sequences suitable for facilitating secretion of recombinant polypeptides from yeast hosts are known to those of skill in the art. A leader sequence may be modified near its 3' end to contain one or more restriction sites. This will facilitate fusion of the leader sequence to the structural gene.</p><p num="p0065">Yeast transformation protocols are known to those of skill in the art. One such protocol is described by Hinnen et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA</i> 75:1929, 1978. The Hinnen et al. protocol selects for Trp<sup>+</sup> transformants in a selective medium, wherein the selective medium consists of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% glucose, 10 µg/ml adenine and 20 µg/ml uracil.</p><p num="p0066">Yeast host cells transformed by vectors containing an ADH2 promoter sequence may be grown for inducing expression in a "rich" medium. An example of a rich medium is one consisting of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 1% glucose supplemented with 80 µg/ml adenine and 80 µg/ml uracil. Derepression of the ADH2 promoter occurs when glucose is exhausted from the medium.</p><p num="p0067">Mammalian or insect host cell culture systems could also be employed to express recombinant TRAIL polypeptides. Bacculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are reviewed by Luckow and Summers, <i>Bio</i>/<i>Technology</i> 6:47 (1988). Established cell lines of mammalian origin also may be employed. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (Gluzman et al., <i>Cell</i> 23:175, 1981), L cells, C 127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, and BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, and the CVI/EBNA cell line derived from<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> the African green monkey kidney cell line CVI (ATCC CCL 70) as described by McMahan et al. <i>(EMBO J.</i> 10: 2821, 1991).</p><p num="p0068">Transcriptional and translational control sequences for mammalian host cell expression vectors may be excised from viral genomes. Commonly used promoter sequences and enhancer sequences are derived from Polyoma virus, Adenovirus 2, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and human cytomegalovirus. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome, for example, SV40 origin, early and late promoter, enhancer, splice, and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide other genetic elements for expression of a structural gene sequence in a mammalian host cell. Viral early and late promoters are particularly useful because both are easily obtained from a viral genome as a fragment which may also contain a viral origin of replication (Fiers et al., <i>Nature</i> 273:113, 1978). Smaller or larger SV40 fragments may also be used, provided the approximately 250 bp sequence extending from the <i>Hind</i> III site toward the <i>Bgl</i> I site located in the SV40 viral origin of replication site is included.</p><p num="p0069">Expression vectors for use in mammalian host cells can be constructed as disclosed by Okayama and Berg (<i>Mol.

PG5.7 components include a fragment of CHO cell genomic DNA, followed by a CMV-derived promoter, which is followed by a sequence encoding an adenovirus tripartite leader, which in turn is followed by a sequence encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). These components were inserted into the plasmid vector pGEM1 (Promega, Madison, WI).

Example 7 illustrates the use of one such leader. In example 7, mammalian host cells were transformed with an expression vector encoding the peptide Met Ala Arg Arg Leu Trp Ile Leu Ser Leu Leu Ala Val Thr Leu Thr Val Ala Leu Ala Ala Pro Ser Gln Lys Ser Lys Arg Arg Thr Ser Ser (SEQ ID NO:9) fused to the N-terminus of an octapeptide designated FLAG® (SEQ ID NO:7, described above), which in turn is fused to the N-terminus of a soluble TRAIL polypeptide. Residues 1 through 29 of SEQ ID NO:9 constitute a CMV-derived leader sequence, whereas residues 30 through 32 are encoded by oligonucleotides employed in constructing the expression vector described in example 7. In one embodiment, DNA encoding a poly-His peptide (e.g., a peptide containing six histidine residues) is positioned between the sequences encoding the CMV leader and the FLAG® peptide.</p><p num="p0074">Expression systems that employ such CMV-derived leader peptides are useful for expressing proteins other than TRAIL. Expression vectors comprising a DNA sequence that encodes amino acids 1 through 29 of SEQ ID NO:9 are provided herein. In another embodiment, the vector comprises a sequence that encodes amino acids 1 through 28 of SEQ ID NO:9. DNA encoding a desired heterologous protein is positioned downstream of, and in the same reading frame as, DNA encoding the leader. Additional residues (e.g., those encoded by linkers or primers) may be encoded by DNA positioned between the sequences encoding the leader and the desired heterologous protein, as illustrated by the vector described in example 7. As is understood in the pertinent field, the expression vectors comprise promoters and any other desired regulatory sequences, operably linked to the sequences encoding the leader and heterologous protein.</p><p num="p0075">The leader peptide presented in SEQ ID NO:9 may be cleaved after the arginine residue at position 29 to yield the mature secreted form of a protein fused thereto.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> Alternatively or additionally, cleavage may occur between amino acids 20 and 21, or between amino acids 28 and 29, of SEQ ID NO:9.</p><p num="p0076">The skilled artisan will recognize that the position(s) at which the signal peptide is cleaved may vary according to such factors as the type of host cells employed, whether murine or human TRAIL is expressed by the vector, and the like. Analysis by computer program reveals that the primary cleavage site may be between residues 20 and 21 of SEQ ID NO:9. Cleavage between residues 22 and 23, and between residues 27 and 28, is predicted to be possible, as well. To illustrate, expression and secretion of a soluble murine TRAIL polypeptide resulted in cleavage of a CMV-derived signal peptide at multiple positions. The three most prominent species of secreted protein (in descending order) resulted from cleavage between amino acids 20 and 21 of SEQ ID NO:9, cleavage between amino acids 22 and 23, and cleavage between amino acids 27 and 28.</p><p num="p0077">A method for producing a heterologous recombinant protein involves culturing mammalian host cells transformed with such an expression vector under conditions that promote expression and secretion of the heterologous protein, and recovering the protein from the culture medium. Expression systems employing CMV leaders may be used to produce any desired protein, examples of which include, but are not limited to, colony stimulating factors, interferons, interleukins, other cytokines, and cytokine receptors.</p><heading><u style="single">Purified TRAIL Protein</u></heading><p num="p0078">The present invention provides purified TRAIL proteins, which may be produced by recombinant expression systems as described above or purified from naturally occurring cells. The desired degree of purity may depend on the intended use of the protein. A relatively high degree of purity is desired when the protein is to be administered <i>in vivo,</i> for example. Advantageously, TRAIL polypeptides are purified such that no protein bands corresponding to other proteins are detectable by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It will be recognized by one skilled in the pertinent field that multiple bands corresponding to TRAIL protein may be detected by SDS-PAGE, due to differential glycosylation, variations in post-translational processing, and the like, as discussed above. A preparation of TRAIL protein is considered to be purified as long as no bands corresponding to different (non-TRAIL) proteins are visualized. TRAIL most preferably is purified to substantial homogeneity, as indicated by a single protein band upon analysis by SDS-PAGE. The protein band may be visualized by silver staining, Coomassie blue staining, or (if the protein is radiolabeled) by autoradiography.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p num="p0079">One process for producing the TRAIL protein comprises culturing a host cell transformed with an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence that encodes TRAIL under conditions such that TRAIL is expressed. The TRAIL protein is then recovered from the culture (from the culture medium or cell extracts). As the skilled artisan will recognize, procedures for purifying the recombinant TRAIL will vary according to such factors as the type of host cells employed and whether or not the TRAIL is secreted into the culture medium.</p><p num="p0080">For example, when expression systems that secrete the recombinant protein are employed, the culture medium first may be concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. Following the concentration step, the concentrate can be applied to a purification matrix such as a gel filtration medium. Alternatively, an anion exchange resin can be employed, for example, a matrix or substrate having pendant diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) groups. The matrices can be acrylamide, agarose, dextran, cellulose or other types commonly employed in protein purification. Alternatively, a cation exchange step can be employed. Suitable cation exchangers include various insoluble matrices comprising sulfopropyl or carboxymethyl groups. Sulfopropyl groups are preferred. Finally, one or more reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) steps employing hydrophobic RP-HPLC media, (e.g., silica gel having pendant methyl or other aliphatic groups) can be employed to further purify TRAIL. Some or all of the foregoing purification steps, in various combinations, can be employed to provide a purified TRAIL protein.</p><p num="p0081">Recombinant protein produced in bacterial culture may be isolated by initial disruption of the host cells, centrifugation, extraction from cell pellets if an insoluble polypeptide, or from the supernatant fluid if a soluble polypeptide, followed by one or more concentration, salting-out, ion exchange, affinity purification or size exclusion chromatography steps. Finally, RP-HPLC can be employed for final purification steps. Microbial cells can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents.</p><p num="p0082">Transformed yeast host cells are preferably employed to express TRAIL as a secreted polypeptide. This simplifies purification. Secreted recombinant polypeptide from a yeast host cell fermentation can be purified by methods analogous to those disclosed by Urdal et al. <i>(J. Chromatog.</i> 296:171, 1984). Urdal et al. describe two sequential, reversed-phase HPLC steps for purification of recombinant human IL-2 on a preparative HPLC column.</p><p num="p0083">Alternatively, TRAIL polypeptides can be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. An affinity column containing an antibody that binds TRAIL may be<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> prepared by conventional procedures and employed in purifying TRAIL. Example 4 describes a procedure for generating monoclonal antibodies directed against TRAIL.</p><heading><u style="single">Properties and Uses of TRAIL</u></heading><p num="p0084">Programmed cell death (apoptosis) occurs during embryogenesis, metamorphosis, endocrine-dependent tissue atrophy, normal tissue turnover, and death of immune thymocytes. Regulation of programmed cell death is vital for normal functioning of the immune system. To illustrate, T cells that recognize self-antigens are destroyed through the apoptotic process during maturation of T-cells in the thymus, whereas other T cells are positively selected. The possibility that some T-cells recognizing certain self epitopes (e.g., inefficiently processed and presented antigenic determinants of a given self protein) escape this elimination process and subsequently play a role in autoimmune diseases has been proposed (Gammon et al., <i>Immunology Today</i> 12:193, 1991).</p><p num="p0085">Insufficient apoptosis has been implicated in certain conditions, while elevated levels of apoptotic cell death have been associated with other diseases. The desirability of identifying and using agents that regulate apoptosis in treating such disorders is recognized (Kromer, <i>Advances in Immunology,</i> 58:211, 1995; Groux et al., <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. 175:331, 1992; Sachs and Lotem, <i>Blood</i> 82:15, 1993).</p><p num="p0086">Abnormal resistance of T cells toward undergoing apoptosis has been linked to lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, accumulation of self-reactive T cells, autoimmune disease, development of leukemia, and development of lymphoma (Kromer, <i>supra</i>; see especially pages 214-215). Conversely, excessive apoptosis of T cells has been suggested to play a role in lymphopenia, systemic immunodeficiency, and specific immunodeficiency, with specific examples being virus-induced immunodeficient states associated with infectious mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infection, and tumor-mediated immunosuppression (Kromer, <i>supra</i>; see especially page 214). Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in HIV-infected individuals may be attributable to inappropriate activation-induced cell death (AICD) by apoptosis (Groux et al., <i>J. Exp. Med.</i> 175:331, 1992).</p><p num="p0087">As demonstrated in examples 5 and 8, TRAIL induces apoptosis of the acute T cell leukemia cell line designated Jurkat clone E6-1. TRAIL thus is a research reagent useful in studies of apoptosis, including the regulation of programmed cell death. Since Jurkat cells are a leukemia cell line arising from T cells, the TRAIL of the present invention finds use in studies of the role TRAIL may play in apoptosis of other transformed T cells, such as other malignant cell types arising from T cells.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --></p><p num="p0088">TRAIL binds Jurkat cells, as well as inducing apoptosis thereof. TRAIL did not cause death of freshly isolated murine thymocytes, or peripheral blood T cells (PBTs) freshly extracted from a healthy human donor. A number of uses flow from these properties of TRAIL.</p><p num="p0089">TRAIL polypeptides may be used to purify leukemia cells, or any other cell type to which TRAIL binds. Leukemia cells may be isolated from a patient's blood, for example. In one embodiment, the cells are purified by affinity chromatography, using a chromatography matrix having TRAIL bound thereto. The TRAIL attached to the chromatography matrix may be a full length protein, an TRAIL fragment comprising the extracellular domain, an TRAIL-containing fusion protein, or other suitable TRAIL polypeptide described herein. In one embodiment, a soluble TRAIL/Fc fusion protein is bound to a Protein A or Protein G column through interaction of the Fc moiety with the Protein A or Protein G. Alternatively, TRAIL may be used in isolating leukemia cells by flow cytometry.</p><p num="p0090">The thus-purified leukemia cells are expected to die following binding of TRAIL, but the dead cells will still bear cell surface antigens, and may be employed as immunogens in deriving anti-leukemia antibodies. The leukemia cells, or a desired cell surface antigen isolated therefrom, find further use in vaccine development.</p><p num="p0091">Since TRAIL binds and kills leukemia cells (the Jurkat cell line), TRAIL also may be useful in treating leukemia. A therapeutic method involves contacting leukemia cells with an effective amount of TRAIL. In one embodiment, a leukemia patient's blood is contacted <i>ex vivo</i> with an TRAIL polypeptide. The TRAIL may be immobilized on a suitable matrix. TRAIL binds the leukemia cells, thus removing them from the patient's blood before the blood is returned into the patient.</p><p num="p0092">Alternatively or additionally, bone marrow extracted from a leukemia patient may be contacted with an amount of TRAIL effective in inducing death of leukemia cells in the bone marrow. Bone marrow may be aspirated from the sternum or iliac crests, for example, and contacted with TRAIL to purge leukemia cells. The thus-treated marrow is returned to the patient.</p><p num="p0093">TRAIL also binds to, and induces apoptosis of, lymphoma and melanoma cells (see examples 5, 9, and 10). Thus, uses of TRAIL that are analogous to those described above for leukemia cells are applicable to lymphoma and melanoma cells. TRAIL polypeptides may be employed in treating cancer, including, but not limited to, leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma. In one embodiment, the lymphoma is Burkitt's lymphoma. Table I in example 9 shows that TRAIL had a cytotoxic effect on several Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Epstein-Barr virus is an etiologic agent of Burkitt's lymphoma.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p num="p0094">TRAIL polypeptides also find use in treating viral infections. Contact with TRAIL caused death of cells infected with cytomegalovirus, but not of the same cell type when uninfected, as described in example 11. The ability of TRAIL to kill cells infected with other viruses can be confirmed using the assay described in example 11. Such viruses include, but are not limited to, encephalomyocarditis virus, Newcastle disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus-2, bovine viral diarrhea virus, HIV, and Epstein-Barr virus.</p><p num="p0095">An effective amount of TRAIL is administered to a mammal, including a human, afflicted with a viral infection. In one embodiment, TRAIL is employed in conjunction with interferon to treat a viral infection. In the experiment described in example 11, pretreatment of CMV-infected cells with γ-interferon enhanced the level of killing of the infected cells that was mediated by TRAIL. TRAIL may be administered in conjunction with other agents that exert a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells or virus-infected cells.</p><p num="p0096">In another embodiment, TRAIL is used to kill virally infected cells in cell preparations, tissues, or organs that are to be transplanted. To illustrate, bone marrow may be contacted with TRAIL to kill virus infected cells that may be present therein, before the bone marrow is transplanted into the recipient.</p><p num="p0097">The TRAIL of the present invention may be used in developing treatments for any disorder mediated (directly or indirectly) by defective or insufficient amounts of TRAIL. A therapeutically effective amount of purified TRAIL protein is administered to a patient afflicted with such a disorder. Alternatively, TRAIL DNA sequences may be employed in developing a gene therapy approach to treating such disorders. Disclosure herein of native TRAIL nucleotide sequences permits the detection of defective TRAIL genes, and the replacement thereof with normal TRAIL-encoding genes. Defective genes may be detected in in vitro diagnostic assays, and by comparision of the native TRAIL nucleotide sequence disclosed herein with that of a TRAIL gene derived from a person suspected of harboring a defect in this gene.</p><p num="p0098">The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising purified TRAIL and a physiologically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents, and excipients are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. Such compositions may comprise buffers, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates including glucose, sucrose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and other stabilizers and excipients commonly employed in pharmaceutical compositions. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with conspecific serum albumin are among the appropriate diluents.

Thus, for example, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered locally, by intravenous injection, continuous infusion, sustained release from implants, or other suitable technique. Appropriate dosages and the frequency of administration will depend, of course, on such factors as the nature and severity of the indication being treated, the desired response, the condition of the patient and so forth.</p><p num="p0100">The TRAIL protein employed in the pharmaceutical compositions preferably is purified such that the TRAIL protein is substantially free of other proteins of natural or endogenous origin, desirably containing less than about 1% by mass of protein contaminants residual of production processes. Such compositions, however, can contain other proteins added as stabilizers, carriers, excipients or co-therapeutics.</p><p num="p0101">The TRAIL-encoding DNAs disclosed herein find use in the production of TRAIL polypeptides, as discussed above. Fragments of the TRAIL nucleotide sequences are also useful. In one embodiment, such fragments comprise at least about 17 consecutive nucleotides, more preferably at least 30 consecutive nucleotides, of the human or murine TRAIL DNA disclosed herein. DNA and RNA complements of said fragments are provided herein, along with both single-stranded and double-stranded forms of the TRAIL DNA of SEQ ID NOS:1, 3 and 5.</p><p num="p0102">Among the uses of such TRAIL nucleic acid fragments are use as a probe or as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As one example, a probe corresponding to the extracellular domain of TRAIL may be employed. The probes find use in detecting the presence of TRAIL nucleic acids in <i>in vitro</i> assays and in such procedures as Northern and Southern blots. Cell types expressing TRAIL can be identified as well. Such procedures are well known, and the skilled artisan can choose a probe of suitable length, depending on the particular intended application. For PCR, 5' and 3' primers corresponding to the termini of a desired TRAIL DNA sequence are employed to isolate and amplify that sequence, using conventional techniques.</p><p num="p0103">Other useful fragments of the TRAIL nucleic acids are antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprising a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence (either RNA or DNA) capable of binding to target TRAIL mRNA (sense) or TRAIL DNA (antisense) sequences. Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides, preferably from about 14 to about 30 nucleotides. The ability to create an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a cDNA sequence for a given protein is described in,<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> for example, Stein and Cohen, <i>Cancer Res.</i> 48:2659, 1988 and van der Krol et al., <i>BioTechniques</i> 6:958, 1988.</p><p num="p0104">Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block translation (RNA) or transcription (DNA) by one of several means, including enhanced degradation of the duplexes, premature termination of transcription or translation, or by other means.

Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable <i>in vivo</i> (i.e., capable of resisting enzymatic degradation) but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences. Other examples of sense or antisense oligonucleotides include those oligonucleotides which are covalently linked to organic moieties, such as those described in WO 90/10448, and other moieties that increases affinity of the oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid sequence, such as poly-(L-lysine). Further still, intercalating agents, such as ellipticine, and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oliginucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence.</p><p num="p0106">Antisense or sense oligonucleotides may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by any gene transfer method, including, for example, CaPO<sub>4</sub>-mediated DNA transfection, electroporation, or other gene transfer vectors such as Epstein-Barr virus. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides are preferably introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by insertion of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide into a suitable retroviral vector, then contacting the cell with the retrovirus vector containing the inserted sequence, either <i>in vivo</i> or <i>ex vivo.</i> Suitable retroviral vectors include, but are not limited to, the murine retrovirus M-MuLV, N2 (a retrovirus derived from M-MuLV), or or the double copy vectors designated DCT5A, DCT5B and DCT5C (see PCT Application WO 90/13641).

Incubation of L929 cells with either human or murine TRAIL resulted in a decrease in crystal violet staining, thus demonstrating that human and murine TRAIL are active on (induced apoptosis of) murine cells. In addition to crystal violet, cell death was confirmed by trypan-blue staining.</p><heading><b><u style="single">EXAMPLE 11: Lysis of CMV-Infected Cells</u></b></heading><p num="p0183">The following experiment demonstrates that the soluble Flag®-human TRAIL protein prepared in example 7 has a cytotoxic effect on virally infected cells.</p><p num="p0184">Normal human gingival fibroblasts were grown to confluency on 24 well plates in 10% CO<sub>2</sub> and DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 µg/ml penicillin. Samples of the fibroblasts were treated as indicated in Figure 2. Concentrations of cytokines were 10 ng/ml for γ-interferon and 30 ng/ml of soluble Flag®-human TRAIL. All samples receiving TRAIL also received a two-fold excess by weight of anti-Flag® antibody M2 (described above), which enhances TRAIL activity (presumably by crosslinking).</p><p num="p0185">Pretreatment of cells with the indicated cytokines was for 20 hours. To infect cells with cytomegalovirus (CMV), culture media were aspirated and the cells were infected with CMV in DMEM with an approximate MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 5. After two hours the virus containing media was replaced with DMEM and cytokines added as indicated. After 24 hours the cells were stained with crystal violet dye as described (Flick and Gifford, 1984, <i>supra</i>). Stained cells were washed twice with water, disrupted in 200 µl of 2% sodium deoxycholate, diluted 5 fold in water, and the OD taken at 570 nm. Percent maximal staining was calculated by normalizing ODs to the sample that showed the greatest staining. Similar results were obtained from several independent experiments.</p><p num="p0186">The results presented in Figure 2 demonstrate that TRAIL specifically killed CMV infected fibroblasts. This cell death was enhanced by pretreatment of the cells with γ-interferon. No significant death of non-virally infected fibroblasts resulted from contact with TRAIL.</p><heading><b><u style="single">EXAMPLE 12: Assay to Identify Blocking Antibodies</u></b></heading><p num="p0187">Blocking antibodies directed against TRAIL may be identified by testing antibodies for the ability to inhibit a particular biological activity of TRAIL.
