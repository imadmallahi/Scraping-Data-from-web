Nos. 5,334,646, 5,508,334, 5,262,468, 5,153,254, 4,618,213; and 4,369,284. These gels can be use for flossing because of their extreme softness and strength. The SEBS and SEPS triblock copolymer oil gels, however, do not have sufficient resistance to tearing when the gel is repeatedly notched or nicked by inserting and re-inserting between the teeth gaps while at the same time applying constant tension to the floss. This failure makes triblock copolymer gels much less desirable and commercially useless and unacceptable to the flossing consumer.</p><heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><p>1. Statement Of The Invention</p><p>I have discovered an improved dental floss and gum massager made from novel compositions comprising gels with improved high tear strength, improved high tensile strength, and improved resistance to high stress rupture. The improved gels can be formed into gel strands, gel tapes, and gel sheets for massaging the gum and flossing the teeth. The gel floss can be in the form of strands and tapes when rapped around the fingers for holding, extending, and flossing are advantageously more comfortable and less restricting to blood circulation in the fingers than conventional dental floss. When the gel floss is in the form of a sheet, it is additionally advantages for the sheet to have at least two separate selective sized holes at a selective distance apart for holding said sheet by one or more fingers of one or both hands, said sheet having a selected shaped peripheral sheet edge of a selective thickness, said holes being a selective distance from said edge and sized for insertion through by at least one said finger of each hand for holding said sheet and gripping, pulling, pushing, deforming, working, deforming, manipulating, folding and guilding said sheet edge for massaging the gum and flossing the teeth without substantial constriction of blood flow of said fingers by said sheet.</p><p>I have now discovered gels with improved damage tolerance, crack propagation resistance and tear resistance which are advantageously suitable for use as dental floss that are from about twice to about ten times or better in lowering the gap insertion breaking frequency than same rigidity gels made from triblock copolymer oil gels alone.</p><p>The invention comprises gels and articles useful as floss made from mixtures of triblock copolymers having at least one different midblock or multiblock copolymers having one, two or more different midblocks which gels exhibit advantages of improved tensile strength, improved tear strength (propagation resistance under tension and continuous notching and nicking) and additionally improved resistance to high stress rupture. Such combination of properties are not found in gels of substantially the same rigidity made from SEBS or SEPS triblock copolymers alone. The gels of the present invention exhibit low set, high dimensional stability, crack, tear, craze, and creep resistance under tension, excellent tensile strength and high elongation, long service life under shear, stress and strain and capable of withstanding repeated dynamic shear, tear and stress forces, excellent processing ability for cast molding, extruding, fiber forming film forming and spinning, non-toxic, nearly tasteless and odorless, soft and strong, optically clear, highly flexible, possessing elastic memory, substantially with little or no plasticizer bleedout. The gels are especially advantageously suitable where resistance to crazing, cracking, fracturing, and catastrophic failure while under dynamic stretch tension loads in an environment where continuous or repeated shearing, cutting, nicking, notching, lacerating, mutilating, and tearing of the gel in contact with or between other bodies (i.e., abraded by repeated contact with another body or bodies) are encountered, such as those forces acting during dental flossing. The resistance to tear propagation or ability to stop direct crack propagation under dynamic tension loads is a critical factor and an advantage of the present gels over triblock copolymer gels alone.</p><p>Still further, the tear resistance of gels floss based on typical SEBS or SEPS triblock copolymers can be improved with the addition of the multiblock copolymers or selected crystalline block copolymers forming the gels of the invention.</p><p>Generally, the instant improved gels comprises: (I) 100 parts by weight of one or more high viscosity or selected low viscosity linear, branched, radial, star-shaped, multi-arm or branched block copolymers or mixtures of two or more such block copolymers, said block copolymers having one or more midblocks, said midblocks comprising one or more substantially amorphous midblocks or one or more substantially crystalline polyethylene midblocks and with nil, one or more amorphous midblocks with the proviso that when said gel comprises a mixture of one or more of a substantially amorphous midblock block copolymers, at least one selected substantially crystalline polyethylene midblock block copolymer is present in combination in said admixture; optionally in combination with a selected amount of one or more of a (II) polymer or copolymer, and selected amounts of a plasticizing oil (III) sufficient to achieve gel rigidities of from less than about 2 gram Bloom to about 1,800 gram Bloom with the proviso that said block copolymers having nil amorphous midblocks are combined with at least one block copolymer having at least one amorphous midblock.</p><p>As used herein, the term "gel rigidity" in gram Bloom is determined by the gram weight required to depress a gel a distance of 4 mm with a piston having a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimeter at 23</p><p>The gels comprising thermoplastic elastomer block copolymers having one or more advantageously sufficient amount of crystalline polyethylene midblocks of the invention are hereafter referred to as "elastic-crystalline gels" or simpler "crystal gels". The block midblocks of copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention are characterized by sufficient crystallinity as to exhibit a melting endotherm of at least about 40</p><p>The various types of high viscosity or low viscosity linear, branched, radial, star-shaped or multiarm block copolymers or mixtures of two or more such block copolymers employed in forming the crystal gels of the invention are of the general configurations A-Z-A and (A-Z).sub.n, wherein the subscript n is two or more. In the case of multiarm block copolymers where n is 2, the block copolymer denoted by (A-Z).sub.n is A-Z-A. It is understood that the coupling agent is ignored for sake of simplicity in the description of the (A-Z).sub.n block copolymers.</p><p>The end block segment (A) comprises a glassy amorphous polymer end block segment, preferably, polystyrene. The midblocks (Z) comprises one or more midblocks of substantially poly(butylene) or -B- as further denoted below and substantially crystalline poly(ethylene) (simply denoted by "-E- or (E)") with or without one or more amorphous midblocks of poly(butylene), poly(ethylene-butylene), poly(ethylene-propylene) or combination thereof (the amorphous midblocks are denoted by "-B- or (B)", "-EB- or (EB)", and "-EP- or (EP)" respectively or simply denoted by "-W- or (W)" when referring to one or more of the amorphous midblocks as a group) The A and Z portions are incompatible and form a two or more-phase system consisting of sub-micron amorphous glassy domains (A) interconnected by (Z) chains. The glassy domains serve to crosslink and reinforce the structure. This physical elastomeric network structure is reversible, and heating the polymer above the softening point of the glassy domains temporarily disrupt the structure, which can be restored by lowering the temperature.</p><p>The (I) linear, branched, radial, star-shaped, multi-arm or branched block copolymers block copolymers are characterized as having a Brookfield Viscosity value at 5 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 30 advantageously from about 40 cps to about 160 cps and higher, more advantageously from about 50 cps to about 180 cps and higher, still more advantageously from about 70 cps to about 210 cps and higher, and even more advantageously from about 90 cps to about 380 cps and higher.</p><p>The (I) linear, branched, radial, star-shaped, multi-arm or branched block copolymers are characterized as having a Brookfield Viscosity value at 5 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 30 80 cps to about 380 cps and higher, advantageously from about 150 cps to about 260 cps and higher, more advantageously from about 200 cps to about 580 cps and higher, and still more advantageously from about 100 cps to about 800 cps and higher.</p><p>The substantially amorphous block copolymers (SEBS or (SEB).sub.n with high butylene content and SEPS or (SEP).sub.n with high isopropylethyene content) forming components of mixtures of the gels of the present invention are of high molecular weights, but by their nature exhibit lower viscosity which advantageously range from less than about 1,000 cp to about 100 cp toluene viscosity at 10% solids at 25 advantageously less than about 500 cp to about 100 cp, still more advantageously less than about 200 cp to about 90 cp or less.</p><p>The crystal gels can be made in combination with a selected amount of one or more selected polymers and copolymers (II) including thermoplastic crystalline polyurethane elastomers with hydrocarbon midblocks, homopolymers, copolymers, block copolymers, polyethylene copolymers, polypropylene copolymers, and the like described below.</p><p>The crystal gels forming the floss of the invention are also suitable in physically interlocking or forming with other selected materials to form gel composites combinations. The materials are selected from the group consisting of foam, plastic, fabric, various natural and synthetic resins particles, fibers and films.</p><p>Commercial resins which can aid in adhesion to materials (plastics, glass, and metals) may be added in minor amounts to the gelatinous elastomer composition, these resins include: polymerized mixed olefins (Super Sta-tac, Betaprene Nevtac, Escorez, Hercotac, Wingtack, Piccotac), polyterpene (Zonarez, Nirez, Piccolyte, Sylvatac), glycerol ester of rosin (Foral), pentaerythritol ester of rosin (Pentalyn), saturated alicyclic hydrocarbon (Arkon P), coumarone indene (Cumar LX), hydrocarbon (Picco 6000, Regalrez), mixed olefin (Wingtack), alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon (Nevchem), Polyalphamethylstyrene/vinyl toluene copolymer (Piccotex), polystyrene (Kristalex, Piccolastic), special resin (LX-1035), and the like.</p><p>Furthermore, the interlocking materials with the gel of the invention may be made from flexible materials, such as fibers and fabrics of cotton, flax, and silk. Other flexible materials include: elastomers, fiber-reinforced composites, mohair, and wool. Useful synthetic fibers include: acetate, acrylic, aremid, glass, modacrylic polyethylene, nylon, olefin, polyester, rayon, spandex, carbon, sufar, polybenzimidazole, and combinations of the above. Useful open-cell plastics include: polyamides, polyimides, polyesters, polyisocyanurates, polyisocyanates, polyurethanes, poly(vinyl alcohol), etc. Open-celled Plastic (foams) suitable for use with the compositions of the invention are described in "Expanded Plastics and Related Products", Chemical Technology Review No. 221, Noyes Data Corp., 1983, and "Applied Polymer Science", Organic Coatings and Plastic Chemistry, 1975.

The main problem with conventional dental floss, such as waxed, unwaxed nylon, spongy nylon, and teflon is that when tension is applied while inserting it between the teeth, the floss can forcefully strike the gum or gum line as it is inserted through a tight teeth gap suddenly releasing with a snap, impacting the gum, producing pain, at times causing lacerations or bleeding of the gums. Another serious problem using conventional floss is that the tension applied in flossing is transferred to the floss windings around the fingers as the floss is pulled tightly in tension for insertion through the gap and in tension for up-and-down flossing. With the flossing of each teeth, the cumulative tensions cause the windings to become ever tighter. As with teflon floss, more windings are needed to maintain tension because of natural slippage. Without loosening of the windings, eventually, the fingers can become extremely uncomfortable turning blue from lack of circulation. With the use of conventional floss and teflon less so, shredding of the floss caused by tight teeth gaps is another problem. Up to now, the process of flossing can be an uncomfortable experience. People knowing they should floss do not or do not do so as often because of the pain and discomfort involved. Most dentist would not recommend young children to floss their own teeth because serious gum damage may result due to improper flossing.</p><p>Tearing of the SEES gels has been of major concern. In general, amorphous gels such as those made form SEES and SEPS can fail catastrophically when subjected repeatedly to applied forces of high dynamic and static deformations, such as extreme compression, torsion, high tension, high elongation involving tearing and high stress rupture conditions encountered during flossing. Additionally, the development of cracks or crazes resulting from a large number of deformation cycles can induce catastrophic fatigue failure of amorphous gel composites, such as tears and rips between the surfaces of the amorphous gel and substrates or at the interfaces of interlocking material(s) and gel. Consequently, such amorphous gels are inadequate for the most demanding applications involving endurance at high stress and strain levels over an extended period of time. Consequently, when the gel is used as floss which when cut or notched during use, the resulting catastrophic failure renders the gel floss useless. Therefore, the World needs a softer, gentler, more gum friendly non-lacerating dental floss.</p><p>Normally, for triblock copolymer gel floss, tensile stress, bending, or twisting are not the cause of failure; it is the crack openings, v-notches or nicks formed on opposite sides of the gel floss as it is inserted and re-inserted into the teeth gap under continuous tension that develops and fails catastrophically. It is observed that triblock copolymer gel floss break apart suddenly under tension during the first insertion, often times it can catastrophically break apart during the second or third insertion, and more often times it can catastrophically snap apart during the third or fourth insertions. In most instances, the triblock copolymer gel floss fail by the fourth or fifth insertions when inserted in a normal tight gap between normal front teeth and fail on the first or second insertions when used between facing tight contacting amalgam molars.</p><p>The reason why this happens is possibly that at the point where the gel floss is damaged (cut, notched or nicked) a craze front develops as more voids form along the line perpendicular to the floss' elongated direction (i.e., applied tension) resulting in sudden unstoppable fracturing of the bulk material ahead of the notched point causing complete catastrophic failure of the floss.</p><p>Consequentially, its very frustrating to attempt to floss a full set of upper or lower teeth with triblock copolymer gel floss. It is the complete, unstoppable catastrophic failure of the triblock copolymer gel floss in tension while being worked in the gap of the teeth that must be prevented in order for the gel to be useful for flossing.</p><p>Therefore, gels providing greater tear resistance under applied tension are needed before "gels" as a class of materials can be commercialized for use as dental floss. The gap insertion "breaking frequency" of the gel floss must be substantially lowered before the gel can be acceptable by the consumer for flossing. Breaking frequency means the number of flossing cycles to break of a floss where one cycle comprises an insertion and extraction a floss between the teeth gap.</p><p>Block copolymers with polyethylene midblocks alone do not form suitable gels for use in making the gels of the invention. Crystalline midblock regions needs to be balanced with amorphous midblock regions in order to obtain soft, flexible and elastic gels with the desired crystalline properties that are not found in typical SEBS and SEPS gels.</p><p>The polymers forming the gels of the invention comprises crystalline/glassy domain/amorphous structures which are described and illustrate in copending application No. 863,794. Although the structure can be spheroid, cylinders and plates are also within the scope of the present invention. Cylinder and plate structure are obtained with increasing glassy A end blocks. From about 15-30% by weight of A blocks, the block copolymer structure is spheroid. From about 33 about 40% by weight of A blocks, the block copolymer structure becomes cylindrical; and above about 45% A blocks, the structure becomes less cylindrical and more plate like.</p><p>In order to obtain elastic crystal gels forming the floss of the invention, it is necessary that the selective synthesis of butadiene produce sufficient amounts of 1,4 poly(butadiene) that on hydrogenation can exhibit "crystallinity" in the midblocks. In order for the block copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention to exhibit crystallinity, the crystalline midblock segments must contain long runs of --CH.sub.2 -- groups. There should be approximately at least 16 units of --(CH.sub.2)-- in sequence for crystallinity. Only the (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 units can crystallize, and then only if there are at least 4 units of (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 in sequence; alternatively, the polyethylene units are denoted by [--(CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2)--].sub.4, [(--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 ].sup.4 or (--CH.sub.2 --).sup.16. The amount of (--CH2--).sup.16 units forming the (E) midblocks of the block copolymers comprising the crystal gels of the invention should be at least about 20% which amount is capable of exhibiting a melting endotherm in differential scanning calorimeter (DCS) curves.</p><p>Advantageously, the elastomer midblock segment should have a crystallinity of at least about 20% of (--CH.sub.2 --)16 units of the total mole % forming the midblocks of the block copolymer, more advantageously at least about 25%, still more advantageously at least about 30%, especially advantageously at least about 40% and especially more advantageously at least about 50% and higher. Broadly, the crystallinity of the midblocks should range from at least about 20% to about 60%, less broadly from at least about 18% to about 65%, and still less broadly from at least 22% to about 70%.</p><p>The melting endotherm in DSC curves of the crystalline block copolymers comprising at least 20% crystallinity are much higher than conventional amorphous block copolymers. The maximum in the endotherm curves of the crystalline block copolymers occurs at about 40 from greater than about 25 The crystalline block copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention can exhibit melting endotherms (as shown by DSC) of about 25 about 75 the crystalline midblock block copolymers include: about 28 29 34 39 44 49 54 59 64 69 74 79 C., and higher, whereas, the melting endotherm (DSC) for conventional amorphous midblock segment block copolymers are about 10 lower.</p><p>The melting endotherm is seen on heating and a sharp crystallization exotherm is seen on cooling. Such midblock crystallization endothermic and exothermic characteristics are missing from DSC curves of amorphous gels. The crystallization exotherm and fusion endortherm of the crystalline block copolymer gels of the invention are determined by ASTM D 3417 method.</p><p>Generally, the method of obtaining long runs of crystalline --(CH.sub.2)-- is by sequential block copolymer synthesis followed by hydrogenation. The attainment of crystal gels of the instant invention is solely due to the selective polymerization of the butadiene monomer (forming the midblocks) resulting in one or more predetermined amount of 1,4 poly(butadiene) blocks followed by sequential polymerization of additional midblocks and hydrogenation to produce one or more crystalline midblocks of the final block copolymers.</p><p>The crystalline block copolymers are made by sequential block copolymer synthesis, the percentage of crystallinity or (--CH.sub.2 --).sup.16 units should be at least about (0.67).sup.4 or about 20% and actual crystallinity of about 12%. For example, a selectively synthesized S-EB.sub.n -S copolymer having a ratio of 33:67 of 1,2 and 1,4 poly(butadiene) on hydrogenation will result in a midblock with a crystallinity of (0.67).sup.4 or 20%. For sake of simplicity, when n is a subscript of -EB-, n denotes the percentage of (--CH2--).sub.4 units, eg, n=67 or 20% crystallinity which is the percentage of (0.67).sup.4 or "(--CH.sub.2 --).sup.16 " units. Thus, when n=28 or 72% of (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 units, the % crystallinity is (0.72).sup.4 or 26.87% crystallinity attributed to (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.16 units, denoted by -EB.sub.28 -. As a matter of convention, and for purposes of this specification involving hydrogenated polybutadiene: the notation -E- denotes at least about 85% of (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 units. The notation -B- denotes at least about 70% of [--CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)--] units. The notation -EB- denotes between about 15 and 70% [--CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)--] units. The notation -EB.sub.n -- denotes n % [--CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)--] units. For hydrogenated polyisoprene: The notation -EP- denotes about at least 90% [--CH.sub.2 --CH(CH.sub.3)--CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 --] units. The notation -P- denotes about at least greater than about 70% polyisopropylethyene units.</p><p>Likewise, in order to obtain the highly amorphous midblock components such as -B- forming the elastic gels of the floss of the invention, it is necessary that the selective synthesis of butadiene produce sufficient amounts of vinyl or 1,2 poly(butadiene) that on hydrogenation can exhibit "substantially amorphous polybutene" midblocks. The notation -B- denotes greater than above about 70% [--CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)--].sub.n polybutene units and -P- denotes greater than about 70% [--CH(CH--2CH.sub.3)--CH.sub.2 --].sub.n polyisopropylethyene units. The substantially amorphous midblocks -EB.sub.n - and -EP.sub.n - of SEB.sub.n S and SEP.sub.n S (or more simply denoted when n % is greater than about 70% as -B- and -P-) are more advantageously when n % is greater than about 75%, still more advantageously greater than about 80%, and still more advantageously greater than about 85%, and even still more advantageously greater than about 90% or higher. Typically, high polybutene content SEB.sub.n S or simply SBS is made by adding structure modifiers, such as ethers, which gives more 1,2 polybutadiene and after hydrogenation, more polybutene, resulting in less crystallinity, softer block copolymer, lower viscosity, and higher T.sub.g. Likewise, high polyisopropylethyene content SEP.sub.n S or simply S-P-S is made by adding structure modifiers to give more 3,4 structure and after hydrogenation, more polyisopropylethyene, resulting in softer block copolymer, lower viscosity, and higher T.sub.g.</p><p>The major advantages of SEB.sub.n S and SEP.sub.n S over SEBS, SEPS (when n % greater=than about 70%) is the T.sub.g of poly(styrene-ethylene-butylene.sub.&amp;gt;70 -styrene) and poly(styrene-ethylene/propylene-isopropylethyene.sub.&amp;gt;70 -styrene) are much higher; the gel rigidities are lower; and the viscosities are much lower. More specifically, the Tg of SEBS is typically about -58 and the Tg of SEPS is typically about -50 Whereas, the Tg of SEB.sub.n S and SEP.sub.n S with high butylene content and high isopropylethyene content can be advantageously much higher of about less than about -40 more advantageously higher of about -27</p><p>It is extraordinary that where typical SEBS and SEPS gels fails to provide adequate tensile strength, fails to provide adequate tear strength, and fails to provide adequate resistance to high stress rupture suitable for use as dental floss, hereto unknown and unappreciated modification of the midblock structures provide heretofore unrealizable improved higher tensile strength, improved higher tear strength, and improved higher resistance to high stress rupture.</p><p>Theory notwithstanding, SEBS and SEPS gels fail to provide adequate properties for use as dental floss. The following is known:</p><p>i) gels made from typical SEBS which is created from a mixture of 1, 4- and 1,2-polybutadiene to provide a random mixture of ethylene and butylene units adequate to suppress crystallinity (as noted by Legge). Such gels can not provide adequate tear strength and lack adequate resistance to high stress rupture.</p><p>ii) gels made from typical SEPS which is created by hydrogenation of cis-1,4-polyisoprene results in a 1:1 ethylene/propylene elastomer midblock (as noted by Legge). Such gels can not provide adequate tear strength and lack adequate resistance to high stress rupture.</p><p>Contrary to the inferior properties of the above gels 1) and 2), the following gels are found to be superior and of improved high tear strength, improved resistance to high stress rupture and sufficient adequate tensile strength for use as dental floss:</p><p>iii) gels made from an admixture of a high crystalline ethylene content S-E.sub.n B-S block copolymer and a high butylene content S-EB.sub.n -S block copolymer.</p><p>iv) gels made from an admixture of a high crystalline ethylene content S-E.sub.n B-S block copolymer and a high polyisopropylethyene content S-EP.sub.n -S block copolymer.</p><p>v) gels made from an admixture of a high crystalline ethylene content S-E.sub.n B-S block copolymer, a high butylene content S-EB.sub.n -S block copolymer, and a high polyisopropylethyene content S-EP.sub.n -S block copolymer</p><p>vi) S-E-EB.sub.&amp;gt;70 -E-S gels made by coupling S-E-EB.sub.&amp;gt;70.</p><p>vii) S-E-EP.sub.&amp;gt;70 -E-S gels made by coupling S-E-EP.sub.&amp;gt;70.</p><p>viii) gels made from linear, branched, radial, star-shaped, multi-arm or branched block copolymers having sufficient multiple midblock components of high crystalline ethylene content, high butylene content, and/or high isopropylethyene content including all combinations and permutations and mixtures of such block copolymers and as further described below.</p><p>Generally, one or more (E) midblocks can be incorporated at various positions along the midblocks of the block copolymer's. Using the sequential process for block copolymer synthesis, The (E) midblocks can be positioned as follows:</p><p>i) A-E-W-A</p><p>ii) A-E-W-E-A</p><p>iii) A-W-E-W-A</p><p>iv) and etc.</p><p>The highly amorphous or highly crystalline midblock components:</p><p>v) A-W-A</p><p>vi) A-E-A</p><p>The lower flexibility of block copolymer crystal gels due to (E) midblocks can be balanced by the addition of sequentially (W) midblocks. For example, the sequentially synthesized block copolymer S-E-EB-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of amorphous -EB- block. The sequential block copolymer S-E-EB-B-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of amorphous -EB- and -B- midblocks. The sequential block copolymer S-E-EP-E-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of -EP- midblock. The sequential block copolymer S-E-B-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of the -B-, butylene midblock. For S-E-S, where the midblock is substantially crystalline and flexibility low, physical blending with amorphous block copolymers such as S-EB-S, S-B-S, S-EP-S, S-EB-EP-S, (S-EP).sub.n and the like can produce more softer, less rigid, and more flexible crystal gel.</p><p>In additional to the block copolymers S-E-EB-S and S-E-EP-S, S-E-EB-E-S can be made by coupling S-E-EB and S-E-EP-E-S can be made by coupling S-E-EP or by making it sequentially. Multi-arm of such block copolymer can also be made.</p><p>Because of the (E) midblocks, the crystal gels forming the floss of the invention exhibit different physical characteristics and improvements over substantially amorphous gels including damage tolerance, improved crack propagation resistance, improved tear resistance producing knotty tears as opposed to smooth tears, crystalline melting point of at least 28 C., improved resistance to fatigue, higher hysteresis, etc. Moreover, the crystal gels forming the floss when stretched exhibit additional yielding as shown by necking caused by stress induced crystallinity.</p><p>Regarding resistance to fatigue, fatigue (as used herein) is the decay of mechanical properties after repeated application of stress and strain. Fatigue tests give information about the ability of a material to resist the development of cracks or crazes resulting from a large number of deformation cycles. Fatigue test can be conducted by subjecting samples of amorphous and crystal gels to deformation cycles to failure (appearance of cracks, crazes, rips or tears in the gels).</p><p>Tensile strength can be determined by extending a selected gel sample to break as measured at 180 to a spring scale. Likewise, tear strength of a notched sample can be determined by propagating a tear as measured at 180 a 5.0 mm diameter mandrel attached to a spring scale.</p><p>Various block copolymers can be obtained which are amorphous, highly rubbery, and exhibiting minimum dynamic hysteresis:</p><heading>Block copolymer S-EB-S</heading><p>The monomer butadiene can be polymerized in a ether/hydrocarbon solvent to give a 50/50 ratio of 1,2 poly(butadiene)/1,4 poly(butadiene) and on hydrogenation no long runs of --CH.sub.2 -- groups and negligible crystallinity, ie, about (0.5).sup.4 or 0.06 or 6% and actual crystallinity of about 3%.

In the case of Kuraray's S-EB-S polymer 8006 the S:EB weight ratio is about 35:65. In the case of Kuraray's 2005 (SEPS), and 2006 (SEPS), the S:EP weight ratios are 20:80 and 35:65 respectively. The styrene to ethylene-ethylene/propylene (S:EB-EP) ratios of Kuraray's SEPTON 4045, 4055, and 4077 are typically about 37.6, 30, 30 respectively. More typically the (S:EB-EP) and (S:EP) ratios can vary broadly much like S:EB ratios of S-EB-S and (SEB).sub.n from less than 19:81 to higher than 51:49 (as recited above) are possible.

Example of various commercially oils include: ARCO Prime (55, 70, 90, 200, 350, 400 and the like), Duraprime and Tufflo oils (6006, 6016, 6016M, 6026, 6036, 6056, 6206, etc) , other white mineral oils include: Bayol, Bernol, American, Blandol, Drakeol, Ervol, Gloria, Kaydol, Litetek, Lyondell (Duraprime 55, 70, 90, 200, 350, 400, etc), Marcol, Parol, Peneteck, Primol, Protol, Sontex, Witco brand white oils including RR-654-P and the like. Generally, plasticizing oils with average molecular weights less than about 200 and greater than about 700 may also be used (e.g., H-300 (1290 Mn)).</p><p>Comparisons of oil extended S-EB-S triblock copolymers have been described in Shell Chemical Company Technical Bulletin SC:1102-89 (April 1989) "KRATON herein by reference.</p><p>The crystal gels forming the floss can be made non-adhearing, non-sticking, (non-tacky), by incorporating an advantage amount of stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), metal stearates (e.g., calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, etc.), polyethylene glycol distearate, polypropylene glycol ester or fatty acid, and polytetramethylene oxide glycol disterate, waxes, stearic acid and waxes, metal stearate and waxes, metal stearate and stearic acid. The use of stearic acid alone do not reduce tack. The amount of stearic acid is also important. As an example, ratio of 200 grams stearic acid to 2,000 gram of S-EB-S (a ratio of 0.1) will result in spotted tack reduction on the surface of the gel. A ratio of 250 to 2,000 will result in spotted crystallized stearic acid regions on the surface of the gel or spotted tack reduction. A ratio of 300 to 2,000 will result in complete tack reduction with large stearic acid crystallized regions on the surface of the gel. When microcrystalline waxes are incorporated together with stearic acid, the crystallization of stearic acid completely disappears from the surface of the gel. For example excellent result is achieved with 200 grams of stearic acid, 150 grams of microcrystalline wax and 2,000 grams of S-EB-S. The same excellent result is achieved when S-EB-S is adjusted to 3,000 grams, 4,000 grams, etc. The same result is achieved with (I) copolymers as well as in combination with polymers (II) such as SEPS, S-EB-EP-S, (S-EB-EP).sub.n, (SEB).sub.n, (SEP).sub.n polymers. Moreover, when about 50 grams of tetrakistmethylene 3-(3'5'di-tertbutyl-4"-hydroxyphenyl) propionate) methane is use as a tack reducing blooming agent, tack is completely removed from the surface of the gel after two to three weeks of blooming.</p><p>The crystal gels forming the floss can also contain useful amounts of conventionally employed additives such as stabilizers, antioxidants, antiblocking agents, colorants, fragrances, flame retardants, flavors, other polymers in minor amounts and the like to an extend not affecting or substantially decreasing the desired properties.

Lower and higher temperatures can also be utilized depending on the viscosity of the oils and amounts of multiblock copolymers (I) and polymer (II) used. These components blend easily in the melt and a heated vessel equipped with a stirrer is all that is required. Small batches can be easily blended in a test tube using a glass stirring rod for mixing. While conventional large vessels with pressure and/or vacuum means can be utilized in forming large batches of the instant crystal gels in amounts of about 40 lbs or less to 10,000 lbs or more. For example, in a large vessel, inert gases can be employed for removing the composition from a closed vessel at the end of mixing and a partial vacuum can be applied to remove any entrapped bubbles. Stirring rates utilized for large batches can range from about less than 10 rpm to about 40 rpm or higher.</p><p>The crystal gel articles can be formed by blending, injection molding, extruding, spinning, casting, dipping and other conventional methods. For example, Shapes having various cross-section can be extruded. The crystal gels can also be formed directly into articles or remelted in any suitable hot melt applicator and extruded into shaped articles and films or spun into threads, strips, bands, yarns, or other shapes. With respect to various shapes and yarn, its size are conventionally measured in denier (grams/9000 meter), tex (grams/1000 meter), and gage (1/2.54 cm).

These are: (1) tensile strength of about 8 greater; (2) elongation of less than about 1,600% to about 3,000% and higher; (3) elasticity modules of about 10.sup.4 dyne/cm.sup.2 to about 10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2 and greater; (4) shear modules of about 10.sup.4 dyne/cm.sup.2 to about 10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2 and greater as measured with a 1, 2, and 3 kilogram load at 23 less than about 2 gram Bloom to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher as measured by the gram weight required to depress a gel a distance of 4 mm with a piston having a cross-sectional area of 1 square cm at 23 C.; (6) tear propagation resistance greater than the tear resistance of amorphous S-EB-S gels at corresponding gel rigidities; (7) resistance to fatigue greater than the fatigue resistance of amorphous S-EB-S gels at corresponding gel rigidities; (8) and substantially 100% snap back recovery when extended at a crosshead separation speed of 25 cm/minute to 1,200% at 23 measured at a crosshead separation speed of 25 cm/minute at 23</p><p>The crystal gels can be formed in any shape; the original shape can be deformed into another shape (to contact a regular or regular surface) by pressure and upon removal of the applied pressure, the composition in the deformed shape will recover back to its original shape.</p><p>For purposes of dental flossing, while flossing between two closely adjacent teeth, especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial contact points and more especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial amalgam alloy metal contact points showing no gap between the teeth, it is critical that the crystal gel resist tearing, shearing, and crazing while being stretched to a high degree in such situations. For example, dental crystal gel floss can take the form of a disk where the segments of the circumference of the disk is stretched for flossing between the teeth. Other shaped articles suitable for flossing include threads, strips, yarns, tapes, etc., mentioned above.</p><p>In all cases, the tear strength of crystal gels are higher than that of amorphous gels. For example, the crystal gels made from high viscosity S-E-EB-S and S-E-EP-S copolymers are resistant to tearing when under high stress or shear than high viscosity typical S-EB-S and S-EP-S copolymer gels.</p><p>In order for gels to be useful as a dental floss, it must overcome the difficult barriers of high shearing and high tearing under extreme elongation and tension loads. The difficulties that the gels must overcome during flossing can be viewed as follows: during the action of flossing, the gel is stretched from no less than about 200% to about 1,100% or higher, the gel floss is deformed as it is pulled down with tearing action between the contacting surfaces of the teeth, then, the wedge of gel floss is sheared between the inner contacting surfaces of the teeth, and finally, the elongated wedged of gel floss is pulled upwards and out between the surfaces of the teeth. The forces encountered in the act of flossing are: tension, shearing, tearing under extreme tension.</p><p>This invention advances the flossing art by providing strong, soft, and extreme tear resistant gels made from multiblock copolymers which gels are substantially as soft as the gums surrounding the teeth.</p><p>Gel floss formed from the gels has many advantages over conventional dental floss such as regular and extra fine waxed and unwaxed nylon floss, spongy nylon fiber floss, and waxed and unwaxed expanded and unexpended teflon floss. Such conventional floss are not recommended for use by children, since a slip or sudden snap in forcing the floss between the teeth may cause injury to the gums which often times results in bleeding. For sensitive gums and inflamed gums which has become red and puffy, it is difficult to floss at, near, and below the gumline. The soft gel floss with softness substantially matching the softness of the gums are of great advantage for use by children and for flossing teeth surrounded by sensitive and tender gums.</p><p>The shear resistant characteristics of the gels can be indirectly determined by subjecting the gel to the shear forces of a pair of twisting strings and the resulting inward pulling forces of the twisting strings can be directly read off of a spring scale. As a pair of strings are gradually twisted, typical values will range from less than one pound to fifty pounds and greater. As the string is being twisted (simulating increased shearing forces), the measured pulling forces can range from a low value of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 . . . to values of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 pounds and greater.</p><p>Gel material of low strength can not resist the tremendous shearing action of the twisting strings. The twisting action of the strings can exhibit a first order twist, a second order twist, or higher order twists. A first order twist refers to one or more twists of a pair of strings (i.e., a pair of strings when twisted together forms a small tight binding helix). A second order twist refers to one or more large binding helixes build up by a pair of strings that have been twisted beyond the maximum number of twist which normally produce small tight binding helixes of the first order kind. Similarly, a third order twist refers to a much larger tightly binding helix build up by the maximum number of second order twists produced by the pair of twisting strings. The third order twist may be manifested by the appearance of a branch of two or more twist of the first order twisting strings.</p><p>The order of twisting will increase (from a one, two, three, and higher order twist) until the rubber band breaks. Likewise, a looped string with one end attached to a spring scale and the other end attached to a fixed anchor can be twisted into a first, second, third, and higher ordered twist state. This method can be utilized to directly measure the force generated for each ordered twist states. The static force generated by twisting a string on a spring scale is a way of determining the shear force generated in the shearing action of forcing the gel floss between two closely contacting teeth when flossing.</p><p>In considering dental flossing criteria, one or more of the following conditions can be regarded as critical factors for dental flossing gels.</p><p>SHEAR RESISTANT CRITERIA</p><p>For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should withstand a twisting string shearing force of at least about 5 Kg, more advantageously at least about 8 Kg, and still more advantageously at least about 10 Kg of inward pulling force of a pair of twisting strings measured directly on a spring scale.</p><p>FLOSSING CYCLE CRITERIA</p><p>For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously be able to perform at least 4 flossing cycles, more advantageously 8 cycles, and still more advantageously of about 20 cycles without breaking apart when a 3.0 mm diameter gel strand is tested on a set of simulated upper front teeth fully contacting under a uniform spring load of (0.9027 Kg) two pounds. The simulated upper front teeth comprises two small stainless steel rollers (3/8" dia.) facing lengthwise parallel and forced together so as to form a contact length of 1/2 inches under a spring load of two pounds as measured by a Entran load cell adjusted by a straight micrometer at room temperature.</p><p>GEL STRENGTH CRITERIA</p><p>For the gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously exhibit a tensile strength of at least 5 Kg/cm.sup.2 (when extended to break as measured at 180 mandrel attached to a spring scale) and more advantageously at least 8 Kg/cm.sup.2, and still more advantageously of about 10 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher. The high and gels useful as dental floss can exhibit tensile strengths at break of at least 20 Kg/cm.sup.2, more advantageously of at least 40 Kg/cm.sup.2, and exceptionally more advantageously at least 60 Kg/cm.sup.2. Typically, the tensile strengths range from about 20 Kg/cm.sup.2 to about 110 Kg/cm2 and higher, more typically from about 30 Kg/cm.sup.2 to 80 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher, especially more typically from about 40 Kg/cm.sup.2 to about 90 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher, and exceptionally typically from about 50 Kg/cm.sup.2 to about 100 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher.</p><p>PROPAGATING TEAR CRITERIA</p><p>As a minimum, for the Gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously exhibit a propagating tear force (when propagating a tear as measured at 180 diameter mandrel attached to a spring scale) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 3 Kg/cm and higher. The gels useful as dental floss can exhibit tear strengths of at least 4 Kg/cm and higher, more advantageously of at least 6 Kg/cm and higher, exceptionally more advantageously of at least 8 Kg/cm and higher. Typically, the tear propagation strength can range from about 5 Kg/cm to about 20 Kg/cm and higher, more typically from about less than 5 Kg/cm to about 25 Kg/cm and higher, especially more typically form about less than 6 Kg/cm to about 30 Kg/cm and higher, and exceptionally more typically from about less than 8 Kg/cm to about 35 Kg/cm and higher.</p><p>For the Gels to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously exhibit a propagating tension tear force (when a cylindrical sample is notched and a tear is initiated at the notched area and propagated past its maximum cylindrical diameter by length-wise stretching of the cylindrical sample) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 4 Kg/cm and higher. The extreme tear resistant gels typically will exhibit even higher tension tear values.</p><p>RIGIDITY CRITERIA</p><p>The rigidities of the extreme tear resistant useful for flossing can advantageously range from about 350 gram to about 1,800 gram Bloom, more advantageously from about 400 gram to about 1,500 gram Bloom, especially more advantageously from about 450 gram to about 1,200 gram Bloom, still more advantageously from about 450 gram to about 1,000 gram Bloom, and less advantageously at values of greater than 1,800 gram Bloom.</p><p>HIGH STRESS RUPTURE CRITERIA</p><p>This is demonstrated by forming very soft gel samples, for example 100 parts copolymer to 800 parts plasticizing oil. The soft gel is made in a 16 mm point about its cross-section and gripped lengthwise tightly in the left hand about this cross-section point and a length of exposed gel is gripped lengthwise around the adjacent cross-section point tightly by the right hand as close to the left hand as possible without stretching. With the two hands gripping the gel sample's cross-section about the notched point, the hands are moved in opposite directions to tear apart the gel sample at the cross-section point. The high shearing action by the gripping hands is done at the fastest speed possible as can be performed by human hands. Using this demonstration, the crystal gels will not easily break or tear completely apart, whereas, amorphous S-EB-S and S-EP-S gels break or tears apart easily. Likewise the various crystal gels of the invention described herein are tested and found to be more resistant to high stress rupture than typical SEBS and SEPS gels. For floss, the improved resistance high stress rupture is essential.</p><p>In general, as a minimum, the flossing gels should exhibit several critical properties, including advantageously the ability to:</p><p>(1) withstand a shearing force of at least about 5 Kg under the string twisting test described above,</p><p>(2) perform at least 4 flossing cycles without breaking apart when tested on a set of simulated upper front teeth fully contacting under a uniform spring load of two pound,</p><p>(3) exhibit a tensile strength of at least 5 Kg/cm.sup.2 and higher,</p><p>(4) exhibit a propagating tear force at 180 least about 1 Kg/cm, and</p><p>(5) exhibit a propagating tension tear force (on a notched cylindrical sample) of at least about 1 Kg/cm.</p><p>For use as a dental floss, the gel is made (by extruding, spinning, casting, etc) as a continuous gel strand, the gel strand can be in the shape of a fiber of a selected diameter (from less than about 0.15 to about 5.0 mm and greater) as a continuous tape having a selected width and thickness (less than 0.10 mm thin to about 5.0 mm and thicker) or in any desired shape suitable for flossing. The fiber, tape or a selected shape is then cut to a desired length, rolled up and placed into a dispenser suitable for containing and dispensing a measured use amount of gel floss. The continuous fiber and tape can be partly cut or notched for measured single or multiple use. When the floss is pulled from the dispenser to a point showing the notched or cut mark on the length of gel floss, the lid is pushed down on the gel floss nipping it and allowing the floss to be further pulled and separated at the notched or cut point. Additionally, a suitable floss dispenser containing a measured length of gel floss can be fitted with a cutting edge attached to its lid or on its body and the uncut and un-notched gel floss can be dispensed from the dispensing container and cut at the desired measured use length by pressing close the dispenser cutting edge down on the floss so as to nip and cut the gel or by simply closing the dispenser lid or running the gel along the cutting edge on the dispenser body separating a useful length of gel floss.</p><p>In practice, typically during flossing, a gel strand will under go various deformations, some of these deformations can be measured, including original shape, extended shape under tension, nipping force, and nipped deformation under a measured force and width. Typically, any shaped gel strand can be used for flossing, a square cross-section, a circular cross-section, a rectangular cross-section, round, oval, etc. For example, a 2.35 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.14 mm thickness (along a 3 mm uniform width of its cross-section) by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 16.78:1; a 1.89 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.14 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 13.5:1; a 2.75 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.19 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 14.4:1; and a 2.63 mm diameter strand when extended under a force of 2.5 kg can be nipped down to 0.19 mm thickness by a force of 0.9072 Kg (2.0 pound force), a reduction of 13.8:1, the cross-section of the gel floss can be reduced to any degree by stretching and nipping (from less than about 1% to about 1,600% and higher). Advantageously, a gel having the required strength, tear resistance, gel rigidity, and other characteristics described can be formed into a floss of any selected cross-section and thickness provided the floss is capable of being stretched when flossing under tension without breaking. Typically the stretching or pulling force is from about less than 0.1 Kg to about 3 Kg and higher. The cross-section of the strand of gel floss should be capable of being nipped by a 0.9027 Kg (2 pounds) force applied across a width of 3 mm from its original cross-sectional dimensions to a nipped thickness of about 3.0 mm to about 0.02 mm and lower, more advantageously from about 2.5 mm to about 0.04 mm and lower, still more advantageously from about 2.0 mm to about 0.08 mm and lower; especially advantageously from about 1.5 mm to about 0.15 mm and lower; especially more advantangeously from about 1.2 mm to about 0.20 mm and lower; especially still more advantageously from about 1.0 mm to about 0.25 mm and lower.</p><p>The gels made from higher viscosity copolymers (i) are resistant to breaking when sheared than triblock copolymer gels. This can be demonstrated by forming a very soft gel, for example 100 parts copolymer to 800 parts plasticizing oil. The soft gel is cut into a strip of 2.5 cm in the left hand about its cross-section and an exposed part of the gel strip being gripped lengthwise around its cross-section tightly by the right hand as close to the left hand as possible without stretching. With the two hands gripping the gel strip's cross-section, the hands are moved in opposite directions to shear apart the gel strip at its cross-section. The shearing action by the gripping hands is done at the fastest speed possible as can be performed by human hands. The shearing action is performed at a fraction of a second, possible at about 0.5 seconds. Using this demonstration, the copolymer (I) gels will not easily break completely apart as would gels formed from triblock copolymers. In some cases, it will take two, three, or more attempts to shear a high viscosity copolymer (I) gel strip this way. Whereas, a lower viscosity triblock copolymer gel strip can be sheared apart on the first try. For gels made from copolymers with viscosities of 5 wt % solution in Toluene, their shear resistance will decrease with decreasing viscosity. For example, the shear strengths as tested by hand shearing described above of gels made from copolymers having viscosities of 150, 120, 110, 105, 95, 90, 89, 85, 70, 60, 58, 48, 42, 40, 35, 28, 27, 25, 21 cps, and the like can be expected to decrease with decreasing viscosity.</p><p>The tensile strengths of multiblock copolymer gels made from higher viscosity copolymers (I) can be slightly lower than or equal to the tensile strengths of gels made from lower solution viscosity triblock copolymers (II).</p><p>Strands of gels comprising higher viscosity multiblock copolymers will perform better than gel strands made from gels of lower viscosity triblock copolymers when used in flossing amalgam molars and more than three times better when used in flossing front teeth.</p><p>Gels, in general, will exhibit higher tensile and greater tear resistance than their parent gels containing higher concentrations of plasticizer.</p><p>As compared to spongy nylon, regular waxed nylon, and extra fine unwaxed nylon when flossing amalgam molars, the performance of multiblock copolymer gels are on the average substantially better.</p><p>While advantageous components and formulation ranges based on the desired properties of the multiblock copolymer gels nave been disclosed herein.
