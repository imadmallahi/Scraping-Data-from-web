The additive composition comprises a polymeric condensation product formed by the reaction of an aliphatic aldehyde or ketone, or a reactive equivalent, with at least one ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid.
<img id="iaf01" orientation="unknown" wi="147" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" file="imgaf001.tif" inline="no" he="105"/></p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="p0001">This invention relates to the use of an additive composition to improve the conductivity characteristics of fuel oils.</p><p num="p0002">A consequence of refining processes employed to reduce diesel fuel sulphur and aromatic contents is a reduction in the electrical conductivity of the fuel. The insulating properties of low sulphur fuels represent a potential hazard to refiners, distributors and customers due to the potential for static charge accumulation and discharge. Static charges can occur during pumping and especially filtration of the fuel, the release of this charge accumulation as a spark constituting a significant risk in highly flammable environments. Such risks are minimised during fuel processing and handling through appropriate earthing of fuel lines and tanks combined with the use of anti-static additives.

These are derived from polyalkylenes of greater than 250 mass units, which are themselves preferably derived from C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> alkenes and more preferably from butene and/or isobutene. They are prepared by linking ammonia, amines, polyamines, alkylamines or alkanolamines to and/or between these polymers. A variety of methods can be used to achieve this, for example routes via chlorination, hydroformylation, epoxidation and ozonolysis are known in the art. Typical examples, which are also well known in the art, are polyisobutene monoamine ("PIBA") and polyisobutene-ethylenediamine ("PIB-EDA"). Further examples are described in EP 244616 and WO 98/28346. The ratio of hydrocarbyl units to amine units is 1:1 to 2.5:1, preferably 1.2:1 to 1.5:1. A number of acylated, nitrogen-containing compounds having a hydrocarbyl substituent of at least 10 carbon atoms and made by reacting a carboxylic acid acylating agent, for example an anhydride or ester, with an amino compound are known to those skilled in the art. In such compositions the acylating agent is linked to the amino compound through an imido, amido, amidine or acyloxy ammonium linkage. The hydrocarbyl substituent of 10 carbon atoms may be found either in the portion of the molecule derived from the carboxylic acid acylating agent, or in the portion derived from the amino compound, or in both. Preferably, however, it is found in the acylating agent portion. The acylating agent can vary from formic acid and its acylating derivatives to acylating agents having high molecular weight hydrocarbyl substituents of up to 50, 100 or 200 carbon atoms. The amino compounds can vary from ammonia itself to amines having hydrocarbyl substituents of up to about 30 carbon atoms.</p><p num="p0072">A preferred class of acylated amino compounds are those made by reacting an acylating agent having a hydrocarbyl substituent of at least 10 carbon atoms and a nitrogen compound characterized by the presence of at least one -NH- group. Typically, the acylating agent will be a mono- or polycarboxylic acid (or reactive equivalent thereof) such as a substituted succinic or propionic acid and the amino compound will be a polyamine or mixture of polyamines, most typically, a mixture of<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> ethylene polyamines. The amine also may be a hydroxyalkyl-substituted polyamine. The hydrocarbyl substituent in such acylating agents preferably averages at least about 30 or 50 and up to about 400 carbon atoms.</p><p num="p0073">Illustrative of hydrocarbyl substituent groups containing at least 10 carbon atoms are n-decyl, n-dodecyl, tetrapropenyl, n-octadecyl, oleyl, chlorooctadecyl, triicontanyl, etc. Generally, the hydrocarbyl substituents are made from homo- or interpolymers (e.g. copolymers, terpolymers) of mono- and di-olefins having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, isobutene, butadiene, isoprene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, etc. Typically, these olefins are 1-monoolefins. This substituent can also be derived from the halogenated (e.g. chlorinated or brominated) analogs of such homo-or interpolymers.</p><p num="p0074">The hydrocarbyl substituents are predominantly saturated. The hydrocarbyl substituents are also predominantly aliphatic in nature, that is, they contain no more than one non-aliphatic moiety (cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or aromatic) group of 6 or less carbon atoms for every 10 carbon atoms in the substituent. Usually, however, the substituents contain no more than one such non-aliphatic group for every 50 carbon atoms, and in many cases, they contain no such non-aliphatic groups at all; that is, the typically substituents are purely aliphatic. Typically, these purely aliphatic substituents are alkyl or alkenyl groups.</p><p num="p0075">A preferred source of the substituents are poly(isobutene)s obtained by polymerization of a C<sub>4</sub> refinery stream having a butene content of 35 to 75 weight per cent and isobutene content of 30 to 60 weight per cent in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride.

Chlorination involves merely contacting the polyalkene with chlorine gas until the desired amount of chlorine is incorporated into the chlorinated polyalkene. Chlorination is generally carried out at a temperature of about 75°C to about 125°C. If desired, a diluent can be used in the chlorination procedure. Suitable diluents for this purpose include poly- and perchlorinated and/or fluorinated alkanes and benzenes.</p><p num="p0078">The second step in the procedure is to react the chlorinated polyalkene with the maleic reactant at a temperature usually within the range of about 100°C to about 200°C. The mole ratio of chlorinated polyalkene to maleic reactant is usually about 1:1. However, a stoichiometric excess of maleic reactant can be used, for example, a mole ratio of 1:2. If an average of more than about one chloro group per molecule of polyalkene is introduced during the chlorination step, then more than one mole of maleic reactant can react per molecule of chlorinated polyalkene. It is normally desirable to provide an excess of maleic reactant; for example, an excess of about 5% to about 50%, for example 25% by weight. Unreacted excess maleic reactant may be stripped from the reaction product, usually under vacuum.</p><p num="p0079">Another procedure for preparing substituted succinic acid acylating agents utilizes a process described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,912,764 and U.K. Pat. No. 1,440,219. According to that process, the polyalkene and the maleic reactant are first reacted by heating them together in a direct alkylation procedure. When the direct alkylation step is completed, chlorine is introduced into the reaction mixture to promote reaction of the remaining unreacted maleic reactants. According to the patents, 0.3 to 2 or more moles of maleic anhydride are used in the reaction for each mole of polyalkene. The direct alkylation step is conducted at temperatures to 180°C to 250°C. During the chlorine-introducing stage, a temperature of 160°C to 225°C is employed.</p><p num="p0080">The attachment of the hydrocarbyl substituent to the succinic moiety may alternatively be achieved via the thermally-driven 'ene' reaction, in the absence of chlorine. Use of such a material is the acylating agent (i) leads to products having<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> particular advantages; for example, chlorine-free products having excellent detergency and lubricity properties.

Base fuel 2 was used (see Table 4). Each data point label describes the nature of the HBFC tested. For example, HBFC 2-EH refers to a 2-ethylhexyl ester species; and HBFC 2-EH:mesitylene (3:1) refers to a compound where the 2-ethylhexyl ester species is copolymerised with mesitylene, the ratio of the ester to the mesitylene being 3:1 All compounds were added to a low sulphur diesel fuel at a total treat rate of 50wppm, the ratio of the HBFC to PMA being 1:1 by weight. The conductivity of the base fuel was 2 pSm<sup>-1</sup>. High conductivity was observed for all of the HBFC species, with the maximum conductivity being observed for those compositions containing isodecyl ester HBFC species. The conductivity of the base fuel treated with 50wppm of the PMA alone was ca. 5 pSm<sup>-1</sup> The synergistic effect of the PMA species is clearly demonstrated. Taking one example, the conductivity of the fuel sample treated with 50wppm of HBFC isodecyl was 68 pSm<sup>-1</sup> which compares with 365 pSm<sup>-1</sup> for the same HBFC used in combination with the PMA. This is five times greater than the value which would be predicted from a simple summation of the individual effects of the two additive species.</p><p num="p0126">Investigation into the mechanism of the synergistic interaction between HBFC and other components was performed. Base fuel 2 was used. The data in Fig. 2 show that HBFC is not synergistic with all amine species. No synergy is observed with tribenzyl amine (a tertiary amine), Naugalube 438L (a secondary aryl amine) nor Armeen 2C ( a secondary alkyl amine). However, with the polymethacrylates, there is an almost linear response between conductivity synergy and the amine content of the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> polymethacrylate. The polymethacrylates 8394.014, 015 and 018 are isodecyl methacrylate dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate copolymers of ~20,000 molecular weight where the weight% content of the aminic monomer is shown above each bar in Fig. 2. The result for T4150 indicates that molecular weight has little impact (T4150 is ~300,000 molecular weight). It should be noted that the polymethacrylate materials were added as 50% dilutions in Solvesso 150 (42% for T4150). This means that on an active ingredient (AI) basis, a 1:1 mixture is in fact a 2:1 HBFC:PMA mixture.</p><p num="p0127">The effect of composition was further investigated with HBFC and polymethacrylate 8394.018. Base fuel 2 was used. The data presented in Fig. 3 show that with functional polymethacrylates below a 1:1 ratio (2:1 based on AI), the conductivity increases almost linearly. Above this value, the conductivity peaks. It is noteworthy that compositions which have a large proportion of the PMA species (e.g. 1:9, or 1:6 ratios) still show good conductivity, notwithstanding the very low inherent conductivity of the PMA species.</p><p num="p0128">The effect of the polymethacrylate backbone was investigated. The results shown in Fig. 4 compare the polymethacrylates discussed in relation to Fig. 2 above, which were based on isodecyl methacrylate, with similar materials based on a 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate backbone. Base fuel 2 was used. As before, the amine content of the polymers was 1.5, 2.5 or 5wt%. High conductivity was observed for all species and in all cases, higher values were obtained from the 2-ethylhexyl species with HBFC. Significant synergy was again observed, the inherent conductivity of the PMA species being at most 13 pSm<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p num="p0129">A wide range of other components were tested for synergistic conductivity with HBFC.
