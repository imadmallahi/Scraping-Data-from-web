Although the patent does not provide any in vivo data of intestinal absorption, it mentions<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> inter alia the oral administration of these oligosaccharides by gastro-resistant capsules, tablets, lozenges, pills or liposomes.</p><heading><b>Summary of the invention</b></heading><p num="p0008">It is the object of the present invention the provision of new compositions for oral administration comprising a N-acetylated oversulfated heparin, wherein the composition is not in a gastro-resistant capsule, tablet, lozenge, pill or liposome.</p><p num="p0009">In fact, it has been found that N-acetylated supersulfated heparin (NASSH) is capable of transiting the gastric section without major degradation and can be absorbed in the intestinal tract resulting in a high antithrombotic activity.</p><heading><b>Detailed description of the invention</b></heading><p num="p0010">The heparin derivatives for use in the present invention are characterized by the following parameters: percentage of N-acetylation &gt;50%, preferably higher than 70%, degree of sulfation &gt;2.5, preferably higher than 2.8, most preferably higher than 3, weight average molecular weight comprised between 1,600 and 10,000.</p><p num="p0011">It was totally unexpected in view of the prior art that the N-acetylated oversulfated heparin of the present invention maintains the characteristics of absorption in the intestinal tract while having a lower degree of sulphation than ssLMWH; it is even more surprising that it is possible to administer NASSH orally without protecting it with a gastro-resistant capsule and without the use of any carrier system such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles prepared with biodegradable poly-epsilon-caprolactone and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and positively charged polymers, or carrier molecules such as sodium N-(8[2-hydroxybenzoyl]amino)caprylate. Without being bound by any theory, it appears that the NASSH presents a balance of stability and bioavailability which makes it very suitable for oral administration.</p><p num="p0012">The molecular weight of the NASSH useful in the present invention depends on the type of application. In fact, it is known that the reduction of Mw of heparin normally leads to a loss of active sites for antithrombotic activity. Thus, when considering the use of heparin as an antithrombotic drug, it is preferred to prepare a NASSH with an average molecular weight by weight comprised between 4,000 and 8,000.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p num="p0013">NASSH according to the invention can be prepared according to several routes. Any process which combines a depolymerization step, a sulfation step and a N-acetylation step in any order is suitable for the preparation of NASSH for use in the present invention as long as the final supersulfated N-acertylated heparin fulfils the following parameters: percentage of N-acetylation &gt;50%, degree of sulfation &gt;2.5 and Mw comprised between 1,600 and 10,000.</p><p num="p0014">N-acetylation is well known in the art. To prepare N-acetylated heparin, heparin is first N-desulfated by treatment either with aqueous acid solution or with a mixture dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/water or methanol at high temperature. It is also possible, by dosing the reaction conditions, to obtain only a partly N-desulfated heparin. N-desulfated heparin is afterwards N-acetylated e.g. by reaction with acetic anhydride in aqueous base.</p><p num="p0015">Sulfation can be performed in several ways. One possible way of sulfating heparin is by dissolving it in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMSO, dimethylformamide (DMF), formamide, hexamethylenphosphotriamide (HMPT) or acetonitrile and contacting it with a sulfating agent such as sulfur trioxide complex with an organic base, or chlorosulfonic acid in pyridine.</p><p num="p0016">As an example, heparin can be first N-acetylated and then supersulfated by using a sulfuric acid/chlorosulfonic acid mixture. Depending on the reaction time and temperature the reaction can lead to a depolymerization reaction as well. Thus, according to the reaction conditions, a supersulfated heparin having Mw comprised between 1,600 and 10,000 is obtained</p><p num="p0017">If the sulfation method does not lead to depolymerization of heparin, it is necessary to apply a depolymerization step. Depolymerization of heparin can be obtained by chemical or physical treatment.

Given the maximal prolongation of the TcT observed with 4 mg/kg hypersulphated heparins, a lower dose was tested. Here too, in order to assess whether a slight residual antithrombin activity could be detected a diluted TcT test was performed, a condition that allows to detect minimal antithrombin activity (Tab. 10).<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --><tables id="tabl0010" num="0010"><table frame="topbot"><title><b>Tab. 10 - Drugs administered by i.v. route 2 min (dose 2 mg/kg) before blood sampling (TcT and anti Xa diluted)</b></title><tgroup cols="3" colsep="0"><colspec colwidth="57mm" colnum="1" colname="col1"/><colspec colwidth="54mm" colnum="2" colname="col2"/><colspec colwidth="55mm" colnum="3" colname="col3"/><thead><row><entry align="center" valign="top"/><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>TcT (sec)</b></entry><entry align="center" valign="top"><b>Anti Xa (U/ml)</b></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry align="center">UFH</entry><entry align="center">167</entry><entry char="." align="char" charoff="44">1.25</entry></row><row><entry align="center">ENOXA</entry><entry align="center">167</entry><entry char="." align="char" charoff="44">2.02</entry></row><row><entry align="center">Comp.
