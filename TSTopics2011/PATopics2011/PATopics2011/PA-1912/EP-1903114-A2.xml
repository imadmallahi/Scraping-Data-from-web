One or more sialic acid residues are attached to an oligosaccharide or carbohydrate core moiety, which in turn is attached to a hydrophobic lipid (ceramide) structure which generally is embedded in the cell membrane. The ceramide moiety includes a long chain base (LCB) portion and a fatty acid (FA) portion. Gangliosides, as well as other glycolipids and their structures in general, are discussed in, for example, <nplcit id="ncit0001" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Lehninger, Biochemistry (Worth Publishers, 1981) pp. 287-295</text></nplcit> and <nplcit id="ncit0002" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Devlin, Textbook of Biochemistry (Wiley-Liss, 1992</text></nplcit>). Gangliosides are classified according to the number of monosaccharides in the carbohydrate moiety, as well as the number and location of sialic acid groups present in the carbohydrate moiety. Monosialogangliosides are given the designation "GM", disialogangliosides are designated "GD", trisialogangliosides "GT", and tetrasialogangliosides are designated "GQ". Gangliosides can be classified further depending on the position or positions of the sialic acid residue or residues bound. Further classification is based on the number of saccharides present in the oligosaccharide core, with the subscript "1" designating a ganglioside that has four saccharide residues (Gal-GalNAc-Gal-Glc-Ceramide), and the subscripts "2", "3" and "4" representing trisaccharide (GalNAc-Gal-Glc-Ceramide), disaccharide (Gal-Glc-Ceramide) and monosaccharide (Gal-Ceramide) gangliosides, respectively.</p><p num="p0003">Gangliosides are most abundant in the brain, particularly in nerve endings. They are believed to be present at receptor sites for neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, and can also act as specific receptors for other biological macromolecules, including interferon, hormones, viruses, bacterial toxins, and the like. Gangliosides are have<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> been used for treatment of nervous system disorders, including cerebral ischemic strokes. <i>See, e.g.,</i><nplcit id="ncit0003" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Mahadnik et al.

The methods involve the enzymatic transfer of carbohydrates, including sialic acids, to a sphingoid precursor. In particular, the methods involve contacting the sphingoid precursor with one or more glycosyltransferases and the corresponding sugar donor moiety for the glycosyltransferases, and other reactants required for glycosyltransferase activity, for a sufficient time and under appropriate conditions to transfer the sugar or sugars from the donor moiety to the sphingoid precursor. In some embodiments, one or more of the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> enzymatic reactions is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent, which increases the efficiency of the glycosylation reaction. Another way to increase the efficiency of the reaction is to use a glycosyltransferase cycle to generate the nucleotide sugar donor moiety. The enzymatic step is typically preceded by hydrolysis of the fatty acid moiety from the ceramide; a fatty acid moiety can be reattached after completion of the glycosyltransferase reaction. As much as 100% efficiency is obtainable using the methods of the invention.</p><p num="p0007">In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for adding one or more sialic acid residues to a glycosylated ceramide to form a ganglioside. The glycosylated ceramide is contacted with a sialyltransferase and a sialic acid donor moiety and other reactants required for sialyltransferase activity, under conditions such that sialic acid is transferred from the sialic acid donor moiety to the saccharide moiety of the glycosylated ceramide.</p><p num="p0008">Accordingly, some embodiments of the invention provide methods of enzymatically synthesizing a glycosphingoid that involve contacting a sphingoid with a glycosyltransferase reaction mixture that includes: a) one or more glycosyltransferases, b) a corresponding nucleotide sugar for each glycosyltransferase, and c) other reactants required for glycosyltransferase activity. The reaction mixture is incubated for a sufficient time and under appropriate conditions to transfer the sugar or sugars from the nucleotide sugar to the sphingoid to form a glycosylated sphingoid. The methods include at least one efficiency enhancing step selected from the group consisting of including an organic solvent in the glycosyltransferase reaction mixture, and using a glycosyltransferase cycle to generate the nucleotide sugar. If further enhancement of efficiency is desired, the fatty acid can be removed form the sphingoid prior to the glycosyltransferase reaction.</p><p num="p0009">In additional embodiments, the methods of the invention further involve contacting the glycosylated sphingoid that is produced in the first reaction mixture with a second glycosyltransferase reaction mixture that includes: a) an additional glycosyltransferase, b) a corresponding nucleotide sugar for the additional glycosyltransferase, and c) other reactants required for activity of the additional glycosyltransferase.

The methods involve contacting a glycosylated or unglycosylated ceramide or sphingoid with a glycosyltransferase and a sugar donor moiety for a sufficient time and under appropriate reaction conditions to transfer the sugar from the donor moiety to the ceramide or sphingoid. In some embodiments, the enzymatic reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which can increase the efficiency of the reaction.

The methods of the invention involve the use of one or more glycosyltransferases to synthesize glycosphingoids, including gangliosides and other glycosphingoids. Through use of a glycosyltransferase to link a desired carbohydrate to the precursor molecule, one can achieve a desired linkage with high specificity. In presently preferred embodiments, the methods of the invention involve the removal of the fatty acid moiety from the sphingoid precursor prior to the glycosyltransferase reaction, and/or the use of an organic solvent to facilitate the reaction.</p><p num="p0019">The choice of glycosyltransferase(s) used in a given synthesis method of the invention will depend upon the acceptor which is used as the starting material and the desired end product. A method can involve the use of more than one glycosyltransferase, where more than one saccharide is to be added. The multiple glycosyltransferase reactions can be carried out simultaneously or sequentially. To obtain sufficient amounts of glycosyltransferase for large-scale reaction, a nucleic acid that encodes the enzyme can be cloned and expressed as a recombinant soluble enzyme by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p> <p num="p0020">In some embodiments, the invention allows one to synthesize a glycosphingolipid starting from a ceramide or other non-glycosylated sphingoid. The initial enzyme involved in synthesis of a glycoceramide from a ceramide precursor is, depending on the desired end product, either a ceramide glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.80, for glucosylceramide) or a ceramide galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.45, for galactosylceramide) (Step 1). For review of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, <i>see</i>, <i>e.g.,</i><nplcit id="ncit0016" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Ichikawa and Hirabayashi (1998) Trends Cell Biol. 8:198-202</text></nplcit>. Accordingly, when the methods of the invention are used to synthesize a glycosphingolipid using a non-glycosylated ceramide or sphingoid as the starting material, the reaction mixture will include one of these enzymes. Ceramide glucosyltransferases are available from various sources. For example, the human nucleotide sequence is known (GenBank Accession No. D50840; <nplcit id="ncit0017" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Ichikawa et al. (1996) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4638-4643</text></nplcit>), so one can use recombinant methods to obtain the enzyme. The nucleotide sequence of the human ceramide galactosyltransferase also has been reported (GenBank Accession No. U62899; <nplcit id="ncit0018" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Kapitonov and Yu (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 232: 449-453</text></nplcit>), and thus the enzyme is easily obtainable. The acceptor used in these reactions can be any of N-acylsphingosine, sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine. Suitable donor nucleotide sugars for the glycosyltransferase include UDP-Glc and CDP-Glc, while the galactosyltransferase typically uses UDP-Gal as a donor.</p> <p num="p0021">In other embodiments, an acceptor saccharide for a sialyltransferase or other glycosyltransferase is present on the precursor molecule to be modified upon <i>in vivo</i> synthesis of the precursor. For example, one can use as the starting material a glycosylceramide or other glycosphingoid. Such glycosphingoids can be sialylated or otherwise glycosylated using the methods of the invention to add additional saccharide residues to those that are already present on the precursor. In some embodiments, the additional saccharide residues are added without prior modification of the glycosylation pattern of the glycosphingolipid starting material. Alternatively, the invention provides methods of altering the glycosylation pattern of a glycosphingolipid prior to adding the additional saccharide residues. If the starting glycosphingolipid does not provide a suitable acceptor for the glycosyltransferase which catalyzes a desired saccharide addition, one can modify the glycosphingolipid to include an acceptor by methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, to provide a suitable acceptor for a sialyltransferase, a suitable acceptor can be synthesized by using a galactosyltransferase to attach a galactose residue to, for<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> example, a GalNAc or other appropriate saccharide moiety that is linked to the glycosphingoid. In other embodiments, glycosphingoid-linked oligosaccharides can be first "trimmed," either in whole or in part, to expose either an acceptor for the sialyltransferase or a moiety to which one or more appropriate residues can be added to obtain a suitable acceptor. Enzymes such as glycosyltransferases and endoglycosidases are useful for the attaching and trimming reactions.</p> <p num="p0022">The second step in the synthesis of gangliosides involves the addition of a second carbohydrate residue, galactose, to the glucosylsphingoid to form the structure GalŒ≤1-4Glc-R, wherein R is ceramide (and the product is lactosylceramide) or other sphingoid (Step 2).

Use of Organic Solvents</i></b></heading><p num="p0058">In some embodiments, the glycosyltransferase reactions are carried out in the presence of an organic solvent. In presently preferred embodiments, the fatty acid moiety is first hydrolyzed as described above. The enzymatic catalyses can be carried out in the presence of an organic solvent, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, and the like, either singly or in combination. The proportion of the organic solvent in the reaction mixture is typically at least about 3%, more preferably at least about 5%, and most preferably at least about 8%. The reaction mixture typically contains about 25% or less of organic solvent, more preferably about 20% or less, and most preferably about 10% or less organic solvent. In a presently preferred embodiment, the reaction mixture contains about 8-10% methanol.</p><p num="p0059">The use of an organic solvent in the reaction mixture provides several advantages over previously described enzymatic synthesis methods of glycosylceramides. A previously known method for synthesis of the neolacto series ganglioside 6'-nLM, was completed with less than 5% yield based on sialic acid (<nplcit id="ncit0070" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Hasegawa et al.

A subsequently reported method which involved removal of the fatty acid in conjunction with the presence of a detergent in the reaction mixture obtained a yield of only 30-40% (Guadino and Paulson, <i>supra.</i>). The use of an organic solvent as provided by the present invention not only results in a much higher yield than was obtainable previously, it also eliminates the need for a detergent to increase<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> accessibility to the glycosyl moiety of the glycosylceramide. This facilitates purification of the resulting ganglioside. However, detergents can also be used in the methods of the invention.</p><heading><b><i>D. Glycosyltransferase Reaction Conditions</i></b></heading><p num="p0060">The glycosylation steps in the methods of the invention are preferably carried out enzymatically. In a preferred embodiment, a plurality of enzymatic steps are carried out in a single reaction mixture that contains two or more different glycosyltransferases. For example, one can conduct a galactosylating and a sialylating step simultaneously by including both sialyltransferase and galactosyltransferase in the reaction mixture. In this embodiment, the enzymes and substrates can be combined in an initial reaction mixture, or preferably the enzymes and reagents for a second glycosyltransferase cycle can be added to the reaction medium once the first glycosyltransferase cycle has neared completion. By conducting two glycosyltransferase cycles in sequence in a single vessel, overall yields are improved over procedures in which an intermediate species is isolated. Moreover, cleanup and disposal of extra solvents and by-products is reduced.</p><p num="p0061">Enzyme amounts or concentrations are expressed in activity Units, which is a measure of the initial rate of catalysis. One activity Unit catalyzes the formation of 1 ¬µmol of product per minute at a given temperature (typically 37¬∞C) and pH value (typically 7.5). Thus, 10 Units of an enzyme is a catalytic amount of that enzyme where 10 ¬µmols of substrate are converted to 10 ¬µmol of product in one minute at a temperature of 37¬∞C and a pH value of 7.5. The enzymes can be utilized free in solution or can be bound to a support such as a polymer. The reaction mixture is thus substantially homogeneous at the beginning, although some precipitate can form during the reaction.</p><p num="p0062">The glycosylation reactions include, in addition to the appropriate glycosyltransferase and acceptor, an activated nucleotide sugar that acts as a sugar donor for the glycosyltransferase. The reactions can also include other ingredients that facilitate glycosyltransferase activity. These ingredients can include a divalent cation (<i>e.g.</i>, Mg<sup>+2</sup> or Mn<sup>+2</sup>), materials necessary for ATP regeneration, phosphate ions, and organic solvents. The concentrations or amounts of the various reactants used in the processes depend upon numerous factors including reaction conditions such as temperature and pH value, and the choice and amount of acceptor saccharides to be glycosylated. The reaction medium may<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> also comprise solubilizing detergents (<i>e.g.</i>, Triton or SDS) and organic solvents such as methanol or ethanol, if necessary.</p><p num="p0063">In optimized reactions, the above ingredients can be combined by admixture in an aqueous reaction medium (solution) which has a pH value of about 6 to about 8.5. The medium is devoid of chelators that bind enzyme cofactors such as Mg<sup>+2</sup> or Mn<sup>+2</sup>. The selection of a medium is based on the ability of the medium to maintain pH value at the desired level. Thus, in some embodiments, the medium is buffered to a pH value of about 7.5, preferably with HEPES. If a buffer is not used, the pH of the medium should be maintained at about 6 to 8.5, preferably about 7.2 to 7.8, by the addition of base. A suitable base is NaOH, preferably 6 M NaOH.</p><p num="p0064">The temperature at which an above process is carried out can range from just above freezing to the temperature at which the most sensitive enzyme denatures. That temperature range is preferably about zero degrees C to about 110¬∞C, and more preferably at about 20¬∞C to about 30¬∞C, or higher for a thermophilic organism.</p><p num="p0065">The reaction mixture so formed is maintained for a period of time sufficient for the glycosyltransferase(s) to glycosylate a high percentage of the acceptors.

A preferred nucleoside triphosphate is ATP.</p><p num="p0070">Nucleoside monophosphate kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates. Nucleoside monophosphate kinase (NMK) or myokinase (MK; EC 2.7.4.3) used in accordance with the CMP-sialic acid regenerating system of the present invention are used to catalyze the phosphorylation of CMP. NMK's are commercially available (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, Mo; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.).</p><p num="p0071">A phosphate donor and a catalytic amount of a kinase that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from the phosphate donor to an activating nucleotide are also part of the CMP-sialic acid regenerating system. The phosphate donor of the regenerating system is a phosphorylated compound, the phosphate group of which can be used to phosphorylate the nucleoside phosphate. The only limitation on the selection of a phosphate donor is that neither the phosphorylated nor the dephosphorylated forms of the phosphate donor can<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> substantially interfere with any of the reactions involved in the formation of the sialylated galactosyl glycoside. Preferred phosphate donors are phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and acetyl phosphate. A particularly preferred phosphate donor is PEP.</p><p num="p0072">The selection of a particular kinase for use in a sialic acid cycle depends upon the phosphate donor employed. When acetyl phosphate is used as the phosphate donor, the kinase is acetyl kinase. When PEP is used as the phosphate donor, the kinase is pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40). Other kinases can be employed with other phosphate donors as is well known to those of skill in the art. Kinases are commercially available (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, Mo.; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.).</p><p num="p0073">Because of the self-contained and cyclic character of this glycosylation method, once all the reactants and enzymes are present, the reaction continues until the first of the stoichiometric substrates (<i>e.g.</i> free Neu5Ac and PEP) is consumed.</p><p num="p0074">In the sialylation cycle, CMP is converted to CDP by nucleoside monophosphate kinase in the presence of added ATP. ATP is catalytically regenerated from its byproduct, ADP, by pyruvate kinase (PK) in the presence of added phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). CDP is further converted to CTP, which conversion is catalyzed by PK in the presence of PEP. CTP reacts with sialic acid to form inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and CMP-sialic acid, the latter reaction being catalyzed by CMP-sialic acid synthetase. Following sialylation of the galactosyl glycoside, the released CMP re-enters the regenerating system to reform CDP, CTP and CMP-sialic acid. The formed PPi is scavenged as discussed below, and forms inorganic phosphate (Pi) as a byproduct. Pyruvate is also a byproduct.</p><p num="p0075">The byproduct pyruvate can also be made use of in another reaction in which N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and pyruvate are reacted in the presence of NeuAc aldolase (EC 4.1.3.3) to form sialic acid. Thus, the sialic acid can be replaced by ManNAc and a catalytic amount of NeuAc aldolase. Although NeuAc aldolase also catalyzes the reverse reaction (NeuAc to ManNAc and pyruvate), the produced NeuAc is irreversibly incorporated into the reaction cycle via CMP-NeuAc catalyzed by CMP-sialic acid synthetase coupled with inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase)-catalyzed decomposition of the released inorganic pyrophosphate. This enzymatic synthesis of sialic acid and its 9-substituted derivatives and the use of a resulting sialic acid in a different sialylating reaction scheme is disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0012" dnum="WO9216640A" status="new"><text>International application WO 92/16640, published on Oct. 1, 1992</text></patcit>.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></p><p num="p0076">As used herein, the term "pyrophosphate scavenger" refers to substances that serve to remove inorganic pyrophosphate from a reaction mixture of the present invention. Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is a byproduct of the preparation of CMP-Neu5Ac. Produced PPi can feed back to inhibit other enzymes such that glycosylation is reduced. However, PPi can be degraded enzymatically or by physical means such as sequestration by a PPi binding substance. Preferably, PPi is removed by hydrolysis using inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase; EC 3.6.1.1), a commercially available PPi catabolic enzyme (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, Mo.; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.), and that or a similar enzyme serves as the pyrophosphate scavenger. One method of removing PPi or Pi from the reaction mixture is to maintain divalent metal cation concentration in the medium. In particular, the cations and the inorganic phosphate produced form a complex of very low solubility. By supplementing the cations which are lost by precipitation with pyrophosphate, the rate of reaction can be maintained and the reactions can be taken to completion (i.e., 100% conversion). Supplementing can be carried out continuously (<i>e.g.</i>, by automation) or discontinuously. When cation concentration is maintained in this way, the transferase reaction cycle can be driven to completion.</p><p num="p0077">For glycosyltransferase cycles, the concentrations or amounts of the various reactants used in the processes depend upon numerous factors including reaction conditions such as temperature and pH value, and the choice and amount of acceptor saccharides to be glycosylated. Because the glycosylation process permits regeneration of activating nucleotides, activated donor sugars and scavenging of produced PPi in the presence of catalytic amounts of the enzymes, the process is limited by the concentrations or amounts of the stoichiometric substrates discussed before. The upper limit for the concentrations of reactants that can be used in accordance with the method of the present invention is determined by the solubility of such reactants. Preferably, the concentrations of activating nucleotides, phosphate donor, the donor sugar and enzymes are selected such that glycosylation proceeds until the acceptor is consumed, thus completely sialylating the saccharide groups present on the glycoprotein.</p><p num="p0078">In some presently preferred embodiments, the glycosylation reactions are conducted by contacting the acceptor with a cell that contains: a) an enzymatic system for producing a nucleotide sugar, and b) a recombinant glycosyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of a sugar from the nucleotide sugar to the acceptor to produce the desired<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> glycosphingoid. The cells are generally permeabilized and added to the reaction mixture. For reactions that require multiple glycosyltransferase steps, one can use cells that contain more than one recombinant glycosyltransferase and produce the corresponding nucleotide sugar for both glycosyltransferases. Mixtures of cell types that each contain one or more glycosyltransferase can be used, or multiple glycosyltransferase systems can be present in one cell type. Suitable methods are described in, for example, commonly assigned patent applications, each entitled "Low Cost Manufacture Of Oligosaccharides", filed on November 18, 1998 as Attorney Docket No. 14137-013800US and on November 19, 1998 as Attorney Docket No. 14137-013810US.</p><p num="p0079">The products produced by the above processes can be used without purification. However, it is usually preferred to recover the product. To purify glycolipids and gangliosides, standard methods for glycolipid preparation can be used (<i>see, e.g.,</i><nplcit id="ncit0077" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Ledeen et al. (1973) J.

The resulting upper phase of the extraction contains gangliosides and the lower phase contains glycolipids. The upper phase containing gangliosides (glycosphingolipids that contain at least one sialic acid moiety) are isolated and separated into neutral and acidic fractions using DEAE-Sephadex chromatography as described in detail by <nplcit id="ncit0079" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Ledeen and Yu, Methods Enzymol. 83: 139 (1982</text></nplcit>).

These are isolated and separated on preparative thin-layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8) as the solvent system as described by Symington.</p><p num="p0080">Other standard, well known techniques for recovery of glycosylated saccharides are suitable, including such as thin or thick layer chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. A preferred method of purification involves membrane filtration, more preferably utilizing a reverse osmotic membrane, or one or more column chromatographic techniques for the recovery as is discussed hereinafter and in the literature cited herein. For instance, membrane filtration wherein the membranes have molecular weight cutoff of about 3000 to about 10,000 can be used to remove proteins. Nanofiltration or reverse osmosis can then be used to remove salts and/or purify the soluble oligosaccharide<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> products (<i>see, e.g.,</i><patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US08947775B" status="new"><text>US Patent Application No. 08/947,775, filed October 9, 1997</text></patcit>). Nanofilter membranes are a class of reverse osmosis membranes which pass monovalent salts but retain polyvalent salts and uncharged solutes larger than about 100 to about 700 Daltons, depending upon the membrane used.

Following incubation with the labeled antibody, the plate is exposed to radiographic detection film and developed. Black spots on the X-ray film correspond to gangliosides that bind to the monoclonal antibody, and those gangliosides are recovered by scraping the corresponding areas of the silica plate and eluting the gangliosides with chloroform/methanol/water. Glycolipids are also dried and resuspended in chloroform and developed in a similar thin layer system and probed with the radiolabeled antibody.</p><p num="p0082">Other methods by which one can analyze the oligosaccharides produced using the methods of the invention are known to those of skill in the art. For example, the carbohydrate units can be released from the glycosphingoids or glycosylceramides by alkaline Œ≤-elimination, for example, and separated from the ceramide or sphingoid moieties by gel filtration. The resulting oligosaccharides are then separated from each other using a combination of gel filtration, HPLC, thin layer chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography, and can be fully analyzed. Complete structural analysis of the purified oligosaccharide units requires the determination of the monosaccharide units, their ring form, configuration (D or L), anomeric linkage (Œ± or Œ≤), the positions of the linkages between the sugars and their sequence. In addition, the position of any substituent groups are established. Methylation analysis is used to determine the positions of the glycosidic linkages between the monosaccharides.
