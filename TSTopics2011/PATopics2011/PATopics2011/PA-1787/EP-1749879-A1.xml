The clay suspension that is added to the reservoir volume of the Accusizer 780 SPOS is diluted in more distilled water to form a diluted clay suspension; this dilution occurs in the reservoir volume of the Accusizer 780 SPOS and is an automated process that is controlled by the Accusizer 780 SPOS, which determines the optimum concentration of the diluted clay suspension for determining the weight average particle size of the clay particles in the diluted clay suspension. The diluted clay suspension is left in the reservoir volume of the Accusizer 780 SPOS for 3 minutes. The clay suspension is vigorously stirred for the whole period of time that it is in the reservoir volume of the Accusizer 780 SPOS. The diluted clay suspension is then sucked through the sensors of the Accusizer 780 SPOS; this is an automated process that is controlled by the Accusizer 780 SPOS, which determines the optimum flow rate of the diluted clay suspension through the sensors for determining the weight average particle size of the clay particles in the diluted clay suspension.

Sodium carbonate powder is also added simultaneously to the high speed mixer at a rate of 969 kg/h. A premix of 78w/w% aqueous C<sub>11-13</sub> alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) paste and sodium silicate powder, formed by intimately mixing the two components under shear, is dosed into the mixer at a rate of 4239 kg/h, where it is blended into the powders to form wet particles. The wet particles exit the high speed mixer and feed into a low shear mixer (e.g. a KM 4200 Lodige) running at a speed of 80 - 100 rpm. The mixing action and residence time grow the particles into agglomerates with particle size range of 150 - 2000 micrometers. The agglomerates from the low shear mixer enter a fluid bed with an inlet air temperature of 125 -135 degrees centigrade to dry off the excess moisture, before passing into a second fluid bed with an inlet air temperature of 5 - 15 degrees centigrade to cool down the agglomerates. Fines particles of less than 300 micrometer particle size, equivalent to -25% of the total raw material feed rate are elutriated from the fluid beds and recycled back to the high speed mixer. The product from the second fluid bed is then sieved to remove particles greater than 1180 micrometers, which are recycled back to the first fluid bed (dryer) after passing through a grinder. The final agglomerates from the end of the process have a 5 - 6w/w% water content, and a particle size range between 200 - 1400 micrometers. Final particle composition comprises: 40.0wt% C<sub>11-13</sub> alkylbenzene sulphonate detersive surfactant; 37.6wt% zeolite; 0.9wt% sodium silicate; 12.0wt% sodium carbonate; 9.5wt% miscellaneous/water.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 12: A laundry detergent spray dried particle.</u></heading><p num="p0051">A detergent particle is produced by mixing the liquid and solid components of the formulation with water to form a viscous slurry. The slurry is fed under high pressure through nozzles to give atomisation in a spray drying tower, where the atomised droplets encounter a hot air stream. Water is rapidly evaporated from the droplets giving porous granules which are collected at the base of the tower. The granules are then cooled via an airlift, and screened to remove coarse lumps.
