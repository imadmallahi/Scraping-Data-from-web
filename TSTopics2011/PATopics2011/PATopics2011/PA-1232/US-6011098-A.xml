Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relates to a water-based ink with which recording can be made on not only coated paper, but also on non-coated paper generally used in offices and homes, i.e., so-called plain paper, at high printing density and quality. This invention further relates to an ink jet recording method using the ink, as well as equipment using the ink.</p><p>2. Description of the Related Art</p><p>An ink jet recording technique is advantageous in that less noise is generated during recording, and recording images of high resolution are obtained at a high speed by using heads with a high degree of integration. Such an ink jet recording technique employs, as a recording liquid, ink that is prepared by dissolving various water-soluble dyes in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent. However, the use of water-soluble dyes often causes a problem in light resistance of recorded images because the water-soluble dyes are inherently poor in light resistance.</p><p>Owing to the fact that ink is water-soluble, there also occurs a problem in water resistance of recorded images. In other words, if recorded images are moistened with rain, sweat or drinking water, they are likely to blur or disappear.</p><p>Meanwhile, because of similar problems with respect to stationery usages involving such needs as ball pens employing dyes, various types of water pigment inks for stationery have been proposed with a view to solving the problems of resistance against light and water. From the standpoint of using water pigment inks, proposals for achieving dispersion stability, preventing ink from solidifying at ball points, and preventing abrasion of balls used in ball pens are discussed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 58-80368, No. 61-247774, No. 61-272278, No. 62-568, No. 62-101671, No. 62-101672, No. 1-249869, and No. 1-301760. Recently, ball pens, markers and the like using water-based pigment inks have been sold on the market. As ink jet recording ink using water pigment ink, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 56-147859, No. 56-147860, etc. propose ink using a particular water-soluble solvent and a high-molecular dispersant. Further, ink using both a pigment and a dye is proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-57859, No. 4-57860, etc.</p><p>However, conventional water-based pigment ink has a disadvantage in that printing quality and density are remarkably deteriorated depending on the types of paper used, especially when recording is made on plain paper (such as copying paper and bond paper widely used in offices). In general, since the surface condition of plain paper is not uniform, unlike specific paper for ink jet recording, the quality of prints on plain paper varies depending on differences in absorption, spread and other properties of the ink. From the viewpoint particularly of printing density, which affects the quality of prints to a large extent, printing quality is less affected by ink using water-soluble dyes depending on the surface condition of paper as dyes are fixed to paper fibers and tend to easily stay on the paper surface. On the other hand, because water-based pigment ink establishes printing density by leaving pigments on the paper surface, the paper surface condition largely affects the printing density. More specifically, water-based pigment ink employs alkali-soluble resins as a dispersant in most cases so that printing density is increased by agglomeration of the resins on the paper surface. Although printing quality and density are remarkably deteriorated with some types of paper, it is thought that the use of alkali-soluble resins, especially (meth-) acrylic acid copolymers, is effective in not only satisfying printing quality and density, but also providing satisfactory dispersion of pigments and other properties. On the other hand, if those resins are used with ink for ink jet recording, many problems concerning reliability such as discharge stability, dispersion stability for a long term, and solidification of ink left at the fine nozzle end for a long time would be remained unsolved. This means that the use of those resins makes it difficult to achieve the desired printing density and quality and the desired reliability at the same time.</p><p>As means for improving printing density and quality, ink using alkali-soluble resins as a dispersant is disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 56-147863, No. 56-147868, No. 56-157470, No. 60-223074 and No. 60-223075. However, the disclosed types of ink cannot provide satisfactory printing density and quality when used for ink jet recording.</p><p>Accordingly, there has been demand for an ink which can improve printing density and quality while meeting the reliability, required when used for ink jet recording, and particularly, stability in dispersion and discharge.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In view of the above-discussed problems in the prior art, an object of the present invention is to provide a water-based pigment ink with which recording can be made on various kinds of plain paper at a high printing density and quality while ensuring satisfactory reliability.

In other words, water-based pigment ink establishes printing density owing to the fact that discharged ink starts agglomerating immediately after reaching the paper surface and then remains there. If the paper has such a surface condition as to cause the ink to lose stability, good printing density is obtained, but if the ink starts to penetrate before agglomerating, the desired printing density cannot be obtained. While plain paper is mainly classified into acid paper and neutralized paper, any kind of paper can be subjected to various treatments depending on applications, and hence has different surface conditions. This results in difficulties in designing an ink so that the ink begins to instantaneously agglomerate on the paper surfaces under every condition. Further, designing an ink so that it is unstable in a dispersion state, providing desired printing density, as described above, is contradictory to the reliability required for ink jet recording ink, i.e., discharge stability, stability during storage for a long term, and prevention of solidification of ink left for a long time at the fine nozzle end (orifice).</p><p>With attention focused on a dispersant for use with water-based pigment inks, the inventors have found that, by using at least one polymer selected from the above groups (a) to (c) as a dispersant, desired printing density and quality can be obtained simultaneously with achievement of satisfactory reliability required for ink jet recording ink, i.e., discharge stability, stability during storage for a long term, and prevention of ink left for a long time from solidifying at the fine nozzle end of an ink jet recording apparatus.</p><p>The inventors have also found that printing density and discharge characteristics are improved by using a combination of pigments and white inorganic fine particles, and a specific solvent, or by using rosin-denaturated maleic acid, as a dispersant, and a particular solvent in combination.</p><p>The present invention will hereinafter be described in detail.</p><p>The water-soluble resin selected from the above group (a) and used as a dispersant in the present invention contains 3 to 25 mol % of at least one monomer containing a long-chain nonionic group, which is selected from the above three types of compounds having the general structures represented by the formulae (I) to (III). Examples of such a monomer include:</p><p>as for the formula (I), CH.sub.2 ═C(R)--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.m H (m=2 to 24);</p><p>CH.sub.2 ═C(CH.sub.3)--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.m H: Blenmer-PE-90 (m=1.9, Nippon Oil &amp; Fats, Co.,),</p><p>CH.sub.2 ═C(CH.sub.3)--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.m H: Blenmer-PE-200 (m=4.4, Nippon Oil &amp; Fats, Co.,),</p><p>CH.sub.2 ═C(CH.sub.3)--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.m H: Blenmer-PE-350 (m=7.7, Nippon Oil &amp; Fats, Co.,), and</p><p>CH.sub.2 ═CH--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.m H (m=24): on experimental basis;</p><p>as for the formula (II), CH.sub.2 ═C(R)--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.n --(CH.sub.2).sub.l H (n=2 to 24, l=1 to 12);</p><p>methoxytriethylene glycol acrylate (R═H, n=3, l=1): NK ester AM-30G,</p><p>methoxypolyethylene glycol #400 acrylate (R═H, n=approximately 10, l=1): NK ester AM-90G,</p><p>methoxydiethylene glycol methacrylate (R═CH.sub.3, n=2, l=1): NK ester M-20G,</p><p>methoxytetraethylene glycol methacrylate (R═CH.sub.3, n=4, l=1): NK ester M-40G,</p><p>methoxypolyethylene glycol #400 methacrylate (R═CH.sub.3, n=approximately 10, l=1): NK ester M-90G,</p><p>methoxypolyethylene glycol #1000 methacrylate (R═H, n=3, l=1): NK ester AM-230G, and</p><p>buthoxydiethylene glycol acrylate (R═H, n=2, l=4): NK ester AB-20G (all these products being manufactured by Shin Nakamura Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.); and</p><p>as for the formula (III), CH.sub.2 ═C(R)--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.p -phenyl-(CH.sub.2).sub.q H (p=1 to 12, q=0 to 16);</p><p>phenoxydiethylene glycol acrylate (R═H, p=2, q=0): NK ester AMP-20G,</p><p>phenoxypolyethylene glycol acrylate (R═H, p=approximately 5, q=0): NK ester AMP-60G,</p><p>nonylphenoxyethyl acrylate (R═H, p=1, q=8): NK ester NPA-10G (all these products being manufactured by Shin Nakamura Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), and</p><p>CH.sub.2 ═CH--COO--(CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O).sub.10 -phenyl-(CH.sub.2).sub.16 H: on experimental basis.</p><p>Further, it is essential for the present ink to contain, as a hydrophilic monomer, 5 to 60 mol % of α, β-ethylenic unsaturated carboxylic acid. Examples of such a monomer include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid, etc. Derivatives of these acids may also be used.</p><p>Examples of a hydrophobic monomer for use in copolymerization of the dispersant in the present invention include styrenes such as styrene, α-methylstyrene and vinyltoluene, and (meth-)acryl acid alkyl esters. The (meth-)acryl acid alkyl esters includes methyl (meth-)acrylate, ethyl (meth-)acrylate, propyl (meth-)acrylate, isopropyl (meth-)acrylate, n-butyl (meth-)acrylate, sec-butyl (meth-)acrylate, tert-butyl (meth-)acrylate, 2-methylbutyl (meth-)acrylate, 2-ethylbutyl (meth-)acrylate, 3-methylbutyl (meth-)acrylate, 1,3-dimethylbutyl (meth-)acrylate, pentyl (meth-)acrylate, 3-pentyl (meth-)acrylate, hexyl (meth-)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth-)acrylate, heptyl (meth-)acrylate, octyl (meth-)acrylate, nonyl (meth-)acrylate, 2-ethoxyethyl acrylate, 3-ethoxylpropyl acrylate, 2-ethoxybutyl acrylate, 3-ethoxybutyl acrylate, and dimethylaminoethyl acrylate. An alcohol ingredient for use in half-esterification includes methanol, ethanol, and propanol.</p><p>Polymerization of the dispersant in the present invention using such monomers can readily be performed by radical copolymerization.</p><p>The weight-average molecular weight of the polymer is preferably in the range of 500 to 30000, more preferably 1000 to 15000.</p><p>Further, the content of the polymer is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5 wt % with respect to the total ink weight.</p><p>It has been confirmed that the use of the polymer described above is highly effective in not only improving printing density and quality due to an agglomerating effect provided by the α, β-ethylenic unsaturated carboxylic acid, but also in ensuring discharge stability, stability during storage for a long term, and prevention of ink left for a long time from solidifying at the fine nozzle end which are required for ink jet recording ink, due to an effect of the long-chain nonionic group containing monomer, i.e., an improvement in solubility and pH-stability. Additionally, it has also been confirmed that mixing the long-chain nonionic group containing monomer in the dispersant is also effective in improving printing density and quality.</p><p>The water-soluble resin selected from the above group (b) and used as a dispersant in the present invention contains in a copolymer, a monomer having a hydrophobic part, 5 to 70 mol % of at least one monomer having the general structure represented by the formula (IV) or (V). Practically, examples of such a monomer include vinyl acetate, isopropenyl acetate, allyl acetate, allyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, allyl butyrate, etc.</p><p>Other hydrophobic monomers for use in copolymerization include styrene, styrene derivatives, vinylnaphthalene, vinylnaphthalene derivatives, etc.</p><p>Examples of a hydrophilic monomer for use in copolymerization include acrylic acid, acrylic acid derivatives, maleic acid, maleic acid derivatives, itaconic acid, itaconic acid derivatives, fumaric acid, fumaric acid derivatives, etc.</p><p>Polymerization of the dispersant in the present invention using such monomers can readily be performed by radical copolymerization.</p><p>The weight-average molecular weight of the polymer is preferably in the range of 500 to 30000, more preferably 1000 to 15000.</p><p>Further, the content of the copolymer is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5 wt % with respect to the total ink weight.</p><p>The water-soluble resin given by the above group (c) and used as a dispersant in the ink of the present invention is polyethyleneimine. This polymer is not a completely linear high molecular weight molecule, but has branched parts to some extent and includes primary, secondary and tertiary amino nitrogen. Properly anion- or cation-denaturated polyethyleneimine can also satisfactorily be used. Practical examples include Epomin series manufactured by Nippon Shokubai Co., Ltd. The weight-average molecular weight of the polymer is preferably in the range of 1000 to 40000. Further, the content of the polymer is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 10 wt % with respect to the total ink weight.</p><p>Since polyethyleneimine itself has higher pH-stability and resolubility than alkali-soluble resins conventionally used as a dispersant, its use is thought to be very effective in ensuring discharge stability, stability during storage for a long term, and prevention of ink left for a long time from solidifying at the fine nozzle end, which are required for ink jet recording ink. Conversely, it is generally inferred that the use of polyethyleneimine having such properties deteriorates printing density and quality, as described above. The satisfactory printing density and quality resulted herein are presumably based on the fact that polyethyleneimine itself has high affinity with the paper component, but the genuine reason is not yet clear.</p><p>Further, the inventors have found that wiping resistance of prints is improved in the case of using polyethyleneimine.</p><p>The content of pigment in the ink of the present invention, which contains at least one polymer selected from the above groups (a) to (c), is preferably in the range of 1 to 20 wt %, more preferably 2 to 12 wt %., for the total ink weight. So long as the above condition is satisfied, any desired pigment can be used in the present invention. As carbon black for use in black ink, there can be used one which is manufactured by the furnace method or the channel method, and has the primary particle size of 15 to 40 nm, a specific surface area of 50 to 300 m.sup.2 /g according to the BET method, a DBP oil absorption amount of 40 to 150 ml/100 g, a volatile ingredient of 0.5 to 10% , and a pH value of 2 to 9, e.g., such as, for example, commercially available carbon black NO. 2300, NO. 900, MCF88, NO. 33, NO. 40, NO. 45, NO. 52, MA7, MA8 and NO. 2200B (by Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.), RAVEN 1255 (by Columbia Co.), MOGUL L (by Cabot Co.), and Color Black FW1, Color Black FW18, Color Black S170, Color Black S150 and Printex U (by Degussa, AG). Other carbon black newly manufactured for the present invention can also be used. Examples of a pigment for use in yellow ink include C.I. Pigment Yellow 1, C.I. Pigment Yellow 2, C.I. Pigment Yellow 3, C.I. Pigment Yellow 13, C.I. Pigment Yellow 16, and C.I. Pigment Yellow 83. Examples of a pigment for use in magenta ink include C.I. Pigment Red 5, C.I. Pigment Red 7, C.I. Pigment Red 12, C.I. Pigment Red 48(Ca), C.I. Pigment Red 48(Mn), C.I. Pigment Red 57(Ca), C.I. Pigment Red 112, and C.I. Pigment Red 122. Examples of a pigment for use in cyan ink include C.I. Pigment Blue 1, C.I. Pigment Blue 2, C.I. Pigment Blue 3, C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3, C.I. Pigment Blue 16, C.I. Pigment Blue 22, C.I. Vat Blue 4, and C.I. Vat Blue 6. In addition, other pigments newly manufactured for the present invention can also be used.</p><p>Moreover, the ink of the present invention is preferably prepared to be neutral or alkaline as a whole for the purpose of improving solubility of the above-described water-soluble resin and ensuring higher stability during storage for a long term. In this connection, however, since various members used in the ink jet recording apparatus may be apt to corrode, the pH range is preferably held in the range of 7 to 10.</p><p>Examples of a pH adjuster include various organic amines such as diethanolamine and triethanolamine, inorganic alkaline agents such as hydroxides of alkaline metals including sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc., organic acids, and mineral acids.</p><p>The above-described pigment and water-soluble resin are dispersed or dissolved in a water-based medium.</p><p>A water-based medium suitable for the ink of the present invention is a mixture of water and a water-soluble solvent. Preferably used as the water is not usual water containing various ions, but ion-exchanged water (deionized water).</p><p>As other optional solvent ingredient which can be used in combination with the above-described ingredients, a water-soluble organic solvent to be mixed to water includes, for example, alkyl alcohols with 1 to 4 carbons such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, sec-butyl alcohol, and tert-butyl alcohol; amides such as dimethyl formamide and dimethyl acetoamide; ketones or ketone alcohols such as acetone and diacetone alcohol; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol; alkylene glycols with alkylene groups each containing 2 to 6 carbons, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1, 2, 6-hexanetriol, thiodiglycol, hexylene glycol, and diethylene glycol; glycerin; lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, such as monomethyl(or ethyl) ether of ethylene glycol, methyl(or ethyl) ether of diethylene glycol, and monomethyl (or ethyl) ether of triethylene glycol ; N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone. Of these many water-soluble organic solvents, polyhydric alcohols such as diethylene glycol and lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, such as monomethyl(or ethyl) ether of triethylene glycol, are preferable.</p><p>To provide discharge stability, it is effective to add ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, or lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols. It is believed that air bubbles can more steadily be generated in the ink over a thin-film resistor by addition of such a solvent.</p><p>A water-soluble solvent especially preferably combined with the dispersant (a) includes monoalkyl ether of diol and/or monoalkyl ether of triol and/or dialkyl ether of triol (with an alkyl group having 4 or more carbons). Among them, monobutyl ether of diethylene glycol, monobutyl ether of ethylene glycol, monobutyl ether of triethylene glycol, monopentyl ether of glycerin, dihexyl ether of 1,2,6-hexanetriol, diethyl ether of 1,2,4-butanetriol, etc. The content of monoalkyl ether of diol and/or monoalkyl ether of triol and/or dialkyl ether of triol (with an alkyl group having 4 or more carbons) is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 5 wt % for the total ink weight from the standpoint of improving printing density, printing quality and deposit of the ink.</p><p>The content of the water-soluble organic solvent in the ink of the present invention is usually in the range of 3 to 50 wt %, preferably 3 to 40 wt %, for the total ink weight. The content of the water used is in the range of 10 to 90 wt %, preferably 30 to 80 wt %, for the total ink weight.</p><p>In order for the ink to have further desired physical properties, a surfactant, a bubble retarder, an antiseptic, etc. can be added to the ink of the present invention, if necessary, in addition to the above-described ingredients. Commercially available water-soluble dyes can also be added.</p><p>So long as stability during storage and other required properties of the ink will not adversely be affected, no limitations exist on the kind of surfactant used. There are, e.g., anionic surfactants such as fatty acid salts, ester sulfates of higher alcohols, ester sulfates of liquid fatty oil, and alkylallyl sulfonates; and nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylenesorbitane alkyl esters, acetylene alcohol, and acetylene glycol. One or two surfactants properly selected from the above examples can be used. Depending on the kind of dispersant, the amount of surfactant(s) used is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 5 wt % for the total ink weight. In this connection, the surfactant content is preferably selected so that the ink has a surface tension not less than 30 dyne/cm. The reason is that if the surface tension of the ink is less than the above value, problems trouble such as printing deviation (i.e., shift in arrival point of the ink droplet) would be caused due to wetting at the nozzle end in the ink jet recording intended by the present invention.</p><p>A second aspect of the present invention resides in water-based ink containing a pigment, a dispersant, a water-soluble organic solvent, and water, wherein the ink contains at least one water-soluble organic solvent selected from the group consisting of monoalkyl ether of diol, monoalkyl ether of triol and dialkyl ether of triol, and white inorganic fine particles.</p><p>The white inorganic particles for use with the second aspect of the present invention are preferably titanium dioxide fine particles or alumina fine particles, but are not limited thereto. Any other fine particles may also be used so long as they can stably disperse together with the pigment used as a color material in the ink jet recording ink. While no special limitations exist on the particle shape, spherical particles are preferably used. Further, these particles may be surface-treated to become hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Among them, titanium dioxide particles whose surfaces are treated to be hydrophilic are especially preferable. These types of particles are on the market as, for example, the Titania series from Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. Other types of titanium dioxide fine particles or alumina fine particles are on the market as, e.g., Titanium Dioxide P25 and Aluminum Oxide C from Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.</p><p>The ratio of primary particle size of the white inorganic fine particles contained in the ink to primary particle size of the pigment contained together as a color material is preferably in the range of 1/10 to 5/1. If the ratio is out of that range, it would be hard to achieve the optimum effect of the present invention, particularly with respect to a satisfactory result in printing quality and density. Considering the particle size of the pigment for use in the ink jet recording ink, the primary particle size of the white inorganic fine particles is in the range of 5 to 200 nm, but the range of 5 to 100 nm is preferable for sufficiently fulfilling the objects of the present invention. The content ratio in weight of the white inorganic fine particles to the pigment used together as a color material is preferably in the range of 1/20 to 1/1. If the content ratio in weight is less than 1/20, it would be hard to achieve the optimum good result in printing quality and density. If the content ratio in weight is larger than 1/1, it would be hard to achieve the optimum good result in reliability such as discharge stability and stability during storage. The range of 1/10 to 1/2 is more preferable for optimally fulfilling the objects of the present invention.</p><p>While any type of water-soluble resin can be used as a dispersant for the pigment, as a color material, and white inorganic fine particles for use with the second aspect of the present invention, its weight-average molecular weight is preferably in the range of 500 to 30000, more preferably 1000 to 15000. Practical examples of the water-soluble resin include block copolymers or random copolymers, or salts thereof, these copolymers each consisting of two or more monomers selected from styrene, styrene derivatives, vinylnaphthalene, vinylnaphthalene derivatives, aliphatic alcohol esters of α, β-ethylenic unsaturated carboxylic acid, acrylic acid, acrylic acid derivatives, maleic acid, maleic acid derivatives, itaconic acid, itaconic acid derivatives, fumaric acid, fumaric acid derivatives, etc. These resins are particularly preferably used in ink jet recording ink, because they are alkali-soluble resins which are soluble in an aqueous solution containing a base dissolved therein and hence have advantages of enabling lower viscosity of the disperse solution and easier dispersion. Alternatively, a homopolymer of a hydrophilic monomer or salt thereof may be used. Other water-soluble resins such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, and a condensation product of naphthalene sulfonate-formaldehyde, and natural resins such as rosin and shellac can also be used. In addition, various surfactants such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers and polyoxyethylene alkyl esters may be used. The content of the water-soluble resin and the surfactant is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5 wt % for the total ink weight. The above-described pigment, white inorganic fine particles and water-soluble resin are dispersed or dissolved in the water-based medium.</p><p>A third aspect of the present invention resides in a water-based ink containing a pigment, a dispersant, a water-soluble organic solvent, and water, wherein the ink contains, as the water-soluble organic solvent, at least one selected from the group consisting of monoalkyl ether of diol, monoalkyl ether of triol and dialkyl ether of triol, and as the dispersant, rosin-denaturated maleic acid.</p><p>The rosin-denaturated maleic acid for use with the third aspect of the present invention has no limitations on the kind thereof, and its commercially available products include Malkyd No. 31 and Malkyd No. 32 (by Arakawa Chemicals Co., Ltd.), Hiparac C and Hiparac PR (by Nippon Shellac Co., Ltd.), Harimac 145P and Harimac R-120AH (by Harima Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), etc. While any type water-soluble resin can be used as a dispersant in combination with the above ingredients in the present invention, its weight-average molecular weight is preferably in the range of 500 to 30000, more preferably 1000 to 15000. Practical examples of the water-soluble resin include block copolymers or random copolymers, or salts thereof, these copolymers each consisting of two or more monomers selected from styrene, styrene derivatives, vinylnaphthalene, vinylnaphthalene derivatives, aliphatic alcohol esters of α, β-ethylenic unsaturated carboxylic acid, acrylic acid, acrylic acid derivatives, maleic acid, maleic acid derivatives, itaconic acid, itaconic acid derivatives, fumaric acid, fumaric acid derivatives, etc. These resins are particularly preferably used in ink jet recording ink, because they are alkali-soluble resins which are soluble in an aqueous solution containing a base dissolved therein and hence have advantages of enabling lower viscosity of the disperse solution and easier dispersion. Alternatively, a homopolymer of a hydrophilic monomer or salt thereof may be used. Other water-soluble resins such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, and a condensation product of naphthalene sulfonate-formaldehyde, and natural resins, e.g., shellac can also be used. In addition, various surfactants such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers and polyoxyethylene alkyl esters may be used. The content of the water-soluble resin and the surfactant is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5 wt % for the total ink weight.</p><p>The ink according to any of the aspects of the present invention described above is prepared by adding a pigment to an aqueous solution containing at least a dispersion resin and water, agitating and then dispersing the mixed solution by using dispersion means (described later), and carrying out a process of centrifugal separation, if necessary, thereby obtaining a desired disperse solution. After that, the other ingredients described above are added to the disperse solution and agitated to produce the ink.</p><p>Before the solution containing the pigment is subjected to the dispersion process, it is also required to carry out pre-mixing for 30 minutes or more. This pre-mixing operation serves to improve wetting of the pigment surface and to promote adsorption onto the pigment surface.</p><p>Bases to be added to the disperse solution in the case of using an alkali-soluble resin are preferably organic amines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, amine methylpropanol and ammonia, or inorganic bases such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide.</p><p>On the other hand, any types of dispersers which are usually employed can be used in the present invention, and include, e.g., a ball mill, a roll mill and a sand mill.</p><p>Among them, a high-speed sand mill is preferable and is commercially available as, e.g., Super Mill, Sand Grinder, Beads Mill, Agitator Mill, Grain Mill, Dyno Mill, Pearl Mill and Cobol Mill (all trade names).</p><p>For obtaining a disperse system of the pigment having the desired grain size distribution, the present invention employs a method of reducing the size of pulverizing media in a disperser, increasing the loading rate of the pulverizing media, prolonging the process time, slowing the discharge speed, or sorting the resultant grains through a filter or centrifugal separator after the pulverization. Any combinations of those methods can also be used.</p><p>A recording apparatus suitable to make recording with the ink of the present invention is arranged such that the ink in a chamber defined within a recording head is supplied with thermal energy corresponding to a recording signal, and an ink droplet is produced by the supplied energy.</p><p>One example of the structure of the head, as a primary part, is shown in FIGS. 1(a), 1(b) and 2. A head 13 is constructed by bonding a glass, ceramic or plastic plate having a channel 14 through which ink is passed, and a heat generating head 15 for use in heat-sensitive recording (the figure showing a thin film head only by way of example) with each other. The heat generating head 15 comprises a protective film 16 formed of, e.g., silicon oxide, aluminum electrodes 17-1, 17-2, a heat-generating resistance material layer 18 formed of, e.g., Nichrome, a heat accumulating layer 19, and a base plate 20 formed of, e.g., alumina and having a high heat radiating ability.</p><p>Ink 21 is filled to reach a discharge orifice (fine hole) 22 and forms a meniscus 23 under a pressure P.</p><p>When an electric signal is applied to the electrodes 17-1 and 17-2 , a region of the heat generating head 15 indicated by n abruptly generates heat so that an air bubble is produced in the ink 21 contacting the region n. The meniscus 23 is projected forwardly with a resultant pressure, causing the ink 21 to discharge and fly in the form of recording droplets 24 from the orifice 22 toward a material 25 on which recording is to be made. FIG. 2 shows an appearance of a multi-head comprising a number of heads, shown in FIG. 1(a), arranged side by side. The multi-head is constructed by bonding a glass plate 27 formed with multiple channels 26 and a heat generating head 28 similar to that described above by referring to FIG. 1(a) with each other.</p><p>Incidentally, FIG. 1(a) is a sectional view of the head taken along an ink flow passage, and FIG. 1(b) is a sectional view taken along line 1(b)-1(b) in FIG. 1(a).</p><p>FIG. 3 shows one example of an ink jet recording apparatus in which the above-described head is incorporated. In FIG. 3, denoted by 61 is a blade as a wiping member in the form of a cantilever, of which one end is held by a blade holding member to become a fixed end. The blade 61 is disposed at a position adjacent a recording area covered by the recording head and, in the illustrated embodiment, it is held in such a manner as to project into the travel path of the recording head. 62 is a cap which is disposed at its home position adjacent the blade 61 and is movable in a direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the recording head such that it comes into contact with the ink discharge surface for capping the same. 63 is an ink absorber which is disposed adjacent the blade 61 and is held in such a manner as to project into the travel path of the recording head similarly to the blade 61. The blade 61, the cap 62 and the absorber 63 cooperatively construct a discharge recovery unit 64 in which the blade 61 and the absorber 63 serve to remove moisture, dust, dirt, etc. on the ink discharge surface. 65 is a recording head which includes discharge energy generating means and discharges ink onto a material, on which recording is to be made and which is disposed facing the ink discharge surface including discharge ports arrayed therein, for thereby recording an image. 66 is a carriage on which the recording head 65 is mounted to be reciprocally moved. The carriage 66 is slidably engaged with a guide shaft 67 and is also connected (though not shown) at its part to a belt 69 driven by a motor 68. With such an arrangement, the carriage 66 is movable along the guide shaft 67 so that the recording head 65 can move over the recording area and an area adjacent thereto.</p><p>Denoted by 51 is a paper feeding portion through which the recording material is inserted, and 52 is a paper feeding roller driven by a motor (not shown). With such an arrangement, the recording material is fed to a position facing the ink discharge surface of the recording head, and is then guided to a paper discharging portion including paper discharging rolls 53 with the progress of recording.</p><p>In the above arrangement, when the recording head 65 is returned to the home position upon the end of recording or other reason, the cap 62 of the head recovery unit 64 is retracted from the travel path of the recording head 65, but the blade 61 is held projected into the travel path. As a result, the ink discharge surface of the recording head 65 is wiped by the recording head 65. When the cap 62 is brought into contact with the ink discharge surface of the recording head 65 for capping the same, it is moved to project into the travel path of the recording head.</p><p>When the recording head 65 is moved from the home position to the recording start position, the cap 62 and the blade 61 are in the same positions as those during the above wiping. In that movement, therefore, the ink discharge surface of the recording head 65 is similarly wiped.</p><p>The movement of the recording head to the home position adjacent the recording area is performed not only upon the end of recording or the recovery of discharge, but also at predetermined intervals during the time in which the recording head is reciprocally moved over the recording area for recording an image. For each of such movements, the wiping of the ink discharge surface of the recording head is made.</p><p>FIG. 4 shows one example of an ink cartridge 45 containing ink supplied to the head through an ink supply tube. In FIG. 4, 40 is an ink bag which contains the ink to be supplied and has a rubber-made plug 42 provided at it distal end. By inserting a needle (not shown) through the plug 42, the ink in the ink bag 40 can be supplied to the head. 44 is an ink absorber for accommodating waste ink.</p><p>The ink jet recording apparatus for use in the present invention is not limited to the above-described construction in which the head and the ink cartridge are separate from each other, and can also suitably be applied to the construction in which both the members are integral with each other as shown in FIG. 5.</p><p>Referring to FIG. 5, 70 is an ink jet cartridge in which an ink absorber impregnated with ink is housed. The ink existing in the ink absorber is discharged in the form of ink droplets through a head portion 71 having a plurality of orifices. 72 is an atmosphere communicating port via which the interior of the cartridge is communicated with the atmosphere.</p><p>The ink jet cartridge 70 is used in place of the recording head 65 shown in FIG. 3 and is detachably attached to the carriage 66.</p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>Examples Using a Polymer Selected from the Group (a) as Dispersant</p><heading>Example 1</heading><heading>Polymerization Example 1</heading><p>50 mol % of styrene, 35 mol % of acrylic acid, and 15 mol % of Blemmer-PE-200 were each put in a mixed solvent of ethylene glycol-monomethyl ether and isopropyl alcohol, and then subjected to solution polymerization in accordance with the ordinary process.
