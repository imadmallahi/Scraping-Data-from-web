The blocky chlorinated polyolefins facilitate the dispersion of the elastomers as a dispersed phase with the proper size for impact modification of the PVC and/or CPVC. The blocky chlorinated polyolefin provides better adhesion between the elastomer and the PVC and/or CPVC providing better physical properties such as impact strength as measured by Notched Izod and variable height impact testing (VHIT) than did the randomly chlorinated polyolefins, often used as processing aids and as impact modifiers in PVC or CPVC. The differences in properties achieved with blocky chlorinated polyolefins versus randomly chlorinated polyolefins are attributed to the individual blocks of the blocky polyolefin being compatible (and/or co-crystalizable) with either the polyolefin elastomer or the PVC/CPVC resulting in better adhesion between phases.</p></abstract><description lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><?description-type Brief Summary?><heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading><p>Post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) and/or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can use a blocky chlorinated polyolefin to compatibilize them (PVC or CPVC) with a polyolefin rubber. The blend of PVC and/or CPVC with the blocky chlorinated polyethylene and polyolefin rubber (elastomer) can have a combination of good impact resistance, high heat distortion temperature (relative to the base CPVC or PVC), good tensile properties, oxidation resistance, and stability to ultraviolet light (UV) exposure. A process is disclosed for block chlorinating polyolefins (e.g. polyethylene) without appreciably swelling the polyolefin or melting the crystalline phase. The process produces a polymeric product having both high chlorine content blocks (e.g. up to 50-75 wt. % chlorine) and relatively non-chlorinated crystallizable polyolefin blocks. The resulting polymer is characterized as blocky. Said crystallizable polyolefin blocks are generally part of the same polymer that is chlorinated. The two different blocks can compatibilize a CPVC or PVC with a polyolefin rubber.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading><p>Polyolefins have been chlorinated in the past. Randomly chlorinated polyethylenes (e.g. Tyrin™ from Dow Chemical) have been used in PVC or CPVC blends, generally as a processing aid and impact modifier. The chlorinated polyethylenes used in PVC or CPVC blends have been randomly (relatively homogeneously) chlorinated by using a swelling solvent and/or a chlorinating temperature above the crystalline melting temperature of the polyethylene. Traditionally those who chlorinated polyethylene wanted to eliminate the crystalline polyethylene phase by chlorinating the crystallizable polyethylene segments, which inhibits or prevents further crystallization of the polyolefin. Residual crystalline fractions in a chlorinated polyethylene would require a processing temperature above the melting point while amorphous polyethylene fractions can be processed at a lower temperature. The use of higher chlorination temperatures and swelling solvents (which decrease residual crystallinity) also increase the rate of the chlorinating reaction, thus reducing costs. It has even been postulated that highly crystalline polyethylene would not be effectively chlorinated unless either it was heated above the crystalline melting temperature or the crystallinity was reduced by using a swelling solvent.</p><p>Two articles were published in Polymer Engineering and Science, vol. 28 pp. 1167-1172 and 1173-1181, which tried to compare and contrast homogeneously chlorinated polyethylene and their blocky chlorinated polyethylene. The chlorination time for the blocky chlorinated polyethylene was continued through 20 hours. The authors postulated that during chlorination the crystalline polyethylene surfaces were chlorinated, converting them to amorphous chlorinated material. They observed that the melting point of the crystalline polyethylene was a function of crystalline thickness and the heat of melting (.increment.H) of the polyethylene decreased after about 20 wt. % chlorine was added. The crystalline thickness was limited after chlorination by the number of successive non-chlorinated methylene repeat units.</p><p>Various conventional impact modifiers have been used with PVC and CPVC such as ABS or MBS impact modifiers. Use of these impact modifiers can reduce other desirable properties of the PVC or CPVC such as heat distortion temperature, thermal stability, oxidation resistance, tensile strength and stability to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. There have been neither publications nor commercial products (except for graft copolymers) that disclose or include polymers prepared by polymerizing blocks of two different monomers to use to compatibilize PVC or CPVC with polyolefins. There is a continuing need for a copolymer to improve the interaction of PVC and/or CPVC with polyolefin elastomers.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p>Chlorinated polyolefins (e.g. polyethylenes) can be prepared having from about 10 or 20 to about 60 wt. % bound chlorine based on the weight of the chlorinated polyolefin (e.g. polyethylene) and having from about 20 to about 99 wt. % residual crystallizable polyolefin (e.g. polyethylene) blocks and having a peak melting temperature from about 110 to about 140 expressed as a percentage based on the weight of crystallizable polyolefin in the polymer before chlorination. Such chlorinated polyolefins (e.g. polyethylenes) can be prepared by a chlorination process from semi-crystalline polyolefin which comprises reacting the semi-crystalline polyolefin in a generally unswollen state at a temperature below its crystalline melting temperature with chlorine for a short period of time. Depending on the reaction conditions chosen (mostly time, chlorine pressure, and temperature), a free radical source, a catalyst, and/or UV radiation may be useful. When the reaction conditions are suitable for quick chlorination, then the amorphous portion of the polyolefin is highly chlorinated while the crystalline portion of the polyolefin is not significantly converted to amorphous chlorinated polyolefin.</p><p>Interfacial agents such as the blocky chlorinated polyethylene can improve the dispersibility of polyolefin elastomers in PVC and/or CPVC and improve the adhesion between the polyolefin elastomer phase and the PVC and/or CPVC. While applicants disclose a preferred method for preparing blocky chlorinated polyethylenes, it is anticipated that any blocky chlorinated polyolefin with significant residual crystallinity and with at least 10 wt. % bound chlorine will have some desirable compatibilizing of PVC and/or CPVC with polyolefin rubbers. The crystalline polyolefin blocks of the chlorinated polyolefin associate with and maybe even co-crystallize, as shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), with segments from the polyolefin rubber while the amorphous chlorinated blocks of said chlorinated polyolefin associate with the PVC and/or CPVC.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 illustrates the residual crystallinity of chlorinated polyethylenes by two different chlorination methods with additional data from a TCE solvent method taken from a journal article. Curve A is by the method of this disclosure, curve B is data from the journal, and curve C is the applicants' attempt to reproduce the method of the journal article.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Blocky chlorinated polyolefins can be used to compatibilize polyolefin elastomers with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and/or chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC). The purpose of compatibilizing a polyolefin elastomer with PVC or CPVC is to form a dispersed polyolefin elastomer phase in the PVC or CPVC which can impart impact modification (act as impact modifier) to the PVC or CPVC resin without unduly detracting from thermal stability, modulus, tensile strength, heat distortion temperature, weatherability and chemical resistance of the compounded PVC or CPVC resin. Preferred compatibilizers will also improve adhesion between phases (a deficiency of randomly chlorinated polyolefins). The resulting PVC or CPVC compound can be used for generally any application (e.g. vinyl siding, sheathing, tubing or pipe, molded articles, etc.). The simple polyolefin elastomers have little detrimental effect on the physical properties of the PVC or CPVC and can greatly enhance the impact strength when the correct compatibilizer or compatibilizers are present in the proper amount and properly blended into PVC or CPVC. Some important characteristics are the size of the dispersed polyolefin elastomer phase and the interfacial adhesion of the polyolefin elastomer phase to the PVC and/or CPVC.</p><p>Typically, blends of immiscible polymers exhibit a coarse and unstable phase morphology with poor interfacial strength. The resulting poor mechanical properties can be improved with a small amount of an interfacial agent. The compatibilizing agent may be a graft or block copolymer added as a third polymeric component. Such agent can reduce the size of the dispersed phase, stabilize the phase morphology against coalescence and increase interfacial adhesion between the dispersed and continuous phases. There are two current interfacial models. The core-shell model wherein the block or graft copolymer absorbs mainly onto the phases in an interfacial layer; and the interpenetration model wherein each sequence of the copolymer penetrates its homopolymer phase and provides effective entanglements and/or co-crystallization. The particular mechanism by which an individual compatibilizing agent functions, depends upon the molecular architecture of the compatibilizing agent (i.e. compatibilizer molecule), especially its arrangement and the chemical composition of the blocks or segments that are miscible, or at least compatible, with each phase.</p><p>It is anticipated that block chlorinated polyolefins can function as compatibilizers for polar chlorine-containing polymers and non-polar polyolefin elastomers by either mechanism. Important to which mechanism predominates and the effectiveness of the compatibilizing agent are the chlorine content of the chlorinated block, the amount of residual polyethylene crystallinity and the length of the methylene sequences in the polyolefin elastomer. Some blocky chlorinated polyethylenes of this disclosure with high residual polyethylene crystallinity can co-crystallize with segments from the polyolefin elastomer (interpenetration model) based on interpretation of the DSC data. Other blocky chlorinated polyolefins mainly absorb onto the phases in an interfacial layer (core-shell model) based on interpretation of transmission electron micrographs (TEM).</p><p>The compatibilizers are prepared by a chlorinating process at low temperatures such that a substantial portion of the crystalline polyolefin (e.g. polyethylene) is still crystalline and less effectively chlorinated than the amorphous portion of the polyolefin. This results in a blocky polymer as each polymer chain usually has both crystalline and amorphous portions. When the crystalline regions are melted and blended with PVC or CPVC they have been found to recrystallize in the PVC or CPVC compositions and form a dispersed phase, which is compatible with and often is co-crystallizable with the polyolefin rubber which often has crystallizable polyethylene or polypropylene segments.</p><p>The semi-crystalline polyolefin precursor to the chlorinated polyolefin has desirably at least 20 or 30 wt. %, more desirably at least 45 wt. % and preferably at least 50 wt. % crystalline polyolefin portions. Unless otherwise defined later wt. % crystallinity will be measured by DSC on as prepared samples of the polyolefin using a heating rate of 10 C./min and starting at -150 the purpose of calculations the heat of melting (.increment.H) of 100 wt. % crystalline polyethylene by DSC will be 290 joules/g. For the chlorinated polyolefins the sample weight for .increment.H measurements will exclude the weight of bound chlorine.</p><p>The polyolefin is desirably at least 85, more desirably at least 90 and preferably at least 95 mole % or at least 98 mole % repeat units from monoolefins of 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Preferably the repeat units of the polyolefin are from alpha-monoolefins having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably ethylene or propylene, and most preferably ethylene. The polyolefin can be prepared with any polymerization scheme but Ziegler-Natta, Phillips, and metallocene catalysts are preferred as they result in high weight percentages of crystallinity. The residual of the repeat units of the polyolefin can be other copolymerizable monomers. These will vary with the polymerization catalyst. Preferably the polyolefins have densities at 25 about 0.965, 0.97 or 0.98 g/cc. Desirably they have crystalline melting temperatures from about 110-140 135 or 140 about 0.01 to 40, about 0.05 to 20 preferred, and about 0.1 to 10 most preferred.</p><p>Studies of other systems have shown that the usefulness of di-block copolymers as compatibilizer in polymer blends depends more on their molecular structure rather than their block length. However block length must be sufficient to anchor them firmly into and/or onto the separate phases to provide sufficient interfacial adhesion. Most melt-blending processes involve short processing times, therefore very long blocks may be ineffective because of their very low diffusion rates.</p><p>The chlorination procedure can be done in any media, preferably water, which does not appreciably swell the polyolefin (e.g. less than 10% increase in volume due to equilibrium swelling of the precursor polyolefin at 25 increase). The chlorination temperature is desirably less than 100 C. and more desirably from about 40 to about 90 or 100 preferably from about 50 to about 70 or 80 media can be a liquid at the chlorination conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) or a gas. The polyolefin is desirably in a particulate form with average particle size desirably from about 20 to about 500 μm. The chlorine can be added as a gas or a liquid and can be at pressures from about 5 or 10 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) to several hundred psia, and is preferably from about 15 to about 90 psia and most preferably from about 50 to about 90 psia. Desirably any oxygen which may be in the reactor or with the polyolefin is removed prior to chlorination. The amount of chlorine added can be determined in both systems by weight difference measurements either on the reactor or on the chlorine source. Alternatively or additionally the chlorine can be metered in.</p><p>Depending on the chlorination temperature it may be desirable to provide a free radical source, a catalyst, or ultraviolet radiation (UV) to accelerate the reaction. Example of free radical sources include organic peroxyesters. Example of catalysts include oxygen. Examples of UV radiation include any light source capable of providing radiation in the UV range. These free radical sources, catalysts, and UV sources are well known to the chlorination art and the type, amount, and optimization of use are available in numerous patents and publications on chlorinating polymers in general and more particularly chlorinating polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene. The difference between the prior art and the process of this disclosure is the chlorination speed, general absence of swelling solvents, and low temperature. After the chlorination is finished the chlorinated polyolefin is recovered from the media. Any byproducts (e.g. HCI, etc.) can be removed or neutralized along with the removal of the excess chlorine, if any. Then the chlorinated polyethylene can be washed and dried in conventional manner.</p><p>The chlorinated polyolefin desirably has a chlorine content from about 10, 20, 25, 27, 30, or 35 wt. % bound chlorine to about 50, 55, or 60 wt. % chlorine. Generally, the lower chlorine content chlorinated polyolefins are preferred compatibilizers for PVC and the higher chlorine content chlorinated polyolefins are preferred compatibilizers for high chlorine content CPVC. Intermediate chlorine content chlorinated polyolefins are preferred for intermediate chlorine content CPVC. Desirably the chlorinated polyolefin has at least 20, 30, 40, or 50 wt. % and more preferably from about 40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 to about 70, 80, 90, 95, or more wt. % residual crystallinity. The percent residual crystallinity is the crystallinity of the chlorinated polyolefin corrected for the chlorine content, expressed as a percentage of the crystallinity of the polyolefin precursor. A more detailed description and example calculations follow later. Desirably the crystalline phase has a melting temperature similar to the starting polyolefin (e.g. about 110, 120 or 124 130, 135, or 140 retains at least 10, 12, 15, or 20 wt. % blocks of crystalline polyolefin based on the weight of the chlorinated polyolefin less the weight of the bound chlorine atoms.</p><p>The polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is desirably a polymer or copolymer having at least 70 wt. % repeat units from vinyl chloride and up to 30 wt. % repeat units from other copolymerizable monomers. These polymers are well known to the art and are commercially available. Desirably the PVC is at least 80 or 90 wt. % repeat units from vinyl chloride with the residual of up to 10 or 20 wt. % being copolymerizable monomers. Comonomers include alkyl-acrylates, vinyl acetate, acrylonitriles, styrene etc. Generally PVC has a Vicat B softening temperature (ASTM D-1525) of about 75 to about 120 Desirably the PVC has an inherent viscosity as measured by ASTM D-1 234-66 from about 0.4 to about 1.6, more desirably from about 0.5 to about 1.6 and a density from about 1.3 to about 1.4 g/cm.sup.3.</p><p>The chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) is also known to the art and readily commercially available. Desirably it has a chlorine content from about 57, 59, 63, or 65 wt. % to about 71, 73, or 74 wt. %. Desirably it has been prepared from a PVC having an inherent viscosity of from about 0.5 or 0.6 to about 1.2. The inherent viscosity of the CPVC, although harder to measure than that of PVC, is generally the same as the precursor PVC. CPVC is often made in solution process, fluidized bed process, water-slurry process, thermal process, or a liquid chlorine process. The CPVC resins generally have a glass transition temperature of at least 10 resin from which they were made. Desirably the PVC from which the CPVC was made had at least 95 wt. % repeat units from vinyl chloride.</p><p>As is practiced in the art the PVC resin can be blended in a variety of proportions with the CPVC resin to prepare polymer compositions with intermediate properties (such as softening temperature) to those of PVC or CPVC. These blends may also be impact modified by the blocky chlorinated polyolefins and polyolefin elastomers of this disclosure.</p><p>The polyolefin elastomers useful herein generally have at least 90 or at least 95 wt. % repeat units from two or more olefin monomers, more desirably two or more alpha-monoolefin monomers. The olefin monomers of interest have from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and more desirably from 2 to 4, 6 or 8 carbon atoms. Desirably the weight ratio of repeat units of the first olefin to the repeat units of the second olefin is from about 20:80 to about 80:20. These ratios are sufficient to minimize the formation of crystalline phases so that a rubbery polymer is obtained. The preferred polyolefin elastomer is an ethylene copolymer having from about 50 to 85 wt. % repeat units from ethylene and about 15 to about 50 wt. % repeat units from a different alpha-monoolefin having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples include ethylene-propylene (EPR), ethylene-butene, ethylene-hexene, and ethylene-octene copolymers available from various suppliers selected from Dow, DSM, Bayer, Uniroyal, Union Carbide and Exxon. Optionally the ethylene copolymer may have up to 10 wt. % or from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. % repeat units from a nonconjugated polyunsaturated linear or cyclic olefin of 5 to 20 carbon atoms. An example of an ethylene copolymer having said repeat units from a polyunsaturated linear or cyclic olefin is ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM). Examples of the polyunsaturated olefin include dicyclopentadiene, substituted norbornenes, and 1,4 or 1,5 hexadiene. The polyolefin elastomers generally have a Mooney viscosity ML 1+4@ 125 D-1646ISO 289) of from about 5 to 150 preferably 10 to 70. Generally lower viscosity rubbers are preferred for the lower viscosity PVC compounds and higher viscosity rubbers are preferred for the higher viscosity CPVC compounds.</p><p>Randomly chlorinated polyolefins can be used in the PVC and/or CPVC compositions to impart particular characteristics (e.g. aid fusion and dispersion and enhance impact strength). Dow Chemical sells Tyrin™, a randomly chlorinated polyethylene, specifically for inclusion with PVC and CPVC. The Tyrin™ products typically have between 0 and 25 wt. % residual crystallinity from the starting polyethylene. Chlorinated polyolefins, e.g. polyethylene, can have densities below that of the polyolefin e.g. 0.91 to 0.98 g/cc or above that of the polyolefin e.g. 1.00 to 1.4 g/cc depending on the chlorine content. The addition of a small amount of chlorine randomly along the entire polymer chain disrupts the crystallinity. Since the crystalline portions are denser than the amorphous regions this lowers the density. Due to the dense nature of chlorine the addition of more chlorine pushes the density of chlorinated polyolefins up above 1 to about 1.4 g/cc when chlorine atoms are present in sufficient amount. Randomly chlorinated polyolefins have lower heat of melting than blocky chlorinated polyolefins.</p><p>The amounts of the blocky chlorinated polyolefins and polyolefin rubbers in the PVC and/or CPVC compounds is traditionally based upon 100 parts by weight of the base PVC and/or CPVC resin. The amount of the blocky chlorinated polyolefin (b-CPE) is desirably from about 0.5 to about 10 parts by weight, more desirably from about 0.5 to about 5 parts by weight. The amount of the polyolefin elastomer (POE) is desirably from about 1 to about 15 or 20 parts by weight and more desirably from about 1 to about 10 parts by weight. The amount of the randomly chlorinated polyolefin, if present, is desirably from about 0.1 or 0.5 to about 10 parts by weight and more desirably from about 0.5 to about 5 parts by weight.</p><p>PVC and/or CPVC can be compounded with a wide variety of other ingredients to increase processability and other properties of the in-process or finished (molded or shaped) article. Thermal stabilizers are beneficial and include for example di-butyl tin compounds in amounts from about 1 to about 5 parts by weight per 100 parts PVC and/or CPVC. Other stabilizers may include metal salts of phosphoric acid, polyols, or epoxidized oils. These can be used in amounts from about 0.1 to about 7 parts by weight. Lubricants such as paraffin waxes, low molecular weight polyethylene, oxidized polyethylenes, fatty acids and their salts, fatty alcohols, metal soaps, fatty amides, fatty esters, can be included in PVC and/or CPVC compounds. Viscosity modifiers such as Paraloid™ K 120 ND from Rohm and Haas can be added. Fillers are optional and include clay, silica, wollastonite, mica, barytes, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxides, and talc.</p><p>The method of compounding is straightforward as any high intensity method known to uniformly mix and fuse the components into a homogeneous compound such as a Banbury mill, followed by sheeting, slitting or extrusion into pellets or cubes can be used. The differences in processing and handling of CPVC compared with PVC relate mainly to the temperature and viscosity differences and care to avoid too much work and shear burning. Alternatively a twin screw extruder or other effective high shear mixer may be substituted for one or more of the above steps.</p><p>A characteristic property of the blocky chlorinated polyethylenes synthesized by this process is their substantial remaining crystallinity which was measured by thermal analysis, i.e, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As is known, DSC, as described in "Textbook of Polymer Science" by Fred Billmeyer (second edition, page 121), is a technique in which the temperature of a reference substance and a sample are measured and controlled to conform to a predetermined time-temperature program. At the same time, temperature differences which develop between the reference and the sample, especially when the sample undergoes a thermal transition, are compared and the heat input in both the reference or the sample is adjusted to maintain equal temperatures. A signal proportional to these power differences is then plotted. The area under the resulting curve is a direct measure of the heat of transition. The percent crystallinity of the blocky chlorinated polyethylenes can be quantitatively estimated by comparing the area under the peak corresponding to the heat of melting, divided by the area under the peak corresponding to the heat of melting of a standard sample of known crystallinity. For the purpose of calculations 100 wt. % crystalline polyethylene will be assigned a heat of melting (.increment.H) of 290 joules/gram. The residual crystallinity of the chlorinated polyethylenes here-in cited can be estimated using the ratio of the corrected heat of melting (enthalpy of fusion) of the as prepared chlorinated samples (i.e., corrected so to be estimated per gram of polyethylene by subtracting the weight of bound chlorine from the sample weight) over the enthalpy of fusion of the starting polyethylene (%.increment.HR of residual polyethylene crystallinity).</p><p>An example of the calculation for the residual polyethylene crystallinity of a chlorinated polyethylene is as follow:</p><p>The enthalpy of fusion (.increment.H) for a chlorinated polyethylene, containing 25 wt. % chlorine (about 75 wt. % polyethylene) was measured by DSC and found to be .increment.H.sub.CPEuncorrected =117 J/g. So the enthalpy of fusion per gram of polyethylene (corrected for the weight of chlorine) will be .increment.H.sub.CPE =117/0.75 or .increment.H.sub.CPE =156 J/gPE. The enthalpy of fusion of the starting polyethylene before chlorination was found to be .increment.H.sub.PE =161 J/g. So the residual polyethylene crystallinity can be calculated as being the ratio 156/161 or about 0.97, i.e. 97% of residual polyethylene crystallinity. This shows that essentially only the amorphous polyethylene phase was chlorinated.</p><p>Chlorine content of the blocky chlorinated polyethylenes (b-CPE) were measured by .sup.13 C-NMR. Approximately 10 wt. % of b-CPE is dissolved in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Benzene-d6 is added at about 10% by volume of the total solvent for the deuterium lock. One drop of hexamethyldisiloxane is added as a chemical shift reference. Carbon-13 data is collected with overnight data accumulation using conditions such as, 110 measurement temperature, total delay time between pulses of 7.5 seconds, 90 no corrections for Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) differences.</p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>Example 1</p><p>Chlorinated Polyethylene From UV Irradiation</p><p>A 2-gallon jacketed reactor (suitable for chlorination reactions) provided with means of agitation, feed lines, pressure and temperature recording instruments, and appropriate valves and piping was charged with 4000 g of demineralized water, 0.3 g of a commercial wetting agent (Thompson-Hayward T-DET-N8) and 300 g of high density polyethylene powder (Microthene™ FA700-00 from Quantum Chemical Corporation), having a density of 0.953 g/cm.sup.3 as measured by ASTM D-1505 on compression molded samples and a melt index of 10.5 g/10 min according to ASTM D-1 238 FR-E.

The results can be distinguished from those produced by the water-slurry process described previously in Example 1. The polyethylene used in the article had weight and number average molecular weight of 2.8.times.10.sup.5 and 4 respectively by GPC. In a typical suspension chlorination in TCE, 25 g of the dried polyethylene powder (250 μm average particle size) was placed in a three-neck reaction flask with 750 ml of certified reagent grade 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. The 2-liter jacketed reactor was equipped with appropriate nitrogen and chlorine inlets, UV lamps and mechanical agitation. The reaction was carried out under ultraviolet radiation at 60  chlorine. After the desired reaction time, the reaction was quenched in a large volume of methanol. The resulting polymer was filtered, washed several times with methanol and vacuum dried at 60 week. The chlorine content was determined by .sup.13 C-NMR as described previously. The most characteristic property of the chlorinated polyethylenes synthesized in the water-slurry process is the extent of their blockiness which is correlated by their substantial residual crystallinity as previously defined.
