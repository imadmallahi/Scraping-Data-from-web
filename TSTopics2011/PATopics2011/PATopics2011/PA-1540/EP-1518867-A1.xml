copolymerizable esters, to films using such polymers and stretch hood packaging
process using such films. The films may, in one use, be employed to package an
object or collection of objects generally supported on a pallet or other supporting
platform for storage or transportation. The invention relates especially to cases where
the polymer is an interpolymer of ethylene and a copolymerizable ester and to multi-layer
films where a skin layer is provided on one or both sides of a core layer.</p><heading><b><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0002">The term stretch hood refers to one form of packaging system in which a
film tube is used to form a hood to bundle and protect goods. The goods may be a
single object such as white goods (a washing machine or refrigerator) or electronic
goods. The goods may be a collection of objects such as bottles, bags of soil, cement,
fertilizer, polymer pellets or concrete blocks, bricks, tiles, insulation materials. The
object or objects are often supported on a pallet or other supporting platform, referred
to herein as a palletized load, to permit handling by a forklift device. The film tube is
conveniently produced by blown film extrusion, which may involve coextrusion, to
produce a tube from an annular die. Using blown film extrusion, the extruded tube is
flattened for later use without slitting it longitudinally. Stretch hood relies on elastic
contraction of the film tube around the object or collection of objects to be packaged,
after a stretching device has placed the tube in a stretched condition around the object
or collection of objects to be packaged to form the hood. The hood protects, holds the
palletized load together against spillage if necessary and shields the palletized load
from damage and environmental factors (moisture) during transportation and storage. 
The hood may be sealed at one end to protect and cover the top of the palletized load.
Alternatively, the hood may be open at the top where protection is a lower priority.</p><p num="0003">Stretch hood packaging systems may provide certain advantages over
other forms of packaging of palletized loads such as shrink hood, where a film tube is
shrunk by the application of heat, or stretch wrap where a flat film is wrapped around
the object or collection of objects to be packaged. In shrink hood a film containing a
highly oriented polymer (often LDPE with optionally some LLDPE) is melt oriented
upon extrusion and shrinks and thickens when shrunk around and onto a palletized
load. Heat has to be applied to shrink the film into the position where it provides the
holding force that holds load together against spillage. The process consumes
significant energy and the use of heat creates safety debits. The film is relatively thick
and stiff and need not be designed to stretch easily prior to heat shrinking. In stretch
wrap, a more linear polymer (often linear low-density polyethylene LLDPE with
optionally some VLDPE (an ethylene copolymer of lower density than the LLDPE) is
extruded to provide the required stretching characteristics. A tackifying polymer or
other ingredients must be added to establish sufficient a cling force on the surface.
The film can cling to itself strongly when rolled up (referred to as blocking) and
excessive noise may result when unrolling the film at high speed. The film is
relatively thin and designed to stretch easily to considerable levels of over 200 % for
its application around a load. The holding force is provided by the contracting force
exerted by the stretched film. Stretch wrap is applied as a flat, non-tubular film and
may give incomplete protection against environmental factors.</p><p num="0004">This invention concerns inter-polymers, and multi-layer films, which are
described in terms of their utility for stretch hood applications. However these
polymers and films may have performance features that provide utility elsewhere.
Appropriate uses might be stretch sleeve to apply a label to a bottle or agricultural
films for silage or greenhouse film or for collation shrink applications. </p><p num="0005">The application of a film tube to package the object or collection of
objects on a stretch hood packaging machine involves the steps described by way of
example in EP0461667 for the case where the top of the stretch hood is sealed.</p><p num="0006">In a first step (see Figure 1 and 2 of EP0461667) a flattened film tube is
unrolled and opened up to fit around a stretcher, which may be in the form of a frame
as shown or in the form of four comer devices as illustrated in Figure 6. At this stage
the top of the tube can be heat sealed before it is cut-off, creating an inverted bag. The
stretcher device can enter the inverted bag from below. The film material is gathered
around the stretcher by take down rollers at each comer (not shown in the Figures).
The film is gripped in a nip between the stretcher and the rollers. The takedown
rollers cause the film to be folded transversely and gathered on the stretcher. The film
and rollers have to have enough friction for an efficient gathering and take down
operation. The heat sealing at the top end of the tube requires high hot tack and seal
strength to survive subsequent stretching. The gathered, transversely folded tube is
then expanded by the stretcher in the transverse film direction beyond the external
dimensions of the palletized load. This requires a pre-determined elasticity that
permits stretching and a reversion of the stretch later upon relaxation (see Figure 3 of
EP0461667). The expanded stretcher with the transversely stretched film tube is then
passed downwards over the palletized load unfolding and releasing the film (see
Figure 4 of EP0461667). This requires that the film tube, in its tensioned condition,
has a moderate coefficient of friction with the stretcher to allow it to be released
easily from the stretcher while at the same time submitting the film to a sufficient
force in the machine direction to achieve a moderate degree of machine direction
stretch. The stretcher remains in the expanded state after releasing the lower edge of
the film hood and returns upwards to the starting positions past the hood, sealed at the
top, now contracted around the palletized load. </p><p num="0007">Different film tube structures have been suggested for stretch hood.
WO00/37543 discloses on a three-layer film using a blend of a metallocene produced
plastomer (page 8, lines 10 to 16) and a predominant amount of ethylene (E) vinyl
acetate (VA) with a high amount of VA in a core layer and surface layers of an EVA
with low VA content containing SiO<sub>2</sub> as anti-block friction modifier. The term
plastomer is used to indicate a low density copolymer of ethylene and α-olefins. The
EVA polymers used in WO00/37543 are produced in a high-pressure process,
generally in an autoclave reactor as described by way of example in EP0099646.
These polymers generally come in the two types referred to in WO00/37543: low VA
and high VA.</p><p num="0008">The use of high EVA limits the contracting force of the film hood. The
film tends to be soft, is easily stretched but only exerts a limited force to return to its
pre-stretched state. The high EVA is vulnerable to ambient heat and the film holding
force may be weakened. These drawbacks can only be partially compensated by the
addition of the plastomer. The surface friction provided by the low EVA skin layers,
generally having a broader molecular weight distribution, can only controlled
imprecisely by high amounts of anti-block, which has a negative effect on the
transparency and mechanical properties.</p><p num="0009">Overall the film of WO00/37543 provides a weak holding force upon
contraction after it has been stretched to a considerable degree in stretch hood
packaging. The film thickness may have to be increased to obtain a sufficient holding
force. Once stretched and contracted around a load, the hood may have a low
puncture resistance and, once punctured, a poor tear propagation resistance, which
can easily provoke a spill of the palletized load. Full stretching can also lead to wash
boarding where different parts of the film stretch differently, giving rise to thicker
and thinner film portions. Furthermore, the holding force can weaken when the
palletized load is exposed to more elevated temperatures. Adjustment of the 
coefficient of friction for a particular stretch hood packaging machine or packaging
purpose may be unduly limited in range and/or difficult to achieve without detracting
from other desired film properties. Many stretchable, elastomeric polymers are
inherently sticky. If such a polymer is selected for the surface of stretch hood film,
high levels of anti-block may be needed to allow the heat-sealed top of the hood to
flatten and fit closely around the pelletized load. Such anti-block levels may make the
film opaque and interfere with the mechanical and optical properties.</p><p num="0010">US6291038 described a heat shrinkable film with a medium VA EVA
having from 9 to 20 wt % of VA, and a narrow molecular weight distribution and
high degree of short chain branching.</p><p num="0011">As used herein, short chain branching refers to alkyl branches, detectable
through 13C NMR techniques and excludes acetoxy branches from the incorporation
of vinyl acetate comonomer. Short chain branching as so defined in polymers made in
high-pressure free-radical polymerization, results mainly from the Roedel backbiting
mechanisms that lead to ethyl and butyl type branches as well as some higher levels
of branching. Other short chain branches result from the incorporation along the chain
of α-olefins which have generally the effect or the intent of lowering the molecular
weight and are referred to as telogens or transfer agents. The use of propylene transfer
agent results in methyl-type short chain branches. The use of isobutylene would also
result in methyl-type short chain branches. Using NMR techniques the number of
carbon atoms in the short chain branch can be determined and also the number of the
respective types of short chain branches. Where reference is made 1000 C atoms as
the basis for expressing the amount of SCB or LCB, the reference to the 1000 C
atoms refers to all carbon atoms, including carbon atoms in acetoxy groups, unless
otherwise mentioned. </p><p num="0012">Atofina markets a grade of low VA content EVA polymer: EVATANE
(Registered Trade Mark) 1005VN3, which has a VA content of 3.5 mol % (9.8 wt %)
and a Melt Index of 0.33. The film has limited short chain branching and a low
relaxation time.</p><p num="0013">Accordingly, known film structures for stretch hood packaging limit the
performance and savings obtainable from stretch-hood packaging systems. The range
of applications in which it would perform competitively against stretch film or shrink
hood packaging maybe unduly restricted.</p><p num="0014">It is among the objects of the invention to improve the performance of
stretch hood packaging films. In particular it is among the objects to achieve a better
balance between stretchability and holding force. It is among the objects to permit a)
a reduction in the weight of film needed to provide a given holding force in stretch
hood packaging; b) better friction control and a more even stretching of the film for
the stretch hood packaging operation and/or c) improved package integrity and
transparency, resistance to puncture and tearing, and/or reduced stress relaxation at
higher ambient temperatures after the stretch hood packaging operation has been
completed.</p><heading><b><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0015">The invention has as one aspect a new ethylene based polymer, which may
be used to improve stretch film performance. The invention has as another aspect a
new film structure and composition which may be used to improve stretch film
performance. In the aspect relating to the film structure the new ethylene polymer
may be used as a core layer. Alternatively core layers of yet different compositions,
such as conventional EVA inter-polymers, may be used in the film structure context.
Each of these aspects can contribute to the stretch hood film performance; the aspects 
are cumulative with the superior performance available from a combination of these
aspects.</p><p num="0016">In one aspect there is provided a polymer comprising units derived from
ethylene, said polymer having:
<sl><li>a) a Melt Index of from 0.05 to 20 g/10 min as determined by ASTM-1238
Condition E;</li><li>b) at least 10 per 1000 C-atoms of short chain branches, containing five
carbon atoms or less, as determined by C13 NMR, and less than 3.5 mol % of units
derived from a copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated ester,</li><li>c) a density of from 0.90 to 0.94 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 0.91 to 0.935 g/cm<sup>3</sup>,
especially 0.92 to 0.93 g/cm<sup>3</sup> as determined by ASTM D1505, and</li><li>d) a relaxation time as described herein of at least 10 s.</li></sl></p><p num="0017">Most of these parameters are well known in the art. The relaxation time is
rheologically derived and reflects the time taken for the polymer chains to relax after
deformation in a molten condition. It is influenced by aspects of the polymer structure
such as the long chain branching level, molecular weight and molecular weight
distribution if the relaxation time is too high the polymer will strain harden
prematurely during cold stretching. A higher relaxation time encourages balanced
melt orientation of the film during blown film extrusion. In use Transverse Direction
(TD) stretching will then permit some stretching in the Machine Direction (MD)
without rupture to provide a top to bottom holding force in addition to a sideways
holding force.</p><p num="0018">Preferably the polymer contains at least four, especially five SCB per
thousand carbon atoms containing three carbon atoms or less. Preferably the
relaxation time is at least 11 and/or less than 20, or less than 15. </p><p num="0019">The polymer of the invention may conveniently be produced in free-radical
polymerization, preferably using a tubular reactor. The ethylene derived units
suitably form more than 85 wt % of the polymer. The amount of short chain
branches, containing 5 carbon atoms or less, is suitably less than 30, preferably less
than 20 per 1000 C-atoms.</p><p num="0020">The copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated ester may be absent but
preferably the polymer contains from 1 to 3 mol % of units derived from the
copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated ester and/or at least 1 per 1000 C-atoms of
long chain branches containing 6 or more carbon atoms as determined by C13 NMR.
The ethylenically unsaturated ester may be ethylene methacrylate and its higher
acrylate analogues such as ethylene ethyl acrylate but is preferably ethylene vinyl
acetate. If the VA content is too high ester the polymer may not contract sufficiently
after extension to develop the desired holding force. Suitably also the polymer has a
bimodal molecular weight distribution as determined by GPC DRI and/or the
relaxation time is less than 20 s. The bimodality may be apparent as a shoulder in a
graph representing the molecular weight distribution.</p><p num="0021">While the polymer may have a Melt Index of less than 20 g/10 min,
preferably less than 15 and especially less than 10 g/10 min, it is preferred for blown
film extrusion that the polymer has a Melt Index of from 0.1 to 4 g/10 min; preferably
less than 2 g/10 min and especially less than 1 g/10 min.</p><p num="0022">In another aspect the invention, the polymer is described in terms of the
process features used in its manufacture, which result in its unique properties. In this
preferred aspect the invention provides a polymer comprising units derived from
ethylene obtainable by free radical polymerization using a chain transfer agent that
incorporates into the polymer chain, preferably propylene, as a chain transfer agent to
provide a polymer having a Melt Index of from 0.05 to 20 g/10 min as determined by 
ASTM-D 1238 Condition E; and at least 10 per 1000 C-atoms of short chain
branches, containing five carbon atoms or less, as determined by C 13 NMR and less
than 3.5 mol % of units derived from a copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated
ester.</p><p num="0023">The free radical polymerization may be performed in a stirred autoclave
but is preferably produced in a tubular reactor under circumstances to favor LCB
formation in a down stream part of the tubular reactor and preferably has a density of
from 0.90 to 0.94 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably 0.91 to 0.935 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, especially 0.92 to 0.93
g/cm<sup>3</sup> as determined by ASTM D1505, and/or preferably has a relaxation time as
described herein of at least 10 s. LCB formation may be favored reduced transfer
agent concentration and/or increased temperature in a downstream part of the tubular
reactor. The features of the polymer of the invention discussed above in terms of the
density, relaxation time, ethylene content, short chain branch levels, molecular weight
distribution and Melt Index can equally be applied to this aspect of the invention.</p><p num="0024">The transfer agent is preferably selected to provide a high propensity to
incorporate. Hence propylene is preferred and comprises preferably from 60 to 100 %
of the total transfer agent content. However smaller amounts of other transfer agents
(isobutylene, aldehydes) may be used.</p><p num="0025">More broadly the process for producing the polymer may be a free radical
polymerization process comprising feeding ethylene and a copolymerizable
ethylenically unsaturated ester and propylene as a chain transfer agent, under
conditions favoring formation of short chain branches by backbiting and propylene
incorporation to provide a polymer having a Melt Index of from 0.05 to 20 g/10 min
as determined by ASTM-D 1238 Condition E; and optionally less than 3.5 mol % of
units derived from the copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated ester. The 
conditions of polymerization may be adapted to obtain the optional and preferred
polymer features described previously.</p><p num="0026">Preferably the polymerization is performed in a tubular reactor at from
2200 to 2700 bar and from 180 to 330 °C with multiple injection of feed and initiator
but with reduced or no injection of monomer and optionally reduced and/or no or
reduced injection of transfer agent at a downstream reaction zone. A final
temperature peak at a downstream reaction zone with reduced or no monomer
injection may be in excess of the temperature peak of at least two temperature peaks
at two reaction zones upstream of the final reaction zone. The final temperature peak
at a downstream reaction zone with reduced or no monomer injection may be in
excess of the temperature peak of at least one temperature peak at a reaction zone
upstream thereof at which monomer is injected.</p><p num="0027">The polymer of the invention may be used for stretch hood packaging by
forming the polymer into a film, which may be a mono-layer or multi-layer structure,
capable of TD stretching by at least 100 % and ensuring retention of that film around
a load by subsequent elastic recovery. The film structure is selected appropriately.</p><p num="0028">Preferably the film has a main layer with at least 50 wt %, based on the
total weight of polymers in the main layer, of a polymer with any one or more of the
features described previously, said film having an elastic recovery after a 100 %
stretch of at least 40 % and providing a normalized holding force per 100 µm
thickness pre-stretch at 85 % stretch, after an initial stretch of 100 %, of at least 20
N/50 mm at a deformation rate of less than 10 % of the original starting length per
second.</p><p num="0029">In industrial application the behavior and performance of the film when
processed at the speeds practised in industry, generally higher than those used in 
laboratory equipment, is important. A suitable mono-or multi-layer structure can
provide such performance also at higher rates of deformation such as those in excess
of 12 % of the original starting length per second. Such a film can be used to
minimize the amount of film material needed to establish a sufficient holding force
and also optimize the film behavior during extension and after contraction around a
load on a stretch hood packaging line with reduced risk of tearing or puncturing.</p><p num="0030">The tensile-stress behavior when the film is stretched at ambient
temperatures for stretch hood packaging is also of interest. Usually in a graph of the
extension or stretch versus the stress applied, the initial slope is steepest. The
information can be extracted as the Secant Modulus. Preferably the Secant modulus
of the un-stretched film is less than 120 MPa. The Elmendorf tear strength is at least
10 g/µm, preferably at least 12 g/µm and less than 25 g/µm.</p><p num="0031">Generally speaking the steeper the initial slope, the stiffer the film and the
more power will be needed to stretch it initially. After the initial extension, the slope
flattens and less force is needed for each further increment of extension of the film.
The slope may become negative where a further increment of extension requires less
force than a previous increment. Preferably the film can be extended up to 100 %
while providing a minimum tensile test slope of at least 0.01 MPa per % elongation.
This helps to avoid "wash boarding" which undermines the visual appearance and
creates highly stretched parts that are prone to puncture and can split the film after it
has contracted around a load. The polymer of the invention assists in maintaining
minimum tensile test slope of at least 0.01 MPa per % elongation throughout the
stretching process.</p><p num="0032">In the film the polymer of the invention may be used on its own or in a
mixture with another polymer. The reasons for adding another polymeric component
include helping processability by increased presence of long chain branching or 
broader molecular weight distribution; or increasing strength in the end film by use of
a more crystalline polymer. If necessary the film may comprise a copolymerizable
ethylenically unsaturated ester, preferably vinyl acetate, having a content of
copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated ester of from 4 to 10 mol % and/or an
ethylene α-olefin interpolymer having a density of from 0.915 to 0.86 and an MI of
from 0.5 to 5 to help in achieving the positive tensile slope of at least 0.01 MPa per %
elongation up to 100 % stretch. Presence of the ethylene α-olefin interpolymer can
contribute to snap-back, that is to say the speed of elastic recovery.</p><p num="0033">Suitably the film has a multi-layer structure (such as a three or five layer
structure) with a skin layer arranged to one or both sides of the main layer. The skin
layer or layers may comprise a linear low density ethylene copolymer (LLDPE)
having a density of from 0.91 to 0.94. The structure is preferably an A/B/C structure
where C may be the same as or different from A. At least one skin layer should be an
LLDPE. The other skin layer may be a different LLDPE or a non-LLDPE material.
The film of the invention may be made by blown film extrusion in tubular form
adapted to form a stretch hood capable of transverse direction extension of at least
100 % and subsequent elastic recovery.</p><p num="0034">The film appearance is preserved upon extension and significant
immobilizing or holding force can be developed. Depending on the composition of
the film, the loss in holding force encountered upon heating of the palletized load can
be substantially restricted to less than 40 % of that originally when heated to
temperatures of up to 45 °C, possibly even up 50 °C or 55 °C or 60 °C.</p><p num="0035">In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a film having a
coefficient of friction of from 0.2 to 10, preferably from 0.3 to 0.8, and most
preferably from 0.4 to 0.7 for stretch hood packaging comprising:
<sl><li>a) a core polymeric layer; and </li><li>b) a skin layer , on each side of the core which may be of the same or
different composition, comprising at least 60 wt % of an LLDPE having density of
0.91 to 0.94 g/cm<sup>3</sup> as determined by ASTM-D 1238 Condition E and hexane
extractables less than 1.5 wt %, preferably less than 1 wt %, especially less than
0.6 wt %, said skin layer containing less than 7500 , preferably less than 3000 ppm of
anti-block particulates and said film having an elastic recovery after a 100 % stretch
of at least 40 % and providing a normalized holding force per 100 µm thickness pre-stretch
at 85 % stretch after an initial stretch of 100 % of at least 20 N/50 mm. This is
normally done at a deformation rate of less than 10 % of the starting length per
second. The FDA hexane extractable test used here and in the examples was from the
version current to 07 July 2003. The test was performed according to 21 CFR
177.1520 (d)(3)(ii)(e) using a film for extraction and weighing the dried film after ;
extraction and drying to measure the weight loss.</li></sl></p><p num="0036">The LLDPE can be conveniently prepared by polymerization using a
transition metal compound as a catalyst. The polymerization may be gas phase, slurry
or solution polymerization for example.</p><p num="0037">The anti-block particulates project from the surface of the film to reduce
the areas of inter-film contact. Its use is generally minimized to maintain film clarity.
Preferably the skin layer contains less than 2500 ppm of particulate, more preferably
less than 2000. Particle sizes of talc or silica anti-block useful for anti-block in films
may vary as is well known in the art. The slip agents are designed to migrate to the
surface to provide a lubricating film to reduce the coefficient of friction. The relative
amounts of slip-agent and any anti-block are influenced by the basic frictional and
cling characteristics of the LLDPE skin. Using the invention, coefficients of friction
suitable for stretch hood packaging can be established. </p><p num="0038">The handling of the film under tension during the stretch hood packaging
operation may be improved in this way and be adapted more easily to different
requirements. The use of an elastic film, which has to be treated with high levels of
anti-block to reduce friction, is avoided. Instead of starting from a low level of anti-block
present, the target coefficient of friction can be obtained by the judicious
addition of a slip agent. The wash-boarding problem can be mitigated by the use of an
LLDPE made using a single site catalyst (e.g. a metallocene) having a tensile test
slope of at least 0.01 MPa per % elongation up to 100 % extension, for example that
made as described in WO98/44011 incorporated by reference herein for US purposes.
The top of the stretch hood can be heat sealed to provide a high bond strength.</p><p num="0039">Having used slip agent to achieve a target coefficient of friction, it can be
advantageous to ensure that coefficient is maintained after manufacture of the film
and before use in stretch hood packaging. This may be achieved by using an amount
of migratable component in the core layer to minimize changes in the coefficient of
friction in the skin layer by cross-migration between the layers. By making this film
structure using blown film extrusion, the film solidification after extrusion of the
bubble is influenced so as to provide improved transparency.</p><p num="0040">The core layer may be chosen from a wide range of options including high
EVA; blends of high EVA with other materials. However superior results may be
obtained by using as the core layer of the main layer described with the reference to
the polymer of the invention. The film then may undergo major levels of stretching
(well over 50 %) on a stretching device of the stretch hood packaging machine in the
course of the application of the stretch hood to the palletized load. The resistance to
stretching by friction against a gripper surface of the stretch hood packaging machine
then has to be controlled carefully, particularly when thin films are used which
become even thinner in the course of stretching. Thus this aspect of the invention, for
giving medium to low friction skin layers, may be usefully combined with the other 
aspect of the invention, which provides a polymer and films with a high level of SCB
and a high relaxation time that can be highly stretched.</p><p num="0041">Satisfactory results are obtained where the skin layers constitute jointly
from 10 to 60 % of the overall film thickness, preferably from 30 to 50 %. The film
thickness can vary within plus or minus 5 % of the average, yet wash boarding can be
minimized. Advantageously the average thickness of the film pre-stretch varies from
25 to 300 µm. Advantageously the overall average film thickness may be from 25 to
75 µm while still providing satisfactory stretch hood packaging performance. The
film can be formulated overall to provide a minimum tensile test slope of at least
0.01 MPa; a Secant modulus before stretching of less than 120 MPa and/or an
Elmendorf tear strength of at least 10 g/µm. The film structure is selected
appropriately.</p><p num="0042">The high puncture and tear resistance can permit the production of films
that are perforated to facilitate fluid permeability of the stretch hood package, for
example to permit continued drying etc. The multi-layer film may be made by blown
film extrusion in tubular form adapted to form a stretch hood capable of transverse
direction extension of at least 100 % and subsequent elastic recovery.</p><p num="0043">The skin and core may also be modified by the use of additives. The core
and/or skin may be modified by the incorporation of a PPA processing additives or a
slip additive, including PP or HDPE as a polymeric anti-block additive.</p><p num="0044">Using various aspects of the invention, alone or in combination, stretch
hood systems can be optimized to minimize the amount of film needed, the energy
consumption for shrinking and/or applying the film and stickiness in the film
necessary for adhesion. The films can be applied and the packaged good stored in a
wide range of temperature conditions. In production by blown extrusion, good bubble 
stability can be achieved and the resulting film can have a high transparency due to
the low amount of particulate anti-block.</p><heading><b><u style="single">DETAILS OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0045">The ethylenically unsaturated ester may be vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate,
butyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate or a combination. The transfer agent used in the
production of the polymer of the invention can incorporate into the chain and this
assists in creating the short chain branches of the polymer. Preferably the transfer
agent is propylene, although higher olefins such as iso-butylene or butene-1 may be
used. NMR techniques struggle to differentiate branches having six or more carbon
atoms and these are referred to collectively as Long Chain Branches (LCB). The
presence of LCB in whatever amount or structure is reflected in the relaxation time.
The molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn by DRI is preferably at least 8 and
preferably bimodal, under which circumstances a high load/low load MI ratio is less
suited to reflect the influence of LCB.</p><p num="0046">The LLDPE for the skin layer of the film of the invention may be made by
gas phase polymerization processes such as those described in WO9425495
incorporated by reference for US purposes. The preferred material is an LLDPE with
some long chain branching which may be made by the process described in
WO98/44011 incorporated by reference for US purposes. The molecular weight
distribution expressed as a Mw/Mn value, as measured by DRI GPC, for the LLDPE
may vary from 2.0 to 3, preferably at least 2.5, especially at least 4, to 8, especially
less than 7. Overall orientation upon extrusion may be limited by selection of low
Mw/Mn such as from 2.3 to 3.5. This permits the orientation of the core layer to
dominate the film stretch properties. Some Long Chain Branching may assist in
establishing transverse orientation helpful against wash boarding. Short chain
branching may be provided by alpha-olefin comonomers having from 3 to 10 C-atoms,
such as butene-1, hexen-1 and octene-1. The Melt Index Ratio expressed in 
I<sub>21.6</sub>/I<sub>2.16</sub> may vary from 10, preferably more than 30, to 100, especially less than 80.
While the disclosures rely on metallocene single site supported catalysts, other
transition metal components may serve as single site catalysts and provide
appropriate polymer homogeneity and absence of low molecular weight extractables.
In addition conventional titanium based Ziegler Natta catalyst systems may be
optimized to reduce the production of low molecular weight extractables. Such
polymers can be equally suitable for the films of the invention.</p><p num="0047">The skin layer in the multi-layer film structures of the invention may
contain, in admixture with the LLDPE, small amounts, generally less than 20 wt % of
a high pressure low density polyethylene; a linear high density polyethylene or
polypropylene or a combination thereof. The core layer may contain small amounts,
generally less than 40 wt % of a linear very low density polyethylene having a
density of from 0.86 to 0.90, an LLDPE having a density of from 0.91 to 0.94; and/or
an elastomer with ethylene or propylene derived crystallinity. Layers may be
interposed between the core and skin layers, part of the purpose may be to limit the
amount of the more expensive polymers for the skin and core layers.</p><p num="0048">The amount of slip agent employed, especially that in the skin layers, is
preferably limited to max 500 ppm. If there is too much slip agent employed, then the
coefficient of friction will become too low, with resultant poor film handling in the
packaging machine. More preferably an amount of slip agent of 150 to 300 ppm is
used. Examples of slip agent that may be used are primary or secondary amides, such
as erucamide and oleamide. In addition to or instead of slip agent, an anti-agglomeration
additive may be used, for example stearates. If employed, such
additives would normally be used in greater amounts than required for the slip agent,
e.g. from 1000 to 5000 ppm. </p><p num="0049">The film preferably does not contain any tackifying agents such as PIB or
castor oil or similar additive. The presence of such tackifying additives will generally
have an adverse effect on control of coefficient of friction. It is believed, without
being bound by theory, that the core and skin layers each make distinct contributions
to the overall film properties. When the polymer composition of the skin and core
layers are blended into a single layer, the effects differ from when they are used in
distinct layers. Each layer makes its own contribution. By suitable combination of
skin and core layers, a film can be made which permits considerable stretching while
retaining its physical integrity and tear resistance, while at the same time the core
layer remains able to provide a optimized contracting force.</p><heading><b><u style="single">EXAMPLES</u></b></heading><p num="0050">The invention is explained by reference to the Examples in which mention

reactor by free radical initiation. Initiators used may be oxygen, peroxides and
similar agents. The chain transfer agent, instrumental in increasing the amount of
short chain branching is an alpha-olefin, generally consisting substantially of
propylene. The highly exothermic reaction is performed in a reactor operating under
high pressure (2000 to 3200 bar), under turbulent flow and at high temperatures (150
to 330 °C). The heat of polymerization is removed through the tube wall. Operating
conditions like reactor pressure, reactor temperature in the different reaction zones
and co-monomer and chain transfer agent concentrations are adjusted to achieve the
required product properties. The effect of operating conditions on product properties,

ethylene, vinyl acetate and transfer agent is supplied to a primary compressor 4 and
hence to a secondary compressor 6. The discharge flow of the secondary compressor
6 is divided in the number of streams required for the front and side streams of the
tubular reactor 8 as indicated by arrows Ib to IVb in Figure 2. The flow to the front
(upstream end) of the reactor 8 is heated at 10 while the flows to the side stream entry
points are cooled at 12. The side stream flows are then fed to injection points along
the length of the tubular reactor 8.</p><p num="0054">The tubular reactor 8 is a plug flow reactor with limited back-mixing.
Peroxide type initiator is supplied from storage at 20, mixed with solvent and
supplied by pump 22 to the reactor 8 at position indicated in Figure 2 at Ia to VIa.
Multiple peroxide injection points 24 are used along the length of the reactor 8 to
maximize conversion of ethylene to EVA polymer and optimize product properties.
Four or more injection points are used. It is to be noted that the final injection point or
points is in a tube section where the monomer feed is not supplied. Reactor
conversion rates can approach 40%.</p><p num="0055">The peroxide initiator initiates the free radical, exothermic polymerization
reaction. The reaction heat is removed by an increase of the temperature of the
ethylene, by injection of the cold side stream of ethylene and by heat transfer through
the reactor wall to a closed-loop jacket water cooling system. It is to be noted that in 
comparison with the usual temperature fluctuation as shown by line A, the
temperature fluctuates as shown by line B (see Figure 2). The temperature initially is
lower than usual. The temperature at the downstream portion, where no monomer
feed is supplied by a side-stream, is allowed to become higher than usual. The
conversion of ethylene to polymer is maximized by the use of reactor jacket water at
suitable cooling water temperatures. This cool jacket water maximizes the heat
transfer through the thick walled reactor pipes. The pressure drop along the length of
the reactor is minimized through the use of a stepped profile on reactor tube
diameters. Line A indicates the usual pressure-drop along the reactor length for
conventional EVA production; line B is indicative of the absolute pressure employed
for the EVA of the invention. This stepped profile optimizes the gas velocity along
the length of the reactor, which virtually eliminates fouling on the interior wall of the
tubular reactor.</p><p num="0056">An extensive distributed computer control system is used to control the
reactor temperature profile and other key process variables.</p><p num="0057">After polymerization (which takes about 20 to 40 seconds in tube with a
length of 1.8 km and a diameter of approximately 32.65 mm), the reaction fluid is
decompressed through the reactor pressure control valve 30 to about 300 barg and
cooled with the low pressure cold quench from the primary compressor discharge.
The mixture is then fed to the high pressure separator 32 where polymer is separated
from unreacted monomer. The use of the low pressure quench minimizes the
formation of gels and improves the clarity. Recycled monomer is recycled as at 33 to
the secondary compressor 6.</p><p num="0058">The molten polymer and a small amount of entrained ethylene are again
decompressed to approx. 0.7 barg through a low pressure let-down valve and fed to 
the low pressure separator 34. At this point most of the remaining entrained monomer
is separated from the EVA and is sent to the purge gas compression system 35.</p><p num="0059">The purge gas compressor 35 boosts the low pressure separator off-gas to
the suction pressure of the primary compressor 4 (operated at ethylene pipeline
pressure). At this point, part of the gas is purged from the EVA line to the monomer
recovery system, while the majority of this gas is recycled via the primary
compressor back to the reactor system.</p><p num="0060">The polymer melt from the low pressure separator 34 is fed to the hot melt
extruder 36. In the hot melt extruder additives are mixed in. This is typically done via
a sidearm extruder 38 utilizing the masterbatch technique. Note that the masterbatch
can contain additives such as slip, antiblock and antioxidant. Alternatively, liquid
additive injection can be considered.</p><p num="0061">The polymer strands leaving the die of the extruder are cut into pellets
underwater, and the pellets are cooled, dried at 40 and pneumatically transferred to
weigh-bins 42 or blenders 44, in which the pellets are purged to reduce the residual
ethylene concentration to a safe to store concentration (&lt; 50 wppm). After blending
the pellets are conveyed to bulk loading or bagging facilities 46.</p><p num="0062">To make the particular EVA's of the invention and those used in the
Examples, process conditions are adjusted to achieve a broad molecular weight
distribution with the appropriate amount of branching on the polymer while keeping
the melt index sufficiently low. The conversion is targeted to be high by using four or
more injection points for the initiator and injecting ethylene monomer with modifier
or transfer agent diluted in the monomer, upstream of the final initiator injection
point, at one or more locations. The depletion of the modifier permits extensive
branching in the final polymerization stages. This process can be operated to give the 
desired low MI and broad molecular weight distribution. Reactor pressures are
towards the low end of the range conventionally used (2200 to 2700 bar) while the
reactor temperatures lowers progressively along the length of the tube. The average
temperature is increased to above 220 °C, towards 300 °C at the upper end of the
conventional range (180 to 330 °C.), so as to favor formation of short chain branches
and maximize the long chain branching. The temperature is increased downstream of
the final injection point in comparison with conventional operating conditions to
increase long chain branching further. Propylene is used as the olefinic chain transfer
agent to increase the short chain branching of the polymer backbone further. The

and Mn were measured by GPC (Gel Permeation Chromatography) on a Waters 150
gel permeation chromatograph equipped with a differential refractive index (DRI)
detector and Chromatix KMX-6 on line light scattering photometer. The system was
used at 135°C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the mobile phase. Shodex (Showa
Denko America, Inc) polystyrene gel columns 802, 803, 804 and 805 were used.
This technique is discussed in "Liquid Chromatography of Polymers and Related
Materials III", J. Cazes, editor, Marcel Dekker. 1981, p. 207, which is incorporated
herein by reference. No corrections for column spreading were employed; however,
data on generally accepted standards, e.g. National Bureau of Standards Polyethylene 
1484 and anionically produced hydrogenated polyisoprenes (an alternating ethylenepropylene
copolymer) demonstrated that such corrections on Mw/Mn (=MWD) were
less than 0.05 units. Mw/Mn was calculated from elution times. The numerical
analyses were performed using the commercially available Beckman/CIS customised
LALLS software in conjunction with the standard Gel Permeation package.</p><p num="0069">The plastomer was made by the process generally described in

than the established ASTM methods indicated, are:
<sl><li>a) Holding Force/Elastic Recovery are determined by a method based on
an ASTM D5459 standard test method for elastic recovery, permanent deformation 
and stress retention of stretch film but modified in that the film sample is stretched to
a certain elongation (100 %) at a certain cross-head speed (1000 mm/min). When the
100 % elongation is reached, the cross-head is kept in this position for 5 sec and then
reversed to a certain 85 % elongation. The load on the sample is then measured after a
60 sec waiting time in (N/50 mm) and recorded as the holding force in the Table. This
mimics the holding force acting on the palletized load. Subsequently the cross-head is
returned to a position where the force reads zero. The elongation is recorded as the
elastic recovery in the Table. The normalized holding force is calculated by adjusting
the holding force according to the thickness of the film to a thickness of 100 µm N/50
mm (e.g. the measured value is doubled for a film with an initial thickness of 50 µm).</li><li>b) The Tear Propagation is measured based on ASTM 882 but modified
in that a film sample (50 * 50 mm) with a small pre-cut (2mm wide in MD) is
stretched in TD to 100 % elongation at 1000 mm/min cross head speed. To pass the
test the film should not tear uncontrolled but show an intermittent tear propagation
behavior, where the tearing is arrested and further force application is required to
restart it.</li><li>c) The puncture force is measured to determine the low speed puncture
properties of plastic film samples. The method aims to provide load versus
deformation response under multi-axial deformation conditions at a fixed relatively
low test speed (500 mm/min) to mimic the conditions under which the stretch hood
immobilizes a palletized load with sharp articles. In this test a piston with a standard
probe fixed to a load cell is pushed through a film sample in a circular sample holder
with a 90 mm diameter until the film punctures and breaks. The load is measured on
the load cell and the deformation is measured by the travel of the cross-head.</li></sl></p><p num="0079">To further illustrate the benefits provided by the Examples, reference is
made to the drawings and following discussion with reference to the drawings. </p><p num="0080">Figure 4 is a bar chart showing variation in holding force with heating
and cooling cycle temperature. The testing protocol (stretch hood relaxation test) for
assessing the effect of heating and cooling cycles was as follows:
<sl><li>The relaxation test was performed using a test jig equipped with two vertically spaced
horizontal bars. The upper bar is movable vertically to apply a predetermined
elongation to the film, which is attached to the bars in the form of a sleeve 50 mm
wide by 100 mm long. The lower bar is attached to a strain gauge to measure the
force acting on the film and the force is recorded using a data-logger. The test at
elevated temperature is performed by putting the whole test jig into a hot-air heated
oven at the desired temperature. To simulate the initial force acting on a shrink film,
the film is pre-tensioned to 3 % elongation which corresponds to the tension typically
found in commercially used pallet shrink film. The predetermined elongation applied
to the film as tested was developed by stretching by an initial 75 % and then allowing
the film to relax back to 60 %. The jig can be subjected to the desired heating and
cooling cycles to record the increase or decrease from the initial tension.</li></sl></p><p num="0081">The data, reflected in Figure 4, are in Table 10. Firstly with 150 micron
LDPE based shrink film shown at A, the holding force upon heating to 60 °C drops
drastically to a fraction of the initial holding force at room temperature. There is a
limited recovery upon cooling. At subsequent cycles the holding force deteriorates
further. All this necessitates the use of a thicker film than would otherwise be the
case. The film shown at B is a high EVA (18 wt % VA) with EXCEED surface layers
coextruded to a film of 80 microns thick. In this case after an initial drastic drop in
holding force upon heating to 60 °C, the holding force drops further upon subsequent
cooling to ambient temperature. The film has to be of sufficient thickness to
accommodate the loss in holding force. The film at C corresponds to film 5 in Table
12 but with a reduced thickness of 80 microns. In this case, the losses in holding force
are reduced over films A and B. However they are still significant. Film D is
according the invention and corresponds to film 1 in Table 12 but with a reduced 
thickness to 80 micron. In this case there is still a loss of holding force upon heating
to 60 °C. For a given thickness the film D provides a better holding force at 60 °C
than film C, which performance is maintained during subsequent heating and cooling
cycles, leading to a marked superiority after repeated heating and cooling cycles.

Table 12. As an indication of the weight saving in the hood which is available with
the invention, Film 1 according to the invention and Reference 1 can be compared. It
should be noted that at 100 % stretch, the tear propagation for Reference 1 is bad. In
practice that means that it can only be stretched to a level well below 100 % so as to
preserve package integrity in the event of a film puncture and subsequent tear
propagation. In turn the reduced degree of stretch for Reference 1 which is
compatible with package integrity means that the holding force for a given film
weight would be reduced. Thus a thicker film must be used. In addition the 
comparison shows that even ignoring the requirement for package integrity the film
according to the invention gives a higher holding force for the same film weight.</p><p num="0083">The Examples according to the invention have "intermittent tear"
characteristics in that after initial stretch, a puncture only spreads progressively stepwise
if the load is increased further. In intervening zones, tear propagation can be
arrested. As illustrated the intermittent tear zone starts after about 70 % stretch.
Reference 1 and 2 in Table 12 above suffer from progressive tear after about 60 %
stretch with no intervening tear-arresting plateau. Such highly stretched prior art
films, if punctured while containing a load, can tear catastrophically, spilling the load.
With the invention a higher degree of stretch can be safely applied.</p><p num="0084">Figure 7 is a graph showing the sensitivity of the coefficient of friction
with different compositions of the skin layers. With reference to Figures 7, it is
apparent that the coefficient of friction (COF) can be adapted to that required by
particular stretch hood packaging machines over a broad range of from 0.2 to 1.2,
spanning the preferred range of around 0.4 to 0.6, by the judicious combination of
anti-block and slip agent. The desired combination can be achieved by the use of a
mixture of existing metallocene derived LLDPE grades with inherently low blocking
characteristics. The performance is stabilized by the matching inclusion of such
additives that are migratable (such as the slip agent) in the core layer. Figure 7 also
shows that COF is substantially constant over a broad range of thicknesses, which
indicates the film to have very good machine performance. This has the added
advantage that the need to reformulate or to adjust the skin layer composition, for
different thicknesses, is reduced.</p><p num="0085">The data on the coefficient of friction as shown in Figure 7 were
developed by means of a designed experiment (4 factors, 3 levels) in which was
studied the effect on coefficient of friction of four parameters [(a) antiblock added in 
addition to the amount already present in the additivated polymer component of the
skin layer, (b) film thickness, (c) plastomer level in core layer and (d) amount of slip-
and antiblock- additivated Exceed-1018EB (as a percentage of total additivated and
unadditivated (Exceed 1018CA) polymer in the skin layer)]. The films to be tested
were produced by the method and equipment described with reference to Table 8 with
a layer distribution of A= 20 %, B= 60 %, C= 20 %. The coefficient of friction (COF)
was measured following ASTM D1894. A series of films to be tested was formed
used various combinations of the four parameters mentioned above, each parameter
being employed at three levels. These levels were: (a) 0, 2500, 5000 ppm, anti-block
(b) 80, 110, 140 micron, film thickness (c) 0, 37.5, 75 %, additivated Exceed EB (d)
0, 15, 30 % plastomer. The data were analyzed using a Design of Experiment
software package (DesignExpert). Figure 7 is a statistical model derived from the
results obtained in the designed experiments and represents films where the antiblock
level (a) is at 1250 ppm; and the plastomer level in the core layer (c) is zero. The
figure shows the kinetic COF performance of the films as parameters (b) and (c) are
varied.</p><p num="0086">The impact of higher stretch and thinner films, as well as better
preservation of the holding force as a result of temperature variations, can be
exploited to provide savings in amount of polymer consumed per palletized load in
excess of 50 % over prior art films for containing palletized loads. Wash boarding can
be minimized, especially if thicker films are desired by the use of an EVA with a low
VA content and high SCB content and/or the admixture of EXACT and/or the use of
an LLDPE containing LCB. Such steps render the tensile curve positive or less
negative over a greater degree of film stretch.</p><p num="0087">The benefits of the films of the invention and the optimized EVA
described herein can be exploited in wide variety of ways. While the invention has
been described against the background of stretch hood packaging requirements, the 
unique characteristics of the EVA may also be suitable for the modification of the
performance of shrink hood film or stretch wrap films as well as other film
applications. In the field of stretch hood packaging the improved characteristics may
be exploited to lower the cost of packaging by reducing the weight of films used by
employing thinner and/or more highly stretched films. The improved characteristics
may also be employed to strengthen the holding force, transparency etc. so as to
qualify stretch hood packaging films for more demanding applications where until
now their performance had not been sufficient.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>Polymer comprising units derived from ethylene, said polymer having:
