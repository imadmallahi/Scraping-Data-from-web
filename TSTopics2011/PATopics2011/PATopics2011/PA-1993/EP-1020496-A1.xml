5,466,807. Perylenes as initially isolated in the process of the present
invention, often referred to as crude perylenes, are generally unsuitable
for use as pigments and thus must be subjected to one or more additional
finishing steps that modify particle size, particle shape, and/or crystal
structure in such a way that provides good pigmentary quality. See, for
example, K. Merkle and H. Schäfer, "Surface Treatment of Organic
Pigments" in <u style="single">Pigment Handbook</u>, Vol. III (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons,
Inc., 1973), page 157; R.B. McKay, "The Development of Organic
Pigments with Particular Reference to Physical Form and Consequent
Behavior in Use" in <u style="single">Rev. Prog. Coloration</u>, <u style="single">10</u>, 25-32 (1979); and R.B.
McKay, "Control of the application performance of classical organic
pigments" in <u style="single">JOCCA</u>, 89-93 (1989).</p><p num="0002">The addition of certain perylene derivatives to the ring-closure step
has also been reported. For example, U.S. Patent 5,264,034 discloses the
use of certain perylene bis-imides or imide-anhydrides to improve the 
coloristic and rheological properties of perylene pigments. U.S. Patent
5,248,774 discloses certain zwitterionic perylene bis-imide derivatives for
use as colorants or as surface-modifying agents for known perylene
pigments. U.S. Patent 5,472,494 discloses the use of certain perylene
mono-imide derivatives to modify the properties of organic pigments.
These patents do not, however, disclose the non-pigmentary cyclic
anhydrides and imides of the present invention.</p><p num="0003">It has now been found that the presence of certain non-pigmentary
cyclic anhydrides and imides during the chemical synthesis of perylene
bis-imides provides perylene pigment compositions that have improved
transparency and color properties, even in the unfinished form that is
initially isolated, and that are especially suitable for use in metallic paints.</p><p num="0004">Non-pigmentary cyclic anhydrides and imides of the type used in
the present invention are known. E.g., U.S. Patent 4,992,204 and J.M.
Chapman, Jr. et al, <u style="single">J. Pharm. Sci.</u>, <u style="single">78</u>, 903-909 (1989). Such compounds
have not, however, been used in combination with organic pigments.</p><p num="0005">Non-pigmentary naphthalimide derivatives have been disclosed in a
journal article describing computer design of additives for improving the
pigment properties of Pigment Red 179, an N,N-disubstituted perylene
pigment. P. Erk et al, <u style="single">Eur. Coat J.</u>, <u style="single">10</u>, 906-910 (1997). The article
describes the naphthalimides as being poor growth inhibitors compared to
perylene derivatives and does not disclose their incorporation during
pigment synthesis. Furthermore, non-pigmentary cyclic anhydrides and
imides of the type used in the present invention are not disclosed.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0006">This invention relates to a process for preparing perylene pigment

perylene tetracarboxylic acids and/or esters, as well as salts thereof, in
which groups E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>, E<sup>3</sup>, and E<sup>4</sup> are independently OH or salt forms thereof
or C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkoxy (preferably tetracarboxylic acids or salts thereof in which
E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>, E<sup>3</sup>, and E<sup>4</sup> are identically OH or a corresponding salt form); bis-anhydrides
in which E<sup>1</sup> and E<sup>2</sup> together and E<sup>3</sup> and E<sup>4</sup> together are oxygen

are independently NH or substituted nitrogen atoms (preferably
symmetrical bis-imides in which both nitrogen atoms have the same
substituent). Preferred perylene tetracarboxylic compounds have no
aromatic ring substituents B (i.e., p is zero), but substituted perylene
tetracarboxylic compounds in which at least one of the eight substitutable
aromatic ring carbon atoms of the perylene moiety has at least one group
B (i.e., where p is not zero) are also suitable. Some of the perylene 
tetracarboxylic compounds used as component (a) can themselves be
pigments but it is not necessary for the compounds to be pigments as long
as the ultimate perylene pigment composition is pigmentary.</p> <p num="0010">When used to describe the perylene tetracarboxylic compounds of
component (a), the term "C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkyl" refers to straight or branched chain
aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples
of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkyl are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and the
isomeric forms thereof. The term "C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>8</sub> cycloalkyl" refers to cycloaliphatic
hydrocarbon groups having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>8</sub>
cycloalkyl are cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl. The
term "C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> aryl" refers to phenyl and 1- or 2-naphthyl. The term "C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>16</sub>
aralkyl" refers to C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkyl substituted with C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> aryl such that the total
number of carbon atoms is from 7 to 16. Examples of C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>16</sub> aralkyl are
benzyl, phenethyl, and naphthylmethyl. Substituted alkyl groups are those
in which one or more carbon atoms are substituted with alkoxy, halogen,
hydroxy (including tautomeric oxo forms), alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl,
cyano, and nitro as defined herein. Substituted aryl and aralkyl groups are
those in which one or more carbon atoms are substituted with alkyl,
alkoxy, halogen, hydroxy (including tautomeric oxo forms), alkoxycarbonyl,
aryloxycarbonyl, cyano, and nitro as defined herein. The term "C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>
alkoxy" refers to straight or branched chain alkyl oxy groups having from I
to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkoxy are methoxy, ethoxy,
propoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, hexyloxy, and the isomeric forms thereof. The
term "sulfonyl group" refers to -SO<sub>2</sub>-R<sup>i</sup> groups, such as alkylsulfonyl (in
which R<sup>i</sup> is alkyl; for example, methylsulfonyl or ethanesulfonyl), arylsulfonyl
(in which R<sup>i</sup> is aryl; for example, phenylsulfonyl, 1- or 2-naphthyl-sulfonyl,
and substituted forms such as toluenesulfonyl), sulfoxyl and
corresponding esters (in which R<sup>i</sup> is OH, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aralkoxy, 
aryloxy), and sulfonamides (in which R<sup>i</sup> is -NR<sup>ii</sup>R<sup>iii</sup>, wherein R<sup>ii</sup> and R<sup>iii</sup> are
independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, or aryl). The terms
"amino" and "ammonium" refer respectively to -NR<sup>iv</sup>R<sup>v</sup> and -NR<sup>iv</sup>R<sup>v</sup>R<sup>vi+</sup> in
which R<sup>iv</sup>, R<sup>v</sup>, and R<sup>vi</sup> are independently hydrogen, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkyl, or C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>16</sub>
aralkyl and each ammonium group is electrically balanced with a
stoichiometric amount of an anion. The term "halogen" includes fluorine,
chlorine, bromine, and iodine.</p> <p num="0011">It is possible to use salt forms of the perylene tetracarboxylic
compounds if at least one of groups E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>, E<sup>3</sup>, and E<sup>4</sup> of formula (II)
represents a carboxylate anion or an imide form. Suitable carboxylic salts
are those in which each anionic carboxylate anion is electrically balanced
with a 1/n molar equivalents of an n-valent cation M<sup>n+</sup> (such as Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>,
Mg<sup>++</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>, Ba<sup>++</sup>, Al<sup>+++</sup>, Fe<sup>++</sup>, or Fe<sup>+++</sup>) or an ammonium ion having the
formula R<sup>I</sup>R<sup>II</sup>R<sup>III</sup>R<sup>IV</sup>N<sup>+</sup> (wherein R<sup>I</sup>, R<sup>II</sup>, R<sup>III</sup>, and R<sup>IV</sup> are independently
hydrogen, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkyl, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> hydroxyalkyl, or C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>16</sub> aralkyl). In general,
free acids in which at least one of E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>, E<sup>3</sup>, and E<sup>4</sup> is OH are initially
added to the reaction mixture but are converted to corresponding amine
salts by an in situ acid-base reaction with the ammonia or primary amine
of component (c). Suitable imide salts of formula (II) are perylenes in
which at least one of A<sup>1</sup> or A<sup>2</sup> represents 1/n molar equivalents of an
n-valent cation M<sup>n+</sup> (such as Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>++</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>, Ba<sup>++</sup>, Al<sup>+++</sup>, Fe<sup>++</sup>, or
Fe<sup>+++</sup>). Such salts are formed whenever imides of formula (II) in which A<sup>1</sup>
and/or A<sup>2</sup> is hydrogen are exposed to strongly basic media, either during
the reaction conditions used to prepare the perylene imide or by addition
of a strong base.</p> <p num="0012">The perylene tetracarboxylic compounds described above, some of
which are crude or conditioned perylene pigments and some of which are
precursors of perylene pigment, can be prepared by any of various
methods known in the art. E.g., W. Herbst and K. Hunger, <u style="single">Industrial
Organic Pigments</u>, 2nd ed. (New York: VCH Publishers, Inc., 1997), pages 
476-479; H. Zollinger, <u style="single">Color Chemistry</u> (VCH Verlagsgessellschaft, 1991),
pages 227-228; M.A. Perkins, "Pyridines and Pyridones" in <u style="single">The Chemistry

"Perylenes" in <u style="single">Pigment Handbook</u>, 2nd edition, Vol. III (New York: John
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1988), pages 653-658.</p><p num="0013">A critical feature of the invention is the use of non-pigmentary cyclic
anhydrides or imides of formula (I). The term "non-pigmentary" means that
the compounds are substantially colorless or are significantly less highly
colored and lack good pigmentary properties in comparison to the
perylene tetracarboxylic compounds and perylene pigment compositions
with which they are used. That is, suitable cyclic anhydrides or imides of
formula (I) would not themselves have practical utility as pigments. The
term "substantially colorless" does not mean that the cyclic anhydrides or
imides must be absolutely devoid of color in the visible region but instead
means only that the compounds are insignificantly colored in comparison
to the perylene pigments with which they are used. For example, preferred
cyclic anhydrides or imides of formula (I) will exhibit molar absorptivities

and C.H. Heathcock, <u style="single">Introduction to Organic Chemistry</u>, 3rd. edition (New
York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1985), pages 495 and 866.</p><p num="0018">Imides of formula (I) (where W is NR<sup>1</sup>) can in turn be prepared from
corresponding acids, esters, or anhydrides by known methods, preferably
by reaction of a corresponding cyclic anhydride with at least a slight molar
excess of a suitable amine in a suitable solvent. In a preferred method for
preparing imides in which R<sup>1</sup> contains no ionic groups, the anhydride and
amine react in water heated at about 80°C to 100°C at ambient pressure 
or at temperatures of up to about 140°C in an autoclave or other sealed
reactor, typically for about two to four hours. In a preferred method for
preparing imides in which R<sup>1</sup> contains anionic groups (e.g., carboxylate,
sulfonate, or phosphonate groups), the protonated amino group of the
zwitterionic amine precursor is converted into a free amino group by
adding an equivalent of a base (such as sodium or potassium hydroxide)
to the reaction mixture, after which the reaction is carried out under
essentially the same conditions as used for nonionic compounds.
However, if the resultant anionic compound is water-soluble, it must be
isolated, for example, by acidifying the reaction mixture and isolating the
free acid, by increasing the ionic strength of the mixture and isolating the
otherwise soluble metal salt (i.e., sodium or potassium), or by precipitating
the imide by adding a polyvalent metal salt (e.g., CaCl<sub>2</sub>, BaCl<sub>2</sub>, or FeCl<sub>2</sub>).</p><p num="0019">Imide salts of formula (I) in which W is NR<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>1</sup> is a metal can be
prepared from corresponding "free" imides in which R<sup>1</sup> is hydrogen.
Suitable imide salts of formula (I) are those in which each R<sup>1</sup> represents
1/n molar equivalents of an n-valent cation M<sup>n+</sup> (such as Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>++</sup>,
Ca<sup>++</sup>, Ba<sup>++</sup>, Al<sup>+++</sup>, Fe<sup>++</sup>, or Fe<sup>+++</sup>). Such salts are formed whenever imides of
formula (I) in which R<sup>1</sup> is hydrogen are exposed to strongly basic media,
either during the reaction conditions used to prepare the perylene imide or
by addition of a strong base to the free imide.</p><p num="0020">Component (c) includes ammonia and primary amines having the
formula R<sup>A</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub> in which R<sup>A</sup> is C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkyl, C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>16</sub> aralkyl, or C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> aryl.
Examples of suitable primary amines include alkylamines such as methyl
amine, ethyl amine, propyl amine, butyl amine, pentyl amine, hexyl amine,
and isomeric forms thereof; aralkylamines such as benzylamine and
phenethylamine; and arylamines such as aniline, anisidine, phenetidine,
toluidine, and various xylidine isomers. It is necessary to use at least a
slight excess of ammonia or amine (c) relative to the anhydride and/or
imide groups of perylene pigment precursor (a) and non-pigmentary cyclic 
anhydride or imide (b). In general, about 1.1 to about 10 moles (preferably
1.5 to 5 moles) of ammonia or primary amine (c) is used per mole of the
anhydride and imide groups of components (a) and (b). Although generally
not preferred, it is possible to use larger quantities of ammonia or primary
amine (c), which, if liquid under the reaction conditions, can even serve as
solvent or as co-solvent with component (d).</p><p num="0021">Suitable solvents (d) are liquids that are capable of dissolving or
suspending the components of the reaction mixture without significantly
decomposing or otherwise reacting during the reaction. Examples of
suitable solvents include water; monofunctional alcohols, particularly lower
alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, and
isomeric forms thereof; amides such as dimethylformamide and
dimethylacetamide; ketones and ketone alcohols such as acetone and
diacetone alcohol; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; alkylene
glycols and thioglycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene
glycol, triethylene glycol, hexylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and
thiodiglycol; polyalkylene glycols, such as polyethylene glycol and
polypropylene glycol; other polyols, such as glycerol and 1,2,6-hexanetriol;
lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, such as 2-methoxyethanol, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol,
2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol, and 2-[2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol;
aromatic and heteroaromatic liquids,
such as benzene, pyridine, and quinoline; and other such organic liquids
known in the art. Water, methanol, and quinoline are particularly preferred
solvents. Other solvents can, of course, also often be used, but it is
generally advisable to avoid solvents that can react with the reactive
components. The quantity of solvent is generally not critical but should be
an amount sufficient to dissolve or suspend the components of the
reaction mixture but not so large as to require removal of excessive
amounts after the reaction is complete. Typical quantities of solvent range 
from about 5 to about 20 parts by weight (preferably 7 to 15 parts by
weight) relative to the total amount of components (a) and (b).</p><p num="0022">Solvents (d) may not be necessary if one or more of components
(a), (b), or (c) are themselves liquids or if the mixture of components (a),
(b), and (c) can be melted without significant decomposition to undesired
by-products.</p><p num="0023">The optional additives (e) can be any of the customary pigment
preparation additives known in the art that serve, for example, to improve
color properties, lessen or avoid flocculation, increase pigment dispersion
stability, and reduce coating viscosity. Suitable additives include, for
example, dispersants or surfactants and various pigment derivatives.
Examples of suitable dispersants include anionic compounds, such as
fatty acids (such as stearic or oleic acid), fatty acid salts (i.e., soaps such
as alkali metal salts of fatty acids), fatty acid taurides or N-methytaurides,
alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkylnaphthalenesulfonates, alkylphenol
polyglycol ether sulfates, naphthenic acids or resin acids (such as abietic
acid); cationic compounds, such as quaternary ammonium salts, fatty
amines, fatty amine ethylates, and fatty amine polyglycol ethers; and
nonionic compounds, such as fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol
polyglycol esters, and alkylphenol polyglycol ethers. Examples of suitable
pigment additives include organic pigments having one or more sulfonic
acid groups, sulfonamide groups, carboxylic acid, carboxamide, and/or
(hetero)aryl-containing (cyclo)aliphatic groups. Such additives can be
incorporated in amounts ranging from about 0.05 to 20% by weight
(preferably 1 to 10% by weight), based on the amount of pigment.</p><p num="0024">The perylene pigment compositions of the present invention can be
prepared by mixing components (a), (b), and (c), and optional components
(d) and (e) in essentially any sequence. Preferably, however, perylene
tetracarboxylic compound (a) and non-pigmentary cyclic anhydride or
imide (b), as well as any dispersant (e), are added to solvent (d) and 
stirred at a temperature of about 0°C to about 30°C (preferably at or below
room temperature, more preferably 0°C to 5°C) before adding ammonia or
amine (c). After component (c) is added, the mixture is heated at a
temperature of about 50°C to about 150°C (preferably 80°C to 100°C) until
reaction is complete, typically a period of about two to six hours. For
example, in particularly preferred embodiments in which component (c) is
methylamine, a mixture of the perylene tetracarboxylic compound and the
non-pigmentary cyclic anhydride or imide in water is cooled to about 5°C
and then heated with methylamine. Upon completion of the reaction, the
reaction mixture is cooled if necessary and the pigment is collected, for
example, by filtration, centrifugation, or other known methods.</p><p num="0025">During the process of the present invention, the ammonia or amine
of component (c) may react with acid anhydrides and/or imides that are
present in compounds of formulas (I) and/or (II) to form corresponding
imides in which at least some of groups R<sup>1</sup>, A<sup>1</sup>, and/or A<sup>2</sup> are replaced with
hydrogen (from ammonia) or group R<sup>A</sup> (from amine R<sup>A</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub>). However,
regardless of whether the starting perylene tetracarboxylic compounds
and non-pigmentary cyclic anhydrides or imides are transformed by
component (c), the resultant perylene pigment compositions exhibit
improved transparency and color properties when compared to perylene
pigments prepared in the absence of the non-pigmentary cyclic anhydride
or imide.</p><p num="0026">The pigment composition can optionally be conditioned using
methods known in the art, such as solvent treatment or milling in
combination with solvent treatment. Final particle size of the pigment can
be controlled by varying the method of aftertreatment. For example,
pigments can be made more transparent by reducing the particle size or
more opaque by increasing the particle size. Suitable milling methods
include dry-milling methods such as jet milling, ball milling, and the like,
with or without additives, or wet-milling methods such as salt kneading, 
sand milling, bead milling, and the like in water or organic solvents, with or
without additives.</p><p num="0027">During or after the optional conditioning step, it is often desirable to
use various other optional ingredients that provide improved properties.
Examples of such optional ingredients include fatty acids having at least
12 carbon atoms, such as stearic acid or behenic acid, or corresponding
amides, esters, or salts, such as magnesium stearate, zinc stearate,
aluminum stearate, or magnesium behenate; quaternary ammonium
compounds, such as tri[(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkyl)benzyl]ammonium salts; plasticizers,
such as epoxidized soya bean oil; waxes, such as polyethylene wax; resin
acids, such as abietic acid, rosin soap, hydrogenated or dimerized rosin;
C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>-paraffin-disulfonic acids; alkylphenols; alcohols, such as stearyl
alcohol; amines, such as laurylamine or stearylamine; and aliphatic 1,2-diols,
such as dodecane-1,2-diol. Such additives can be incorporated in
amounts ranging from about 0.05 to 20% by weight (preferably 1 to 10%
by weight), based on the amount of pigment. The pigment compositions
can also be blended (preferably by dry blending) with one or more pigment
derivatives known in the art, particularly sulfonic acid, sulfonamide, and
phthalimide derivatives.</p><p num="0028">Because of their light stability and migration properties, the
perylene pigment compositions according to the present invention are
suitable for many different pigment applications. For example, pigment
compositions according to the invention can be used as the colorant (or as
one of two or more colorants) for very lightfast pigmented systems.
Examples include pigmented mixtures with other materials, pigment
formulations, paints, printing ink, colored paper, or colored macro-molecular
materials. The term "mixtures with other materials" is
understood to include, for example, mixtures with inorganic white
pigments, such as titanium dioxide (rutile) or cement, or other inorganic 
pigments. Examples of pigment formulations include flushed pastes with
organic liquids or pastes and dispersions with water, dispersants, and, if
appropriate, preservatives. Examples of paints in which pigments of this
invention can be used include, for example, physically or oxidatively drying
lacquers, stoving enamels, reactive paints, two-component paints, solvent-or
water-based paints, emulsion paints for weatherproof coatings, and
distempers. Printing inks include those known for use in paper, textile, and
tinplate printing. Suitable macromolecular substances include those of a
natural origin, such as rubber; those obtained by chemical modification,
such as acetyl cellulose, cellulose butyrate, or viscose; or those produced
synthetically, such as polymers, polyaddition products, and polycondensates.
Examples of synthetically produced macromolecular
substances include plastic materials, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl
acetate, and polyvinyl propionate; polyolefins, such as polyethylene and
polypropylene; high molecular weight polyamides; polymers and
copolymers of acrylates, methacrylates, acrylonitrile, acrylamide,
butadiene, or styrene; polyurethanes; and polycarbonates. The materials
pigmented with the perylene pigment compositions of the present
invention can have any desired shape or form. The pigment compositions
according to this invention are highly water-resistant, oil-resistant, acid-resistant,
lime-resistant, alkali-resistant, solvent-resistant, fast to over-lacquering,
fast to over-spraying, fast to sublimation, heat-resistant, and
resistant to vulcanizing, yet give a very good tinctorial yield and are readily
dispersible (for example, in plastic materials).</p><p num="0029">The following examples further illustrate details for the process of
