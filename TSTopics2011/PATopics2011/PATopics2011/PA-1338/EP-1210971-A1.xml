incorporate selected gas selective species as surface
sites in a controlled spacing and orientation manner

separating and purifying the selected gas from selected
gas containtig gas mixtures. An example is the use of
oxygen selective transition element complexes (TECs) as

microporous membranes that incorporate selected gas
selective sites. Examples of selected gas selective
sites include selective transition element complexes
(TEC's) for oxygen, amines and/or exposed cations for
carbon dioxide, and copper(I) and/or silver(I) sites
for carbon monoxide. The selected gas selective sites
are incorporated onto internal surfaces of porous
membranes in a controlled spacing and orientation
manner and such resulting microporous membranes being
suitable for separating and purifying selected gas from
the selected gas containing gas mixtures. The
invention also relates to the microporous selective
membranes so made.</p><heading><u style="single">Description of the Prior Art</u></heading><p num="0002">For many years, air has been separated and
purified by cryogenic distillation, for which operating
temperatures are set by the vapor-liquid equilibria of
the liquefied mixture. Cryogenic separation is capital
intensive, particularly for production rates below
several hundred tons per day. Alternative technologies
compete in the marketplace particularly for air
separations to produce oxygen and nitrogen at lower
purities and lower production rates than cryogenic
systems. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) has been 
applied to air separation and purification at near
ambient temperature using either gas-solid equilibria
or differences in uptake and release rates between
adsorbates for a given adsorbent. Gas separation using
membrane systems takes advantage of differences in
permeation rates for the different feed components.
Process aspects of membrane gas separation are simpler
than either cryogenic or PSA systems.</p><p num="0003">Conventional air separation using membrane systems
employs thin polymeric coatings which exhibit
permselectivity for one or more components of the feed.
For air separation, the primary concern is the
separation of oxygen and nitrogen with the selectivity
for other feed components such as water and carbon
dioxide playing a lesser role. Advances in membrane
materials have relied on the identification and
utilization of polymers showing increased selectivity
and permeability, combined with improvements in coating
technology to give thinner separation layers.</p><p num="0004">Certain transition element complexes possess sites
which show high selectivities for oxygen over nitrogen,
argon, and other air components. Several attempts have
been made to incorporate oxygen selective TEC sites
into membrane systems to give rise to facilitated
oxygen transport. Alternative approaches have been
utilized such as those which are supported liquid
membranes where the TEC sites function as mobile
carriers or dense polymer membranes or microporous
membranes where the TEC's serve as fixed sites. For
example, a membrane containing Co(3-MeOsaltmen) in γ-butyrolactone
containing 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine 
(DMAP) at -10°C showed a selectivity α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) &gt;20 with
an oxygen permeability of 260 Barrer. Several problems
have been identified which restrict or limit the
application of supported liquid membranes to air
separation. These include practical restrictions such
as solubility limits for the TEC, membrane thickness,
and low carrier mobility. In addition, decline in
membrane performance can occur by irreversible TEC
oxidation, evaporation loss of the liquid medium, and
contamination of the liquid membrane with minor
atmospheric components.</p><p num="0005">Permeation within polymeric materials can be
described by a combination of diffusional and
solubility effects. The incorporation of TEC's into
polymeric substrates has been disclosed to improve
oxygen transport through solubility enhancement.
Several alternative configurations have been examined
such as examples where the TEC/axial base is physically
incorporated in the polymer, or where the TEC and/or
axial donor are covalently linked to the polymer.</p><p num="0006">Permeation studies for dense polymer membranes
containing TEC's have indicated that the increasing
oxygen permeability with decreasing upstream oxygen
pressure is consistent with facilitation. For example,
permeation studies at 35°C for polybutylmethacrylate
containing 4.5 wt.% 1-Melm/Co(T<sub>piv</sub>PP), where 1-Melm
refers to 1-methylimidazole and Co(T<sub>piv</sub>PP) refers to
meso-tetra(α,α,α,α-o-privalamidophenyl)porphyrinato-cobalt(II),
indicated a P(O<sub>2</sub>) of 23 Barrer with
selectivity α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 12 at 5 mmHg upstream pressure
and lifetimes on the order of months. </p><p num="0007">Oxygen facilitation in styrene-butadiene-vinylpyridine
graft copolymers, and epoxidized styrenebutadiene
block copolymers containing TEC's have been
disclosed in the prior art. Pressure dependent oxygen
permeation with α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) up to 6.2 and P(O<sub>2</sub>) 29.4 Barrer
with an upstream pressure of 50 mmHg have been
reported. Permeation studies for
polyhexylmethacrylate-co-vinylpyridine containing N,N<sup>1</sup>-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediaminocobalt(II)
(abbreviated
as Co(salen)) prepared by an interfacial reaction
between a polymer solution and a TEC impregnated in a
porous membrane have been reported. Selectivities over
20 were reported with an oxygen permeation rate of
3.12x10<sup>-8</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>/s cmHg at 100 torr upstream pressure.
In an alternative approach, a rigid porous support for
butylacrylate-co-vinylimidazole membranes containing
Co(T<sub>piv</sub>PP) have provided permeation measurements
indicating α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 16.</p><p num="0008">Gas separation membranes consisting of TEC's
related to Co(salen) and DMAP physically incorporated
in polysulfone which exhibit facilitated oxygen
transport have been disclosed. A dry/wet phase
inversion process was utilized to give thin separation
layers and to prevent TEC crystallization. The
stability of the separation membranes have been found
to be satisfactory over 3 months using either a
synthetic air or a compressed air feed. The highest
selectivity reported corresponds to asymmetric
membranes containing 15.1 wt.% Co(5-NO<sub>2</sub>-salen) which
gives α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 23.46. </p><p num="0009">Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes have been
prepared by controlled carbonization of polymeric
substrates, and permit gas separations on the basis of
molecular dimensions. For the separation of components
with similar kinetic diameters such as oxygen and
nitrogen, fine control of the pore size distribution of
the CMS membranes is generally required.</p><p num="0010">There are several examples of microporous
membranes where surface diffusion plays a significant
role in transport including the transport of organic
vapor mixtures through porous glass, and gas permeation
for porous glass modified using tetraethoxysilane. The
transport of pure gases and binary gas mixtures through
microporous composite membranes based on alumina have
shown surface diffusion of carbon dioxide with a
surface diffusion coefficient estimated to lie in the
range 2 X 10<sup>-5</sup> to 5 X 10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/sec.</p><p num="0011">U.S. Patent 5,104,425 describes porous membranes
incorporating a porous adsorbent which separate gas
mixtures by virtue of the selective adsorption of at
least one primary component. The adsorbed component
diffuses by surface flow in the adsorbed phase due to
concentration gradients created by a pressure
difference across the membrane. Pore diameters, for
the substrate described in the patent should like
between 0.1 and 50µm, and the thickness of the active
layer containing porous adsorptive material should be
&lt;20µm. The incorporation of porous adsorbent coatings
involves introduction of an adsorbent precursor,
heating to convert the precursor to the porous
adsorbent, and cooling. Methods for the modification 
of the porosity of the adsorptive layer are disclosed,
together with post-treatments for the sealing of
defects using a thin layer (&lt;1µm) of high permeability,
low selectivity polymer such as a silicon containing
polymer. Permeation measurements, for example of an
adsorbent membrane at 25°C indicate α(CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>) of 7.1 and
a CO<sub>2</sub> permeability of 3360 Barrer.</p><p num="0012">Oxygen separating porous membranes have been
disclosed in the prior art where oxygen-selective TEC's
are retained in the pores of a porous substrate to give
membranes with free pore diameters from 3.5 to 100Å.
An additional donor required to provide five-coordinate
deoxy TEC sites is provided by aromatic heterocycles
either from copolymers of vinyl aromatic heterocycles
and alkyl-acrylates or -methacrylates, or from low
molecular weight aromatic heterocycles. High oxygen
selectivities were reported due to rapid adsorption and
desorption of oxygen at TEC sites resulting in oxygen
surface flow. For example, mixed gas permeation
measurements using 2.6% oxygen in nitrogen as feed for
a membrane consisting of Co(T<sub>piv</sub>PP) and poly(N-vinylimidazole-co-octyl
methacrylate) (POMIm) supported
in Vycor 7930 porous glass, indicate an α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) 7,
with P(O<sub>2</sub>) 41,000 Barrer.</p><p num="0013">Although supported liquid membranes containing
TEC's as mobile carriers have shown promising
permeation characteristics on a laboratory scale, they
are not useful for practical gas separation. Several
concerns have been identified for these systems. These
include practical restrictions such as solubility
limits for the TEC, membrane thickness, and low carrier 
mobility. In addition, decline in membrane performance
has been observed due to irreversible TEC oxidation,
evaporation loss of the liquid medium, and
contamination of the liquid membrane with minor
atmospheric components. The microporous oxygen
selective membranes described in the subject invention
are solid systems which avoids solubility, mobility,
and stability concerns.</p><p num="0014">The application of dense polymer membranes
containing TEC's for gas separation are disclosed in
the prior art. As in the case of simple polymer
membranes, the membranes can incorporate TEC's which
separates gases on the basis of differential solubility
and diffusivity of gases within the material. Although
promising permeation characteristics (oxygen
selectivity and permeability) has been reported,
membranes containing TEC's have not been applied to
commercial separations due to a number of factors. The
ability to produce thin polymer films containing TEC's
which are mechanically stable and which contain low
defects has not been demonstrated. For example, high
TEC contents have been found to result in more brittle
materials. In addition, current methods used to
produce polymer membranes containing TEC's for gas
separation do not adequately control TEC spacing to
prevent unfavorable processes including bimolecular
decomposition pathways which are known to occur in
liquids.</p><p num="0015">Liquid membranes containing TEC's have shown
interesting properties but have not proven useful for
air separation due to irreversible TEC oxidation,
evaporation loss of the liquid medium, and 
contamination of the liquid membrane with minor
atmospheric components.</p><p num="0016">United States Patent No. 5,411,580 discloses an
oxygen-separating porous membrane comprising a complex
of (a) a transition metal (II) ion, (b) a ligand, and
(c) an aromatic heterocycle, retained in the pores of a

improvements in the art are needed to enable membrane

the average surface area required for each selected gas
(adsorbate) molecule. Knowing the footprint area, the
spacing between adsorption sites or regions can be
obtained. The term "site footprint" is used to
represent the area occupied by individual selective 
sites. A limiting case occurs for close-packed
arrangements of sites where the site footprint
corresponds to the maximum cross-section in a plane
parallel to the support and is equivalent to the
footprint (average surface area required for each
selected gas molecule). However, examples are also
considered where the sites are not close-packed and the
footprint corresponds to an average area occupied by
individual sites. For selected gas selective site
coatings, the footprints used represent average surface
areas occupied by adsorbates in monolayer coatings
based on adsorption measurements. For some
embodiments, selected gas selective sites may be part
of a larger molecule, particularly for amplifying
linking agents. In this case, the term footprint
represents the average area occupied by adsorbate, and
the value may be smaller than the molecular footprint.</p><p num="0032">The substrate utilized for the formation of
microporous selected gas selective membranes is used to
provide structural integrity, a surface for the
deployment of selective groups, and may also serve as a
heat sink to dissipate heat associated with adsorption
and transport processes. The substrate should be
available in membrane form (flat sheet, tubes, hollow
fibers) and possess porosity throughout the cross-section.
The separation region itself in microporous
selected gas selective membranes may be present only in
regions of the substrate. The substrate should be
chemically inert with respect to site degradation in
either bound or unbound states.</p><p num="0033">Control of the free pore diameter and pore size
distribution in modified substrates (i.e. after 
incorporation of selective sites) is required to
prevent dominant transport by non-selective or weakly
selective pathways. Mean pore diameters for the coated
substrate below 25Å are preferred combined with narrow
pore size distributions. The preparation of
microporous selected gas selective membranes using
preformed substrates requires a mean pore size and pore
size distribution amenable to the transport of selected
gas selective sites (such as TEC's for oxygen) to
interior regions. For polymeric substrates, swelling
agents can be utilized to facilitate transport of the
selective sites to interior regions. Suitable swelling
agents can be selected from the group comprising
alcohols, hydrocarbons, and dipolar aprotic solvents
such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).</p><p num="0034">The surface characteristics of a support that can
be used to assist in the organization of selective
sites, are linking agents which can give close-packed
oriented monolayer coatings. The term "linking agent"
is used here to describe molecular species containing
at least two functional sites which are designed or
selected to serve as an interface between selective
sites and the surface of a substrate. For example,
diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is viewed as a linking agent
since it can interact simultaneously with an acidic
surface and a four-coordinate deoxy TEC.</p><p num="0035">Examples of typical preformed membrane substrates
for the preparation of microporous oxygen selective
membranes include porous glasses (sol-gel or acid-leached),
zeolite membranes, anodized alumina
membranes, and porous carbons. Porous polymeric
compositions may also serve as useful substrates and 
examples include crosslinked polymers and copolymers,
phase separated polymers and porous condensation
polymers such as polyamides and polyimides. For
polymeric substrates the TEC sites are located on pore
walls and the requirements for free pore diameter and
pore size distribution are the same as for inorganic
substrates. However, gas diffusion through dense
polymer regions would be slow. Porous polymers and
copolymers containing potential axial donors (e.g.
polyvilyhpyridine type or polyvinylimidazole type) or
groups which incorporate or are easily modified to
provide potential axial donors can be used.</p><p num="0036">Various substrate configurations are suitable
including flat disk, tube, spiral wound, and hollow
fiber. The selection of substrate configuration will
depend on the particular application and fabrication
concerns. Pretreatment of the substrate may be
necessary to remove water or other adsorbed species
using methods appropriate to the substrate and the
adsorbate. Examples of absorbed species are water,
alcohols, porogens, and surfactant templates.</p><p num="0037">The nature of the selective sites chosen will
depend on the identity of the selected gas. This is
illustrated for examples where the selected gas is
oxygen. Certain transition element complexes (TEC's)
have been shown to interact exclusively with oxygen
over nitrogen and argon, and CO<sub>2</sub> based on solution or
solid state studies. These oxygen selective TEC's
preferably provide the preferred embodiment for the
oxygen surface transport and selectivity in microporous
oxygen selective membranes of the subject invention.
The solid state deployment of TEC's results in two 
advantages over TEC's in the liquid phase. First,
immobilization and spacing of TEC's in the solid state
avoid deactivating reactions, such as bimolecular
oxidations, which occur readily in solution. Secondly,
solid state deployment circumvents conflicting
compromises that must be made in choosing a solvent
such as high TEC solubility, low solvent vapor
pressure, low viscosity, and safety concerns associated
with use at relatively high oxygen concentrations.</p><p num="0038">The transition element complexes (TEC's) preferred
for the subject invention for oxygen are the transition
element complexes which have selective interactions
with molecular oxygen involving reversible
chemisorption. A general representation of a suitable
TEC based on a tetradentate and a monodentate donor to
cobalt(II) is shown in Figure 1. Two components are
required for a TEC to function as an O<sub>2</sub>-selective
compound: (1) a transition metal ion, (2) a
polydentate ligand which chelates the transition metal
ion. Additional donors may also be required to provide
a five-coordinate deoxy transition metal ion which is
preferred for oxygen interaction in a superoxo mode.
Examples of useful TEC composition classes include
five-coordinate complexes containing cobalt or iron
ions embedded in tetradentate Schiff bases or
porphyrins to which are attached axial bases such as
derivatives of imidazole or pyridine. Suitable
combinations for use in the subject invention contain
the following components: (1) metal ions: cobalt(II),
iron(II), copper(I), and mixtures thereof, (2) ligands:
porphyrins, Schiff bases, polyamines, polyoxoamides,
oximes and their derivatives, and cyclidenes, and (3) 
axial bases: nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, heterocycles,
thioethers, pyridine, imidazole, amines, epoxides,
ethers and their derivatives, Preferred embodiments
include appropriate combinations of the following: (1)
cobalt(II) and the metal ion, (2) picket-fence
porphyrin and related porphyrin dianions as ligands,
low molecular weight ligands such as salen and related
Schiff bases, and tetraazaannulene ligands, and (3)
axial bases of N-substituted imidazoles and 3- and/or
4-substituted pyridines as axial bases, and tertiary
amines.</p><p num="0039">When the selected gas is carbon dioxide, selective
sites include amines (primary, secondary, and
tertiary), and exposed cations. When the selected gas
is carbon monoxide or an olefin, selective sites
include copper(I) and silver(I) either adsorbed on
surfaces, or present in a chelating ligand.</p><p num="0040">A function of the selected gas selective sites in
microporous selected gas selective membranes is to
provide equilibrium selectivity for active surface
transport of the selected gas. This is illustrated for
a microporous oxygen selective membrane involving
active surface transport of oxygen. Simulations using
a conduit pore model have indicated that the oxygen
equilibrium coefficient of TEC sites, and the TEC site
footprint represent important TEC selection parameters.
The desired performance of a given membrane will rely
on matching the structure and composition of the TEC
and its associated axial base with the oxygen
concentration and pressure of the feed, and with the
provision of rapid surface transport rates. The
intrinsic reaction rates for oxygen at the TEC sites 
are generally very fast, based on evidence from laser
flash photolysis spectroscopy and from reactions in
solution.</p><p num="0041">Preferably, the selected gas selective sites are
deployed so that the sites are distributed essentially
as monolayers attached to either concave or convex
internal surfaces of microporous membrane surfaces. A
novel feature of the subject invention is the linking
agents to attach the selected gas selective sites to
support surfaces as monolayer coatings which are
oriented with respect to the surface.</p><p num="0042">A preferred embodiment of the subject invention is
the use of linking agents (if required) to control the
selected gas selective site concentration and spacing,
and to orient the selective sites with respect to the
surface of the substrate. The term "linking agent" is
used to describe molecular species containing at least
two functional sites which are designed or selected to
serve as the selective sites or as an interface between
selective sites and the surface of a substrate. Two
advantages over earlier methods for deploying selected
gas selective sites are (1) one method that yields
selected gas selective site distributions that are more
uniformly spaced at distances that correspond to high
surface coverage and (2) another method that provides
for ready access of selected gas to the selective
sites. These advantages derive from the chemical
structure of linking agents. The linking agent can be
a separate species, part of the selected gas selective
site, or part of the support particle, as in the case
of an organic polymer support. The linking agent can
be attached to the support by means of various 
interactions, including covalent bonds and acid-base
interactions. Selected gas selective sites may be
attached to the linking agents in several ways. For
example, a particularly efficient way to attach TEC's
that infer oxygen selectivity to a substrate is through
the axial base. For this mode of attachment of oxygen
selective sites, the best configuration of TEC's in a
supported monolayer that is a dense side-by-side array
of TEC's oriented with the axis defined by the O<sub>2</sub>-metal-axial
base bonds normal to the surface, so that
the O<sub>2</sub> binding sites face away from the support
surface. In general, the choice of functionality
present in linking agents will be dependent on
substrate surface groups and the selection of selected
gas selective sites. For example, a linking agent
bearing acidic groups could be employed for a substrate
containing basic groups. Other interactions can also
be exploited including H-bonding, electrostatic, and
covalent bonding.</p><p num="0043">Two categories of linking agents are identified as
components of selected gas selective microporous
membranes - linear (non-amplifying) linking agents, and
amplifying linking agents. The term non-amplifying
("linear") linking agents indicates linking agents
where the number of selected gas selective sites
available is less than or equal to the number of
interaction sites or regions with the support. Surface
amplifying linking agents are defined as linking agents
where the number of selected gas selective sites
associated with each linking agent is greater than the
number of surface interaction sites. Schematic
representations of each category are shown in Figure 2. 
Use of amplifying and non-amplifying linking agents is
illustrated for oxygen selective microporous membranes
where the selected gas selective sites are TECs. A
convenient configuration for both classes of linking
agents for oxygen selective microporous membranes
occurs when the linking agent provides a Lewis base
group to serve as an axial donor to a transition metal
center to give an oxygen-selective TEC. For example,
the modification of surfaces by commercial silane
coupling agents, X<sub>3</sub>SiRY, has been disclosed wherein X
is a group for attachment to mineral surfaces, Y is an
organic functional group, and R is a hydrocarbon group.
This example represents non-amplifying covalent
attachment at multiple sites, and examples of coupling
agents include (EtO)<sub>3</sub>SiCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> and
(MeO)<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>.</p><p num="0044">Alternative examples of linear linking agents
which provide Lewis base groups to give oxygen-selective
TEC sites but do not involve surface
modification in a covalent manner include substituted
heterocycles where the functionality is selected for
interaction of aminoalkylpyridines or
aminoalkylimidazoles with an acidic support. The
linking agent can also be selected where the functional
groups used for interaction with the surface and the
transition metal center are the same. Examples of this
class include 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and
hexamethylenetetramine. These cage structures orient
the Lewis base donor and hence TEC sites with respect
to the surface due to steric considerations.</p><p num="0045">Amplifying linking agents can be used as chemical
species where the number of TEC's associated with each 
linking agent is greater than the number of surface
interactions sites. Typically, the amplifying linking
agent provides two or more Lewis base sites (such as
pyridine or imidazole derivatives) capable of binding
TEC's to promote reversible oxygeneration. There could
be on or more sites capable of interacting with the
surface of a support to attach and orient the linking
agent and TEC(s) with respect to the local surface.
The amplifying linking agents generally contain one or
more branching points so that steric effects serve to
orient the Lewis base groups away from the surface.
Amplifying linking agents lead to advantages relative
to linear linking agents. They provide more effective
control of supported TEC reactivity, improved control
of TEC spacing, and greater ease of attachment of TEC's
to a support surface. In addition, they can be
utilized with support surfaces which possess only a
small population of interaction sites per unit area.
Steric effects favor the projection of terminal groups
away from the surface so that TEC orientation is
accomplished.</p><p num="0046">The structure and composition of the amplifying
linking agent is highly versatile and is not restricted
to oxygen selective sites. For example, amine terminal
groups on amplifying linking agents will provide
selectivity for carbon dioxide. Variations can
conveniently be made to one or more of the following
features: the core (including functionality present
and multiplicity); the multiplicity of branching
points; the nature of linking arms; the functionality
present and reactions types; and the structure and
substitution patterns of terminal groups. The TEC 
units can be either incorporated as part of the
amplifying linking agent (covalently attached to the
ligand periphery) or the linking agent can provide
Lewis base donors which interact with transition metal
chelates in an axial manner to give oxygen selective
TEC's. In the latter category, the Lewis base groups
are typically nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen heterocycles,
amines, ethers or thioethers. Specific examples of
terminal groups include substituted pyridines and
substituted imidazoles.</p><p num="0047">Examples of amplifying linking agents bearing
Lewis base groups are provided by modified dendrimers,
particularly the low generation examples.
Modifications to dendrimer structures to provide
terminal Lewis base groups suitable for interaction
with TEC's are accomplished using synthetic
transformations used in dendrimer growth but with
alternative reagents. An amplifying linking agent
designated DIm<sub>6</sub> (defined in Figure 3) has been prepared
using tris(aminoethyl)amine as a core; methyl acrylate
for branching, and an aminoalkyl-substituted
heterocycle to provide terminal groups. Related
structures are possible where the core and the
composition of the terminal unit (heterocycle, linking
arm) are varied. Studies involving the interaction of
DIm<sub>6</sub> with silica gel using uptake and porosity
measurements are consistent with coating of internal
surfaces. The availability of imidazole groups for
coordination to TEC sites is inferred by oxygen
sorption studies after the TEC coating is formed.</p><p num="0048">Both non-amplifying and surface amplifying linking
agents as components of any microporous oxygen 
selective membrane with any TEC and/or substrate are
suitable for use in the subject invention. A specific
example of linking agent utilization occurs when the
linking agent provides a Lewis base donor for axial
coordination to a transition metal chelate to give an
oxygen selective TEC.</p><heading><u style="single">Preparation Using Existing Membrane Substrates</u></heading><p num="0049">The coating of pre-existing membrane substrates
with selected gas selective sites can be accomplished
with or without the intervention of a linking agent.
Examples where the linking agent is not required
include the ion-exchange of cationic selected gas
selective sites with ion exchangeable units on the
internal surface of a microporous membrane substrate.
More typically, a preformed membrane substrate is
combined with a linking agent and the selected gas
selective site such as a TEC for oxygen. This can be
performed either in one step (simultaneous method) or
in two steps (sequential method). Both methods have
been utilized for the preparation of coated particles
involving inorganic supports. In both cases,
pretreatment of the substrate was performed to remove
water or other adsorbed species using methods
appropriate to the substrate and the adsorbate. The
coating procedures for ions or molecules containing
selected gas selective sites should be performed under
controlled conditions. For example, oxygen selective
TECs should be coated under anaerobic conditions.
Solvents are selected based on solubility and
compatibility with ions or molecules containing
selected gas selective sites and other components. For 
sequential methods, it is desirable to use solvents
where the linking agent shows a substantially lower
solubility than the ions or molecules containing
selected gas selective sites.</p><p num="0050">The simultaneous coating method involves
contacting the membrane substrate with a solution
containing ions or molecules containing selected gas
selective sites or their precursors and other required
components including linking agent. The quantities of
coating components are controlled so that monolayer
formation occurs. Solvent removal is used to deposit a
layer of the selected gas selective sites (and linking
agent if present) onto the support surface.</p><p num="0051">The sequential coating method is used to deposit a
monolayer of linking agent onto the support surface in
an initial step. This method is preferred when there
is significant interaction strength between the linking
agent and the substrate. The linking agent is coated
onto the substrate by adsorption from a solution
containing an excess of the linking agent, followed by
contacting the coated substrate with a solution
containing ions or molecules containing selected gas
selective sites under conditions where extraction of
the linking agent from the surface is minimized.</p><p num="0052">The depth of the selected gas selective sites
coated regions in both simultaneous and sequential
coating method can be controlled by adjusting the
method by which the membrane substrate and solutions
are contacted (dependent on substrate configuration).
For example, the use of hollow fiber substrates allows
immersion procedures so that a single face of the
substrate comes in contact with the ions or molecules 
containing selected gas selective sites and/or linking
agent solution. Immersion time, temperature,
solubility, and transport effects will determine the
mobility of the selective sites in the substrate.</p><heading><u style="single">Preparation from Coated Small Particle Assemblies.</u></heading><p num="0053">Two alternative routes are envisaged for the
preparation of microporous selected gas selective
membranes based on small particle assemblies. This is
illustrated for oxygen selective membranes and TEC
sites, but the methods and principles are useful for
other selected gas selective sites. One approach
involves the formation of small particles, coating, and
membrane formation as a single process. An alternative
approach involves isolation of small particles,
coating, and subsequent membrane formation.</p><p num="0054">In the direct formation of TEC-coated small
particle assemblies from solutions, small particle
suspension can be formed using sol-gel technology and
these can be utilized for the formation of porous
glasses. Sol-gel technology is a general method by
which controlled porosity oxides are prepared by
hydrolysis and condensation of suitable precursors,
typically with water and either acid or base catalysis.
For example, preparation of sol-gel porous glasses
incorporating biological species have been prepared
using mild conditions which retain the activity of the
guest molecules. Examples of guest molecules include
bacteriorhodopsin, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase,
cytochrome c, myoglobin, glucose oxidase, trypsin, and
acid phosphotase. In addition, the incorporation of
non-biological molecules has been disclosed including 
spiropyranes to serve as photochromic optical recording
materials.</p><p num="0055">The preparation of microporous oxygen selective
membranes can be performed using a sol-gel route by
addition of TEC and linking agent at the small particle
stage prior to membrane formation. This requires
chemical compatibility of the solvents (such solvents
as toluene, chloroform, dichloromethane) and small
particles with the TEC's and linking agents (if used)
under the conditions employed, In addition the TEC
must be soluble in the solvent system of choice. For
most TEC's, the application of anaerobic conditions is
required, and the use of non-aqueous solvents is
preferred. The application of linking agents
(amplifying or non-amplifying) offers an opportunity
for small particles to be coated in the liquid state
prior to membrane formation.</p><p num="0056">The coated small particle sol-gel system can be
used for membrane formation through technologies such
as slip-casting, or can be converted to dense films by
casting procedures. The coated small particle sol-gel
system may also be used for incorporation on or within
porous substrates. In all cases, the criteria for
material characteristics apply to all separation
membranes based on TEC coated small particles including
TEC spacing, mean pore size, and pore size
distribution, as discussed herein.</p><p num="0057">The post-treatment of membranes to minimize the
effects of defects should be used in the preparation of
air separation systems. For microporous membranes, it
is important to select pre- or post-treatment coatings
which do not substantially degrade either the flux or 
the selectivity of the microporous region. For this
reason, thin coatings of high permeability polymers
such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) or poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne)
(PTMSP) are preferred. An
additional requirement is that the pre- or post-treatment
must be compatible with the TEC sites.</p><p num="0058">The microporous selected gas selective membranes
of the subject invention combine high permeabilities
with high selectivity by employing selected gas
selective sites to enable surface transport of the
selected gas in a microporous system. The high
permeabilities and high selectivity is achieved using
coatings of organized selected gas selective sites
which exhibit reversible chemisorption of the selected
gas. This is illustrated for oxygen selective
microporous membranes using TECs as active sites. For
example, the general features of oxygen selective TEC's
are illustrated in Figure 1 using a combination of
tetradentate donor (equatorial ligand) and a
monodentate donor (axial ligand) to a cobalt(II)
center. Other examples of five-coordinate deoxy TEC
sites consisting of one or more chelating ligands are
equally applicable and are well-known to those skilled
in the art. Schematic representation of individual
pores for microporous oxygen selective membranes
incorporating TEC's using organized and non-organized
arrangements are shown in Figure 4.</p><p num="0059">Desirable properties for microporous oxygen
selective membranes include oxygen permeabilities
greater than 10<sup>+3</sup> Barrer with selectivities α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>)
over 4. Preferred properties involve oxygen 
permeabilities over 2 x 10<sup>+3</sup> Barrer with α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>)
greater than 10.</p><p num="0060">Gas selective interactions with pore walls or
modified pore walls can result in an enhanced transport
of one or more component by surface diffusion.
Computer simulation studies have been performed for
microporous membranes based on a conduit model and
these include contributions from multiple transport
pathways (Poisseuille, Knudsen, surface diffusion).
This model has been utilized to examine separation
capabilities of microporous oxygen selective membranes
incorporating TEC units and for comparison with systems
exhibiting physical adsorption. Transport
characteristics of the microporous membranes are
evaluated as a function of surface diffusion
coefficient, effective site or adsorbate footprint,
free pore radius, and equilibrium coefficients for
selective sites. For the purposes of this document,
the term "footprint" is used to describe the average
surface area required for each selected gas (adsorbate)
molecule and hence describes the spacing between
adsorption sites or regions. Values of TEC footprints
and equilibrium coefficients for oxygen interaction are
based on values found in the literature. For non-TEC
systems, oxygen and nitrogen footprints of 14.1 and
16.2(Å)<sup>2</sup> were used, and adsorption equilibrium
parameters are based on known materials. In each case,
surface diffusion coefficients are based on typical
values reported in the open literature (10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup>
cm<sup>2</sup>/s) including surface diffusion of carbon dioxide in
microporous alumina membranes, nitrogen diffusion in 
graphite powder compacts, and CO<sub>2</sub> or hydrocarbon
surface transport in porous glass. The use of these
values for TEC's is reasonably based on studies for the
diffusion between TEC sites in polymer materials (D<sub>cc</sub> ∼
10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s) which includes diffusion within the
polymer.</p><p num="0061">Specific examples for oxygen describing the
permeation characteristics of microporous oxygen
selective membranes containing TEC's obtained using the
conduit model are shown in Tables 1-4. In these
particular examples, surface diffusion of nitrogen is
neglected. <tables><table><tgroup cols="6"><tbody><row><entry nameend="6" namest="1">Permeation in Microporous Membranes.

impact of free pore diameter, site footprint, and
oxygen surface diffusion coefficient on the oxygen
permeability and the separation factor α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of the
conduit for a synthetic air feed consisting of 20 kPa
O<sub>2</sub> and 80 kPa N<sub>2</sub>, and with a site affinity coefficient
of 150 torr. The downstream pressure is set at 1 kPa
O<sub>2</sub> and 0 kPa N<sub>2</sub>. Simulations for alternative feed and
product pressures show similar trends. These
simulations indicate that increasing the TEC footprint 
or increasing the free pore diameter leads to a
reduction in oxygen permeability and separation factor
of the conduit. In addition, it is evident that higher
surface diffusion coefficients result in increased
oxygen permeabilities and separation factors. As an
example, a microporous oxygen selective membrane
incorporating a close-packed arrangement of TEC's with
footprint 250(Å)<sup>2</sup> and an oxygen affinity coefficient
P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>), of 150 torr is expected to show a conduit
permeability of 2.068 X 10<sup>+6</sup> Barrer and a selectivity
α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 10.9 if a surface diffusion coefficient of
10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s is realized and the free pore diameter is 10Å
(see Table 1).</p><p num="0063">The conduit model has also been used to examine
the permeation characteristics of a microporous
membrane with a synthetic air feed (20 kPa O<sub>2</sub> and 80
kPa N<sub>2</sub>), a product of 1 kPa oxygen, and using a fixed
TEC footprint of 100(Å)<sup>2</sup> (see Table 2). At fixed free
pore diameter, the oxygen permeability and separation
factor can be optimized by choice of affinity
coefficient (expressed as P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>). It is anticipated
that the optimum affinity coefficient will be dependent
on the feed composition and pressure. Table 2 also
illustrates that high separation factors are
anticipated for small free pore diameters, high surface
diffusion coefficients, and small site footprints. As
an example, a microporous membrane with a free pore
diameter of 10 (Å)<sup>2</sup>, a P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) of 150 torr and an
oxygen surface diffusion coefficient of 10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/sec,
with a synthetic air feed of 20 kPa O<sub>2</sub> and 80 kPa N<sub>2</sub> is
expected to show a conduit oxygen permeability of 4.904 
x 10<sup>+6</sup> Barrer and α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) of 25.78 based on
calculations for pure gases.</p><p num="0064">The effect of product pressure on permeation
characteristics for microporous membranes has been
examined using a conduit model, and the results are
presented in Table 3 for a site footprint of 100(Å)<sup>2</sup>
and an oxygen surface diffusion coefficient of 10<sup>-4</sup>
cm<sup>2</sup>/s as a function of free pore diameter and P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>).
These studies indicate that there are large differences
in selectivities α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) for downstream pressures of 1
kPa and 0 kPa oxygen for cases where the affinity
coefficient of TEC sites, P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) is low, but that the
difference is reduced as the P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) approaches or
exceeds the upstream oxygen pressure.</p><p num="0065">Permeation characteristics predicted using a
conduit model have so far neglected contributions from
the surface diffusion of nitrogen. Additional studies
were performed to evaluate the validity of this
approaching a TEC footprint of 150 (Å)<sup>2</sup>, a nitrogen
footprint of 16.2(Å)<sup>2</sup>, surface diffusion coefficients
of 10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for oxygen and nitrogen and using free
pore diameter and nitrogen affinity coefficient as
variables. The results are shown graphically in Figure
5 compared to selectivities in the absence of a
nitrogen interaction. The differences in selectivities
diminish with increasing free pore diameter or when
P<sub>1/2</sub>(N<sub>2</sub>) is large. Experimental studies of equilibrium
properties for adsorbents based on TEC coated
substrates confirm that nitrogen loadings are low,
corresponding to large P<sub>1/2</sub>(N<sub>2</sub>). </p><p num="0066">In one of the preferred embodiments, the invention
involves the reversible chemisorption of oxygen using
organized TEC sites on a suitable substrate to form a
microporous membrane. The conduit model described here
has been utilized to compare permeation characteristics
for membranes containing TEC's with adsorbent membranes
incorporating carbonaceous, zeolitic or similar
coatings as utilized in prior art. The modeling
studies for non-TEC coatings involve footprints for
oxygen and nitrogen of 14.1 and 16.2 (Å)<sup>2</sup> respectively
and surface diffusion coefficients of 10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s. The
interaction parameters for each adsorbate are based on
equilibrium properties for known adsorbent materials.
Selectivities, α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>), for membranes exhibiting
physical adsorption of oxygen and nitrogen are compared
in Figure 6. In all cases, the selectivity α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) is
less than 2 which is significantly lower than for
comparable TEC based materials (see Figure 5). In
addition, the oxygen permeabilities for microporous
membranes incorporating surface TEC sites are compared
with similar materials containing either zeolite or
carbon coatings in Figure 7. For all conditions
examined, the permeabilities and selectivities for TEC
coatings are substantially better than for adsorbent
membranes containing zeolite or carbon coatings.</p><p num="0067">Since the majority of substrates and coating
methods do not give uniform pores, the impact of pore
size distribution has been examined using the conduit
model. This analysis is based on a pore size
distribution involving 25% pores with diameter 5Å, 50%
with diameter 10.0Å, 20% with diameter 15.0Å, and 5% 
with diameter 20.0Å. The contributions of different
sized pores to the net permeation is illustrated in
Table 4 at 300K, with a TEC footprint 100(Å)<sup>2</sup>, P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)
75 torr, with a synthetic air feed (20 kPa O<sub>2</sub>, 80 kPa
N<sub>2</sub>) and with a downstream pressure of 10 kPa oxygen and
40 kPa nitrogen. For an oxygen surface diffusion
coefficient of 10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s, the selectivity α(O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>)
20.58 and conduit P(O<sub>2</sub>) is 4.1 x 10<sup>+6</sup> Barrer.</p><p num="0068">It is evident that a small population of larger
pores can have a large impact on net gas transport and
obscure contributions from active surface diffusion
even for highly uniform coatings. Control of pore size
distribution can be addressed in part by substrate
selection and synthetic methods. In addition, the use
of pre- or post-treatment can be used to minimize the
effects of an unfavorable pore size distribution.</p><p num="0069">The conduit pore model demonstrates that
microporous membranes incorporating organized oxygen
selective TEC coatings are capable of higher oxygen
permeabilities and selectivities than alternative
coatings which exhibit physical adsorption. The
permeation characteristics of the microporous oxygen
selective membranes are dependent on a number of
features, and best performance is anticipated for small
free pore diameters less than 25Å, preferable 20Å and
most preferably less than 15Å with a narrow pore size
distribution (preferable uniform) involving close-packed
arrangements of TEC's which possess small site
footprints preferably less than 200(Å)<sup>2</sup> and most
preferably less than 100(Å)<sup>2</sup> and high oxygen surface
diffusion coefficients preferably greater than 1x10<sup>-5</sup> 
cm<sup>2</sup>/s and more preferably greater than 1x10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s. In
all cases, the thickness of the separation layer should
preferably be kept at a minimum (preferable less than
2000Å and most preferably less than 1000Å). The
P<sub>1/2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) TEC sites and the feed product pressures should
be optimized for the required separation.</p><p num="0070">The conduit model was developed to describe
permeation in straight, uniform pores. However,
adjustments can be made to account for surface porosity
and to accommodate tortuosity. Where possible,
microporous oxygen selective membranes with straight
uniform pores are preferred.</p><p num="0071">One embodiment of the subject invention provides
highly desirable oxygen-selective microporous membranes
incorporating supported TEC's preferably in the solid
phase capable of enhances utilization and sorption
rates. Thus, the microporous membranes with TEC of the
invention are highly advantageous for practical
commercial operations.</p><p num="0072">Although the invention has been described with
reference to specific embodiments as examples, it will
be appreciated that it is intended to cover all
modifications and equivalents within the scope of the
appended claims.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>A selected gas-selective microporous membrane
