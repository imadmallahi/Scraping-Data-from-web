polyether polyamines and to their use for the production of polyureas with
good hardness and flexibility.</p><heading><u style="single">Description of the Prior Art</u></heading><p num="0002">Two-component coating compositions containing a polyisocyanate
component and a polyaspartate component are known and disclosed in
U.S. Patents 5,126,170, 5,236,741, 5,489,704 and 5,516,873. The
polyaspartates may be used as the only isocyanate-reactive component or
they may be blended with polyols, polyamines or blocked polyamines,
such as ketimines, aldimines or oxazolidines. The compositions are
suitable for the preparation of high quality coatings that are abrasion
resistant, solvent resistant and weather resistant.</p><p num="0003">One of the deficiencies of these polyaspartates is that when
reacted with polyisocyanates they do not form coatings with a good
combination of hardness and flexibility, which can be seen from the low
hardnesses and elongations of the resulting coatings. One method for
improving the flexibility is to prepare the polyaspartates from high
molecular weight polyether polyamines, such as Jeffamine D-2000
(available from Huntsman). However, as disclosed in WO 01/07504, the
reaction of equimolar amounts of this polyether polyamine with diethyl
maleate to form the polyaspartate is only 78% complete after 73 days, and
it takes more than 2 years for the reaction to be 100% complete.</p><p num="0004">Based on these teachings it would be expected that the preparation
of a polyaspartate from a mixture of polyether polyamines would require
an unacceptably long reaction time to achieve a complete or a
substantially complete reaction. </p><p num="0005">Other alternatives for reducing the reaction time are also not
feasible. For example, if a large excess of the ester of maleic or fumaric
acid is used to reduce the reaction time, then it is necessary to remove the
unreacted excess when the reaction is completed, which is a time-consuming,
expensive procedure. It is also not feasible to prepare large
quantities of the polyaspartates resins in advance because it is extremely
difficult to predict customers' needs for the products and because of
expensive storage and inventory costs.</p><p num="0006">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide
polyasparate resins that can be reacted with polyisocyanates to obtain
coatings with improved hardness and flexibility. It is an additional object of
the present invention to provide polyaspartate resins that can be prepared
with a short reaction time.</p><p num="0007">Surprisingly, these objects may be achieved with the polyaspartate
resins according to the present invention which are prepared from a
mixture of polyoxypropylene polyamines and low molecular weight
polyether amines. When reacted with polyisocyanates the resulting
coatings possess a good combination of hardness and flexibility. In
addition, the polyaspartate resins can be prepared with a relatively'short
reaction time, which is surprising in view of the prior art which teaches that
excessively long reaction times are required to prepare polyaspartates
from polyether polyamines.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0008">The present invention relates to polyaspartate mixtures containing

5 to 50 equiv.%, preferably 5 to 40 equiv.% and more preferably 5 to 20
equiv.% of polyoxypropylene polyaspartates a) and 50 to 95 equiv.%,

polyether polyaspartates b), wherein the preceding equiv.% are based on
the total equivalents of aspartate groups. </p><p num="0012">Polyoxypropylene polyaspartates a) correspond to formula I

than 300, wherein the amino groups are attached to primary carbon
atoms and the ether groups are separated by at least two carbon
atoms.</dd></dl></p><p num="0013">In both formulas I and II
<dl tsize="9"><dt>R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub></dt><dd>are identical or different and represent organic groups which
are inert to isocyanate groups at a temperature of 100°C or less,

when the polyaspartates are prepared from mixed maleates, such as
methylethyl maleate. In addition, one R<sub>1</sub> may be different from another
R<sub>1</sub>. For example, when a mixture of maleates, e.g. dimethyl and diethyl
maleate, is used to prepare the polyaspartate, one pair of R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>
groups will be methyl and the other will be ethyl.</p><p num="0015">The polyaspartates may be prepared in accordance with known
process conditions as described in U.S. Patent 5,126,170, herein
incorporated by reference. According to a preferred embodiment of the
present invention in the first step of the reaction one equivalent of maleic
or fumaric acid esters corresponding to the formula
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R<sub>1</sub>OOC-CR<sub>3</sub>=CR<sub>4</sub>-COOR<sub>2</sub></st32:che>
are reacted with 5 to 50 equiv.% of polyoxypropylene polyamines
corresponding to the formula
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">X<sub>1</sub>-(-NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub></st32:che>
to form polyoxypropylene polyaspartates a). The equiv.% of the
polyoxypropylene polyamine is determined by dividing the equivalents of
primary amino groups in the polyoxypropylene polyamine by the
equivalents of unsaturated groups present in the maleic or fumaric acid
esters of formula IV and multiplying the quotient by 100. The reaction may
be carried out at a temperature of 0 to 100°C, preferably 20 to 65°C.</p><p num="0016">The reaction may be carried out solvent-free or in the presence of
suitable solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, aromatic
solvents such as toluene and mixtures of such solvents. Preferably, the
reaction is carried out solvent-free. It is preferred to add the amine to the
flask and then to add the maleic or fumaric acid ester such that the 
exothermic reaction is controllable. However, it is also possible to add the
maleic or fumaric acid ester to the flask and slowly add the amine to the
mixture. There is no need to use a catalyst, although one can be added to
increase the reaction rate. Depending upon the temperature, the excess
of unsaturated ester and the steric hindrance in the polyoxypropylene
polyamine, the conversion of the polyoxypropylene polyamine to the
polyoxypropylene polyaspartate a) is at least 98%, preferably 100%,
complete in less than one week. By using a larger excess of the
unsaturated ester, it is possible to reduce the reaction time to less 24
hours.</p><p num="0017">In the second step of the process the remaining equivalents of the
unsaturated esters of formula III are reacted with a substantially equivalent
amount of a polyether polyamine corresponding to the formula
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">X<sub>2</sub>-(-NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub></st32:che>
This reaction conditions used in the first step are also suitable for use in
the second step of the process. Excess starting materials and solvents,
especially isocyanate-reactive solvents, may be removed by distillation
after the reaction. The reaction is generally complete within four to six
weeks after the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature.</p><p num="0018">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention
polyoxypropylene polyaspartates a) and polyether polyaspartates b) are
separately prepared and mixed in the desired ratios to form the
polyaspartate mixtures. These mixtures can be used to prepare polyureas
having good hardness and flexibility. However, when the polyaspartates
are separately prepared the advantages of a faster reaction time will not
be obtained. To obtain these improvements, it is necessary to prepare the
polyaspartate mixtures in accordance with the preferred process
previously set forth.</p><p num="0019">Suitable polyoxypropylene polyamines corresponding to formula IV
are known can be prepared by methods such as those described in 
German Offenlegungsschrift No. 1,193,671, U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,895,
French. Pat. No. 1,466,708, by the amination of polyoxypropylene polyols,
which in turn are prepared by the alkoxylation of 1,2-propylene oxide. The
polyoxypropylene polyamines preferably have a number average
molecular weight of 200 to 5000, more preferably 1000 to 5000 and most
preferably 1500 to 3000. Examples of polyoxypropylene diamines include
Jeffamine D-2000 and Jeffamine D-230, both of which can be obtained
from Huntsman Corporation. Examples of polyoxypropylene triamines
include Jeffamine T-403, Jeffamine T-3000 and Jeffamine T-5000, which
are also available from Huntsman.</p><p num="0020">Suitable polyether amines corresponding to formula V are those
having linear or branched hydrocarbon chains interrupted by ether groups
and having a number average molecular weight of less than 5000,
preferably less than 3000, more preferably less than 600, and most
preferably less than 300. The amino groups are attached to primary
carbons and the ether groups are separated by at least two carbons.
Preferably, the backbone of the polyether contains oxypropylene and/or
oxyethylene groups.</p><p num="0021">Preferred polyamines are those corresponding to the formula

be converted to hydantoin groups in known manner, e.g., by heating the 
compounds at elevated temperatures, optionally in the presence of a
catalyst. Hydantoin groups will also form over time under ambient
conditions. Therefore, the term "urea groups" is also intended to include
other compounds containing the group, N-CO-N, such as hydantoin
groups.</p><p num="0043">The invention is further illustrated, but is not intended to be limited
