Their rubbery-ness and lack of hysteresis are due to the amorphous nature of their midblocks. Such gels are hereafter referred to as "non-crystalline gels" or more simply as "amorphous gels".</p><p>In general, the overall physical properties of amorphous gels are better at higher gel rigidities. The amorphous gels, however, can fail catastrophically when cut or notched while under applied forces of high dynamic and static deformations, such as extreme compression, torsion, high tension, high elongation, and the like. Additionally, the development of cracks or crazes resulting from a large number of deformation cycles can induce catastrophic fatigue failure of amorphous gel composites, such as tears and rips between the surfaces of the amorphous gel and substrates or at the interfaces of interlocking material(s) and gel. Consequently, such amorphous gels are inadequate for the most demanding applications involving endurance at high stress and strain levels over an extended period of time.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>I have now discovered gels with novel properties which comprises: (I) 100 parts by weight of one or more high viscosity linear, branched, star-shaped (radial), or multiarm block copolymers or mixtures of two or more such block copolymers, said block copolymers having one or more midblocks, said midblocks comprising one or more substantially crystalline polyethylene midblocks and with nil, one or more amorphous midblocks; optionally in combination with a selected amount of one or more of a (II) polymer or copolymer, and selected amounts of a plasticizing oil (III) sufficient to achieve gel rigidities of from less than about 2 gram Bloom to about 1,800 gram Bloom with the proviso that said block copolymers having nil amorphous midblocks are combined with at least one block copolymer having at least one amorphous midblock.</p><p>As used herein, the term "gel rigidity" in gram Bloom is determined by the gram weight required to depress a gel a distance of 4 mm with a piston having a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimeter at 23</p><p>The gels comprising thermoplastic elastomer block copolymers having one or more substantially crystalline polyethylene midblocks of the invention are hereafter referred to as "elastic-crystalline gels" or simpler "crystal gels". The block midblocks of copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention are characterized by sufficient crystallinity as to exhibit a melting endotherm of at least about 40 curve.</p><p>The various types of high viscosity block copolymers employed in forming the crystal gels of the invention are of the general configurations A-Z-A and (A-Z).sub.n, wherein the subscript n is two or more. In the case of multiarm block copolymers where n is 2, the block copolymer denoted by (A-Z).sub.n is A-Z-A. It is understood that the coupling agent is ignored for sake of simplicity in the description of the (A-Z).sub.n block copolymers.</p><p>The end block segment (A) comprises a glassy amorphous polymer end block segment which can be polystyrene, poly(alpha-methylstyrene), poly(o-methylstyrene), poly(m-methylstryene), poly(p-methylstyrene) and the like, preferably, polystyrene. The midblocks (Z) comprises one or more midblocks of substantially crystalline poly(ethylene) (simply denoted by "-E- or (E)") with or without one or more amorphous midblocks of poly(butylene), poly(ethylene-butylene), poly(ethylene-propylene) or combination thereof (the amorphous midblocks are denoted by "-B- or (B)", "-EB- or (EB)", and "-EP- or (EP)" respectively or simply denoted by "-W- or (W)" when referring to one or more of the amorphous midblocks as a group) The A and Z portions are incompatible and form a two or more-phase system consisting of sub-micron amorphous glassy domains (A) interconnected by (Z) chains. The glassy domains serve to crosslink and reinforce the structure. This physical elastomeric network structure is reversible, and heating the polymer above the softening point of the glassy domains temporarily disrupt the structure, which can be restored by lowering the temperature.</p><p>The (I) linear block copolymers are characterized as having a Brookfield Viscosity value at 5 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 30 advantageously from about 40 cps to about 160 cps and higher, more advantageously from about 50 cps to about 180 cps and higher, still more advantageously from about 70 cps to about 210 cps and higher, and even more advantageously from about 90 cps to about 380 cps and higher.</p><p>The (I) branched, star-shaped (radial), or multiarm block copolymers are characterized as having a Brookfield Viscosity value at 5 weight percent solids solution in toluene at 30 380 cps and higher, advantageously from about 150 cps to about 260 cps and higher, more advantageously from about 200 cps to about 580 cps and higher, and still more advantageously from about 100 cps to about 800 cps and higher.</p><p>The crystal gels can be made in combination with a selected amount of one or more selected polymers and copolymers (II) including thermoplastic crystalline polyurethane elastomers with hydrocarbon blocks, homopolymers, copolymers, block copolymers, polyethylene copolymers, polypropylene copolymers, and the like described below.</p><p>The crystal gels of the invention are also suitable in physically interlocking or forming with other selected materials to form composites combinations. The materials are selected from the group consisting of paper, foam, plastic, fabric, metal, metal foil, concrete, wood, glass, various natural and synthetic fibers, including glass fibers, ceramics, synthetic resin, and refractory materials.</p><p>The various aspects and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the accompanying disclosure.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1.

The above applications, patents and publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Legge's paper teaches the development of (conventional substantially amorphous elastomer midsegment) SEBS triblock copolymers. In the polymerization of butadiene by alkylithium initiators, 1,4-addition or 1,2-addition polymers, mixtures, can be obtained. In forming styrene butadiene triblock copolymers involving the addition of solvating agents such as ethers just before the final styrene charge is added, any excess of ethers can alter the polybutadiene structure from a 1,4-cis or trans structure to a 1,2- or 3,4-addition polymer. Using difunctional coupling agent would give linear block copolymers and multifuntional agents would give star-shaped or radial block copolymers. Hydrogenation of the 1,4-polybutadiene structure yields polyethylene, while that of the 1,2-polybutadiene yields polybutylene. The resulting polyethylene will be essentially identical with linear, high-density polyethylene with a melting point, Tm, of about 136 1,2-polybutadiene would yield atactic poly(1-butene) (polybutylene). The Tg of polybutylene is around -18 and butylene units in the chain would suppress crystallinity arising from polyethylene sequences. The objective for a good elastomer should be to obtain a saturated olefin elastomeric segment with the lowest possible Tg and the best elastomeric properties. Such an elastomer favored using styrene as the hard-block monomer and selecting the best monomer for hydrogenation of the elastomer midsegment. Using a mixture of 1,4- and 1,2-polybutadiene as the base polymer for the midsegment would result in an ethylene/butylene midsegment in the final product. The elements of selection of the midsegment composition is elastomer crystallinity and the elastomer Tg of an ethylene/butylene copolymer. Very low levels of crystallinity can be achieved around 40-50% butylene concentration. The minimum in dynamic hysteresis around 35% butylene concentration in the elastomeric copolymer. A value of 40% butylene concentration in the ethylene/butylene midsegment was chosen for the S-EB-S block copolymers.</p><p>Clair's paper teaches that the EB midblock of conventional S-EB-S polymers is a random copolymer of ethylene and 1-butene exhibiting nearly no crystallinity in the midblock. In the preparation of ethylene-butylene (EB) copolymers, the relative proportions of ethylene and butylene in the EB copolymer chain can be controlled over a broad range from almost all ethylene to almost all butylene. When the EB copolymer is nearly all ethylene, the methylene sequences will crystallize exhibiting properties similar to low density polyethylene. In differential scanning calorimeter (DCS) curves, the melting endotherm is seen on heating and a sharp crystallization exotherm is seen on cooling. As the amount of butylene in the EB copolymer is increased, the methylene sequences are interrupted by the ethyl side chains which shorten the methylene sequences length so as to reduce the amount of crystallinity in the EB copolymer. In conventional S-EB-S polymers, the amount of 1-butene is controlled at a high enough level to make the EB copolymer midblock almost totally amorphous so as to make the copolymer rubbery and soluble in hydrocarbon solvents. Clair suggests that an S-EB-S polymer retaining at least some crystallinity in the EB copolymer midblock may be desirable. Therefore, a new family of S-EB-S polymers are developed (U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,234) in which the midblock contains a higher percentage of ethylene. The molecular weights of the new crystalline midblock segment S-EB-S polymers can vary from low molecular weight, intermediate molecular, to high molecular weight; these are designated Shell GR-3, GR-1, and GR-2 respectively. Unexpectly, the highest molecular weight polymer, GR-2 exhibits an anomalously low softening point. A broad melting endotherm is seen in the DSC curves or these polymers. The maximum in this broad endotherm occurs at about 40</p><p>Block copolymers with polyethylene midblocks alone do not form suitable gels for purpose of the invention. Crystalline midblock regions needs to be balanced with amorphous midblock regions in order to obtain soft, flexible and elastic gels with the desired crystalline properties that are not found in totally amorphous gels.</p><p>The various representative crystalline/glassy domain/amorphous structures of S-E-EB-S, S-EB.sub.45 -EP-S, S-E-EB.sub.25 -S, S-E-EP-E-S, S-EP-E-S and S-EP-E-EP-S are illustrate in FIGS. 5-10 above. Although the structure are spheroid representation, cylinders and plates are also within the scope of the present invention. Cylinder and plate structure are obtained with increasing glassy A end blocks. From about 15-30% by weight of A blocks, the block copolymer structure is spheroid. From about 33 about 40% by weight of A blocks, the block copolymer structure becomes cylindrical; and above about 45% A blocks, the structure becomes less cylindrical and more plate like.</p><p>In order to obtain elastic crystal gels of the invention, it is necessary that the selective synthesis of butadiene produce sufficient amounts of 1,4 poly(butadiene) that on hydrogenation can exhibit "crystallinity" in the midblocks. In order for the block copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention to exhibit crystallinity, the crystalline midblock segments must contain long runs of --CH.sub.2 -- groups. There should be approximately at least 16 units of --(CH.sub.2)-- in sequence for crystallinity. Only the (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 units can crystallize, and then only if there are at least 4 units of (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 in sequence; alternatively, the polyethylene units are denoted by [(CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2)--].sub.4, [(--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 ].sup.4 or (--CH.sub.2 --).sup.16. The amount of (--CH2--).sup.16 units forming the (E) midblocks of the block copolymers comprising the crystal gels of the invention should be at least about 20% which amount is capable of exhibiting a melting endotherm in differential scanning calorimeter (DCS) curves.</p><p>Advantageously, the elastomer midblock segment should have a crystallinity of at least about 20% of (--CH.sub.2 --)16 units of the total mole % forming the midblocks of the block copolymer, more advantageously at least about 25%, still more advantageously at least about 30%, especially advantageously at least about 40% and especially more advantageously at least about 50% and higher. Broadly, the crystallinity of the midblocks should range from at least about 20% to about 60%, less broadly from at least about 18% to about 65%, and still less broadly from at least 22% to about 70%.</p><p>The melting endotherm in DSC curves of the crystalline block copolymers comprising at least 20% crystallinity are much higher than conventional amorphous block copolymers. The maximum in the endotherm curves of the crystalline block copolymers occurs at about 40 from greater than about 25 The crystalline block copolymers forming the crystal gels of the invention can exhibit melting endotherms (as shown by DSC) of about 25 about 75 the crystalline midblock block copolymers include: about 28 29 34 39 44 49 54 59 64 69 74 79 C., 120 conventional amorphous midblock segment block copolymers are about 10</p><p>The melting endotherm is seen on heating and a sharp crystallization exotherm is seen on cooling. Such midblock crystallization endothermic and exothermic characteristics are missing from DCS curves of amorphous gels. The crystallization exotherm and fusion endortherm of the crystalline block copolymer gels of the invention are determined by ASTM D 3417 method.</p><p>Generally, the method of obtaining long runs of crystalline --(CH.sub.2)-- is by sequential block copolymer synthesis followed by hydrogenation. The attainment of crystal gels of the instant invention is solely due to the selective polymerization of the butadiene monomer (forming the midblocks) resulting in one or more predetermined amount of 1,4 poly(butadine) blocks followed by sequential polymerization of additional midblocks and hydrogenation to produce one or more crystalline midblocks of the final block copolymers.</p><p>The crystalline block copolymers are made by sequential block copolymer synthesis, the percentage of crystallinity or (--CH.sub.2 --).sup.16 units should be at least about (0.67).sup.4 or about 20% and actual crystallinity of about 12%. For example, a selectively synthesized S-EB.sub.n -S copolymer having a ratio of 33:67 of 1,2 and 1,4 poly(butadiene) on hydrogenation will result in a midblock with a crystallinity of (0.67).sup.4 or 20%. For sake of simplicity, when n is a subscript of -EB-, n denotes the percentage of (--CH2--).sub.4 units, eg, n=33 or 20% crystallinity which is the percentage of (0.67).sup.4 or "(--CH.sub.2 --).sub.16 " units. Thus, when n=28 or 72% of (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 units, the % crystallinity is (0.72).sup.4 or 26.87% crystallinity attributed to (--CH.sub.2 --) .sub.16 units, denoted by -EB.sub.28 -. As a matter of convention, and for purposes of this specification involving hydrogenated polybutadiene: the notation -E- denotes at least about 85% of (--CH.sub.2 --).sub.4 units. The notation -B- denotes at least about 70% of [--CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)--] units. The notation -EB- denotes between about 15 and 70% [--CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)--] units. The notation -EB.sub.n - denotes n% [--CH.sub.2 --CH(C.sub.2 H.sub.5)--] units. For hydrogenated polyisoprene: The notation -EP- denotes about at least 90% [--CH.sub.2 --CH(CH.sub.3)--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --] units.</p><p>Generally, one or more (E) midblocks can be incorporated at various positions along the midblocks of the block copolymers. Using the sequential process for block copolymer synthesis, The (E) midblocks can be positioned as follows:</p><p>i) A-E-W-A</p><p>ii) A-E-W-E-A</p><p>ii) A-W-E-W-A</p><p>iii) A-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-A</p><p>iv) A-W-E-W-A-E-A-E-W-E-A</p><p>v) and etc.</p><p>The lower flexibility of block copolymer crystal gels due to (E) midblocks can be balanced by the addition of sequentially (W) midblocks. For example, the sequentially synthesized block copolymer S-E-EB-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of amorphous -EB- block. The sequential block copolymer S-E-EB-B-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of amorphous -EB- and -B- midblocks. The sequential block copolymer S-E-EP-E-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of -EP- midblock. The sequential block copolymer S-E-B-S can maintain a high degree of flexibility due to the presence of the -B- midblock. For S-E-S, where the midblock is substantially crystalline and flexibility low, physical blending with amorphous block copolymers such as S-EB-S, S-B-S, S-EP-S, S-EB-EP-S, (S-EP).sub.n and the like can produce more softer, less rigid, and more flexible crystal gel.</p><p>Because of the (E) midblocks, the crystal gels of the invention exhibit different physical characteristics and improvements over substantially amorphous gels including damage tolerance, improved crack propagation resistance, improved tear resistance producing knotty tears as opposed to smooth tears, crystalline melting point of at least 28 improved resistance to fatigue, higher hysteresis, etc. Moreover, the crystal gels when stretched exhibit additional yielding as shown by necking caused by stress induced crystallinity. Additionally, the crystallization rates of the crystalline midblocks can be controlled and slowed depending on thermal history producing time delay recovery upon deformation.</p><p>Regarding resistance to fatigue, fatigue (as used herein) is the decay of mechanical properties after repeated application of stress and strain. Fatigue tests give information about the ability of a material to resist the development of cracks or crazes resulting from a large number of deformation cycles. Fatigue test can be conducted by subjecting samples of amorphous and crystal gels to deformation cycles to failure (appearance of cracks, crazes, rips or tears in the gels).</p><p>Tensile strength can be determined by extending a selected gel sample to break as measured at 180 to a spring scale. Likewise, tear strength of a notched sample can be determined by propagating a tear as measured at 180 a 5.0 mm diameter mandrel attached to a spring scale.</p><p>Various block copolymers can be obtained which are amorphous, highly rubbery, and exhibiting minimum dynamic hysteresis:</p><heading>Block copolymer S-EB-S</heading><p>The monomer butadiene can be polymerized in a ether/hydrocarbon solvent to give a 50/50 ratio of 1,2 poly(butadiene)/1,4 poly(butadiene) and on hydrogenation no long runs of --CH.sub.2 -- groups and negligible crystallinity, ie, about (0.5).sup.4 or 0.06 or 6% and actual crystallinity of about 3%. Due to the constraints of T.sub.g and minimum hysteresis, conventional S-EB-S have ethylene-butylene ratios of about 60:40 with a crystallinity of about (0.6).sup.4 or 0.129 or 12% and actual crystallinity of about 7.7%.</p><heading>Block copolymer S-EP-S</heading><p>The monomer isoprene when polymerized will produce 95% 1,4 poly(isoprene)/5% 3,4 poly(isoprene) and upon hydrogenation will form amorphous, rubbery poly(ethylene-propylene) midblock and no long runs of --CH.sub.2 -- and no crystallinity.</p><heading>Mixed block copolymer S-EB/EP-S</heading><p>The polymerization of a 50/50 mixture of isoprene/butadiene monomers in suitable ether/hydrocarbon solvents to give equal amounts of 1,2 and 1,4 poly(butadiene) on hydrogenation will produce a maximum crystallinity of (0.25).sup.4 or 0.4%. The actual crystallinity would be approximately about 0.2%, which is negligible and results in a good rubbery midblock.</p><p>The polymerization of a 80/20 mixture of isoprene/butadiene monomers in suitable ether/hydrocarbon solvents to give equal amounts of 1,2 and 1,4 poly(butadiene) will upon hydrogenation produce a low crystallinity of (0.10).sup.4 or 0.01%.

It should be noted that multiblock copolymers including SEPTON 4045, 4055, 4077 and the like are described in my cited copending parent applications and are the subject matter of related inventions.</p><p>The block copolymers (II) such as Kraton G 1654X having ratios of 31:69 or higher can be used and do exhibit about the same physical properties in many respects to Kraton G 1651 while Kraton G 1654X with ratios below 31:69 may also be use, but they are less advantageous due to their decrease in the desirable properties of the final gel.</p><p>Plasticizers (III) particularly advantageous for use in practicing the present invention are will known in the art, they include rubber processing oils such as paraffinic and naphthenic petroleum oils, highly refined aromatic-free paraffinic and naphthenic food and technical grade white petroleum mineral oils, and synthetic liquid oligomers of polybutene, polypropene, polyterpene, etc. The synthetic series process oils are high viscosity oligomers which are permanently fluid liquid nonolefins, isoparaffins or paraffins of moderate to high molecular weight.</p><p>Examples of representative commercially available plasticizing oils include Amoco functionality at one end of the polybutene polymer, liquid poly(ethylene/butylene), liquid hetero-telechelic polymers of poly(ethylene/butylene/styrene) with epoxidized polyisoprene and poly(ethylene/butylene) with epoxidized polyisoprene: Example of such polybutenes include: L-14 (320 Mn), L-50 (420 Mn), L-100 (460 Mn), H-15 (560 Mn), H-25 (610 Mn), H-35 (660 Mn), H-50 (750 Mn), H-100 (920 Mn), H-300 (1290 Mn), L-14E (27-37 cst @ 100 (635-690 cst @ 210 Mn), E23 (1433 Mn), Kraton L-2203 and Kraton L-1203, EKP-206, EKP-207, HPVM-2203 and the like. Example of various commercially oils include: ARCO Prime (55, 70, 90, 200, 350, 400 and the like), Duraprime and Tufflo oils (6006, 6016, 6016M, 6026, 6036, 6056, 6206, etc) , other white mineral oils include: Bayol, Bernol, American, Blandol, Drakeol, Ervol, Gloria, Kaydol, Litetek, Lyondell (Duraprime 55, 70, 90, 200, 350, 400, etc), Marcol, Parol, Peneteck, Primol, Protol, Sontex, Witco brand white oils including RR-654-P and the like. Generally, plasticizing oils with average molecular weights less than about 200 and greater than about 700 may also be used (e.g., H-300 (1290 Mn)).</p><p>Comparisons of oil extended S-EB-S triblock copolymers have been described in Shell Chemical Company Technical Bulletin SC:1102-89 (April 1989) "KRATON herein by reference.</p><p>The crystal gels can be made non-adhearing, non-sticking, (non-tacky), by incorporating an advantage amount of stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), metal stearates (e.g., calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, etc.), polyethylene glycol distearate, polypropylene glycol ester or fatty acid, and polytetramethylene oxide glycol disterate, waxes, stearic acid and waxes, metal stearate and waxes, metal stearate and stearic acid. The use of stearic acid alone do not reduce tack. The amount of stearic acid is also important. As an example, ratio of 200 grams stearic acid to 2,000 gram of S-EB-S (a ratio of 0.1) will result in spotted tack reduction on the surface of the gel. A ratio of 250 to 2,000 will result in spotted crystallized stearic acid regions on the surface of the gel or spotted tack reduction. A ratio of 300 to 2,000 will result in complete tack reduction with large stearic acid crystallized regions on the surface of the gel. When microcrystalline waxes are incorporated together with stearic acid, the crystallization of stearic acid completely disappears from the surface of the gel. For example excellent result is achieved with 200 grams of stearic acid, 150 grams of microcrystalline wax and 2,000 grams of S-EB-S. The same excellent result is achieved when S-EB-S is adjusted to 3,000 grams, 4,000 grams, etc. The same result is achieved with (I) copolymers as well as in combination with polymers (II) such as SEPS, S-EB-EP-S, (S-EB-EP).sub.n, (SEB).sub.n, (SEP).sub.n polymers.</p><p>The crystal gels can also contain useful amounts of conventionally employed additives such as stabilizers, antioxidants, antiblocking agents, colorants, fragrances, flame retardants, flavors, other polymers in minor amounts and the like to an extend not affecting or substantially decreasing the desired properties.

The crystal gels can be casted unto various substrates, such as open cell materials, metals, ceramics, glasses, and plastics, elastomers, fluropolymers, expanded fluropolymers, Teflon (TFE, PTFE, PEA, FEP, etc), expanded Teflon, spongy expanded nylon, etc.; the molten crystal gel is deformed as it is being cooled. Useful open-cell plastics include: polyamides, polyimides, polyesters, polyisocyanurates, polyisocyanates, polyurethanes, poly(vinyl alcohol), etc. Suitable open-celled Plastic (sponges) are described in "Expanded Plastics and Related Products", Chemical Technology Review No. 221, Noyes Data Corp., 1983, and "Applied Polymer Science", Organic Coatings and Plastic Chemistry, 1975.

The crystal gels of the composites are formed from copolymers (I), polymers (II), and plasticizers (III) described above.</p><p>Sandwiches of crystal gel-material (i.e., crystal gel-material-crystal gel or material-crystal gel-material, etc.) are useful as dental floss, shock absorbers, acoustical isolators, vibration dampers, vibration isolators, and wrappers. For example the vibration isolators can be use under research microscopes, office equipment, tables, and the like to remove background vibrations. The tear resistance nature of the instant crystal gels are superior in performance to amorphous block copolymer gels which are much less resistance to crack propagation caused by long term continue dynamic loadings.</p><p>The crystal gels are prepared by blending together the components including other additatives as desired at about 23 C. forming a paste like mixture and further heating said mixture uniformly to about 150 blend is obtained. Lower and higher temperatures can also be utilized depending on the viscosity of the oils and amounts of multiblock copolymers (I) and polymer (II) used. These components blend easily in the melt and a heated vessel equipped with a stirrer is all that is required. Small batches can be easily blended in a test tube using a glass stirring rod for mixing. While conventional large vessels with pressure and/or vacuum means can be utilized in forming large batches of the instant crystal gels in amounts of about 40 lbs or less to 10,000 lbs or more. For example, in a large vessel, inert gases can be employed for removing the composition from a closed vessel at the end of mixing and a partial vacuum can be applied to remove any entrapped bubbles. Stirring rates utilized for large batches can range from about less than 10 rpm to about 40 rpm or higher.</p><p>The crystal gel articles can be formed by blending, injection molding, extruding, spinning, casting, dipping and other conventional methods. For example, Shapes having various cross-section can be extruded. The crystal gels can also be formed directly into articles or remelted in any suitable hot melt applicator and extruded into shaped articles and films or spun into threads, strips, bands, yarns, or other shapes. With respect to various shapes and yarn, its size are conventionally measured in denier (grams/9000 meter), tex (grams/1000 meter), and gage (1/2.54 cm). Gage, tex, denier can be converted as follows: tex=denier/9=specific gravity (2135/gage), for rectangular cross section, tex=specific gravity (5806 of the strip, both in centimeters.

Other conventional methods of forming the composition can be utilized.</p><p>Not only do the crystal gels have all the desirable combination of physical and mechanical properties substantially similar to high viscosity amorphous S-EB-S gels such as high elongation at break of at least 1,600%, ultimate tensile strength of about 8 higher, low elongation set at break of substantially not greater than about 2%, substantially about 100% snap back when extended to 1,200% elongation, and a gel rigidity of substantially from about 2 gram to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher, the crystal gels of the present invention exhibit improved tear resistance and resistance to fatigue not obtainable from amorphous S-EB-S gels at corresponding gel rigidities.</p><p>The crystal gels of the present invention exhibit one or more of the following properties. These are: (1) tensile strength of about 8 greater; (2) elongation of less than about 1,600% to about 3,000% and higher; (3) elasticity modules of about 10.sup.4 dyne/cm.sup.2 to about 10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2 and greater; (4) shear modules of about 10.sup.4 dyne/cm.sup.2 to about 10.sup.6 dyne/cm.sup.2 and greater as measured with a 1, 2, and 3 kilogram load at 23 less than about 2 gram Bloom to about 1,800 gram Bloom and higher as measured by the gram weight required to depress a gel a distance of 4 mm with a piston having a cross-sectional area of 1 square cm at 23 C.; (6) tear propagation resistance greater than the tear resistance of amorphous S-EB-S gels at corresponding gel rigidities; (7) resistance to fatigue greater than the fatigue resistance of amorphous S-EB-S gels at corresponding gel rigidities; (8) and substantially 100% snap back recovery when extended at a crosshead separation speed of 25 cm/minute to 1,200% at 23 measured at a crosshead separation speed of 25 cm/minute at 23</p><p>The crystal gel articles molded from the instant crystal gels have additional important advantages in that they end-use performance properties are greater than amorphous S-EB-S gels in that they are more resistant to cracking, tearing, crazing or rupture in flexural, tension, compression, or other deforming conditions of use. Like amorphous gels, the molded articles made from the instant composition possess the intrinsic properties of elastic memory enabling the articles to recover and retain its original molded shape after many extreme deformation cycles.</p><p>Because of their improved tear resistance and improved resistance to fatigue, the crystal gels of the present invention achieve greater performance than amorphous gels in low frequency vibration applications, such as viscoelastic layers in constrained-layer damping of mechanical structures and goods, as viscoelastic layers used in laminates for isolation of acoustical and mechanical noise, as anti-vibration elastic support for transporting shock sensitive loads, as vibration isolators for an optical table, as viscoelastic layers used in wrappings, enclosures and linings to control sound, as compositions for use in shock and dielectric encapsulation of optical, electrical, and electronic components.</p><p>Because of their improved tear resistance and improved resistance to fatigue, the crystal gels are more useful as molded shape articles for use in medical and sport health care, such use include therapeutic hand exercising grips, dental floss, crutch cushions, cervical pillows, bed wedge pillows, leg rest, neck cushion, mattress, bed pads, elbow padding, dermal pads, wheelchair cushions, helmet liner, cold and hot packs, exercise weight belts, traction pads and belts, cushions for splints, slings, and braces (for the hand, wrist, finger, forearm, knee, leg, clavicle, shoulder, foot, ankle, neck, back, rib, etc.), and also soles for orthopedic shoes. Other uses include various shaped articles as toys, optical uses (e.g., cladding for cushioning optical fibers from bending stresses) and various optical devices, as lint removers, dental floss, as tips for swabs, as fishing bate, as a high vacuum seal (against atmosphere pressure) which contains a useful amount of a mineral oil-based magnetic fluid particles, etc. Moreover, the casted, extruded, or spun threads, strips, yarns, tapes can be weaved into cloths, fine or coarse fabrics.</p><p>The crystal gels can be formed in any shape; the original shape can be deformed into another shape (to contact a regular or irregular surface) by pressure and upon removal of the applied pressure, the composition in the deformed shape will recover back to its original shape.</p><p>As an example of the versatility of use of the instant crystal gels, a hand exerciser can be made in any shape so long as it is suitable for use as a hand exerciser: a sphere shape, a cube shape, a rectangular shape, etc. Likewise, a wheelchair cushion can be made from the composition in any shape, so long as it meets the needs of the user of the cushion. For example, a cushion can be made by forming the composition into a selected shape matching the contours of the specific body part or body region. The composition can be formed into any desired shaped, size and thickness suitable as a cushion; the shaped composition can be additionally surrounded with film, fabric, foam, or any other desired material or combinations thereof. Moreover, the composition can be casted onto such materials, provided such materials substantially maintain their integrity (shape, appearance, texture, etc.) during the casting process. The same applies for brace cushions, liners, linings and protective coverings for the hand, wrist, finger, forearm, knee, leg, etc.</p><p>Because of their improved tear resistance and resistance to fatigue, the crystal gels exhibit versatility as balloons for medical uses, such as balloon for valvuloplasty of the mitral valve, gastrointestinal balloon dilator, esophageal balloon dilator, dilating balloon catheter use in coronary angiogram and the like. Since the crystal gels are more tear resistant, they are especially useful for making condoms, toy balloons, and surgical and examination gloves. As toy balloons, the crystal gels are safer because it will not rupture or explode when punctured as would latex balloons which often times cause injures or death to children by choking from pieces of latex rubber. The crystal gels are advantageously useful for making gloves, thin gloves for surgery and examination and thicker gloves for vibration damping which prevents damage to blood capillaries in the fingers and hand caused by handling strong shock and vibrating equipment.</p><p>Other uses include self sealing enclosures for splicing electrical and telephone cables and wires. For example, the crystal gels can be pre-formed into a small diameter tubing within an outer elastic tubing, both the internal crystal gel tubing and external elastic tubing can be axially expanded and fixed in place by a removable continuous retainer. Upon insertion of a spliced pair or bundle of cables or wires, the retainer can be removed, as the retainer is removed, the crystal gel and elastic tubing impinges onto the inserted cables or wires splices, thereby sealing the electrical splices against weather, water, dirt, corrosives and shielding the splice from external abuse. The enclosure is completed without the use of heat or flame as is conventionally performed.</p><p>Because of their improved resistance to tearing, the crystal gels do not tear as readily as amorphous gels when used as dental floss. The dental floss can be almost any shape so long as it is suitable for dental flossing. A thick shaped piece of the composition can be stretched into a thin shape and used for flossing. A thinner shaped piece would require less stretching, etc. For purposes of dental flossing, while flossing between two closely adjacent teeth, especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial contact points and more especially between two adjacent teeth with substantial amalgam alloy metal contact points showing no gap between the teeth, it is critical that the crystal gel resist tearing, shearing, and crazing while being stretched to a high degree in such situations. For example, dental crystal gel floss can take the form of a disk where the segments of the circumference of the disk is stretched for flossing between the teeth. Other shaped articles suitable for flossing include threads, strips, yarns, tapes, etc., mentioned above.</p><p>In order for crystal gels to be useful as a dental floss, it must overcome the difficult barriers of high shearing and high tearing under extreme elongation and tension loads. The difficulties that the crystal gels must overcome during flossing can be viewed as follows: during the action of flossing, the crystal gel is stretched from no less than about 200% to about 1,100% or higher, the crystal gel floss is deformed as it is pulled down with tearing action between the contacting surfaces of the teeth, then, the wedge of crystal gel floss is sheared between the inner contacting surfaces of the teeth, and finally, the elongated wedged of crystal gel floss is pulled upwards and out between the surfaces of the teeth. The forces encountered in the act of flossing are: tension, shearing, tearing under extreme tension.</p><p>The use of crystal gels advances the flossing art by providing strong, soft, and more tear resistant gels than amorphous gels. Floss made from the crystal gels has many advantages over conventional dental floss such as regular and extra fine waxed and unwaxed nylon floss, spongy nylon fiber floss, and waxed and unwaxed expanded and unexpended teflon floss. Such conventional floss are not recommended for use by children, since a slip or sudden snap in forcing the floss between the teeth may cause injury to the gums which often times results in bleeding. For sensitive gums and inflamed gums which has become red and puffy, it is difficult to floss at, near, and below the gumline. The soft crystal gel floss with softness substantially matching the softness of the gums are of great advantage for use by children and for flossing teeth surrounded by sensitive and tender gums.</p><p>In all cases, the tear strength of crystal gels are higher than that of amorphous gels. The rigidities of the crystal gels for use as dental floss advantageously should be selected to exhibit a propagating tear force (when propagating a tear as measured at 180 diameter mandrel attached to a spring scale) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 3 Kg/cm and higher. For any gel to be considered useful for flossing, the gels should exhibit tear strengths of at least 2 Kg/cm and higher, advantageously of at least 4 Kg/cm and higher, more advantageously of at least 6 Kg/cm and higher, exceptionally more advantageously of at least 8 Kg/cm and higher. Typically, the tear propagation strength should range from about 5 Kg/cm to about 20 Kg/cm and higher, more typically from about less than 5 Kg/cm to about 25 Kg/cm and higher, especially more typically form about less than 6 Kg/cm to about 30 Kg/cm and higher, and exceptionally more typically from about less than 8 Kg/cm to about 35 Kg/cm and higher.</p><p>For any gel to be considered useful for flossing, the gels, critically, should advantageously exhibit a propagating tension tear force (when a cylindrical sample is notched and a tear is initiated at the notched area and propagated past its maximum cylindrical diameter by length-wise stretching of the cylindrical sample) of at least about 1 Kg/cm, more advantageously at least 2 Kg/cm, and still more advantageously of about 4 Kg/cm and higher. Although the crystal gels of the present invention have improved tear resistance and resistance to fatigue greater than the amorphous gels at corresponding gel rigidities, the high and ultra-high tear resistant gels of my other related parent and c-i-p applications typically will exhibit even higher tear resistance values.</p><p>While advantageous components and formulation ranges based on the desired properties of the crystal gels have been disclosed herein. Persons of skill in the art can extend these ranges using appropriate material according to the principles discussed herein. All such variations and deviations which rely on the teachings through which the present invention has advanced the art are considered to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p><p>The invention is further illustrated by means of the following illustrative embodiments, which are given for purpose of illustration only and are not meant to limit the invention to
