load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p>Resins for powder coatings which are thermally and radiation curable
containing both olefinically unsaturated groups and at least one other
reactive group in the same molecule selected from epoxide groups and
acid or acid anhydride groups, a method for their preparation, and the
use thereof in powder coating compositions.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention relates to resins for powder coating compositions, especially thermally and
radiation curable resins, a process for their production, and their application in powder coatings,
especially for automotive topcoats.</p><p num="0002">In recent years, powder coatings have become increasingly popular in the coatings industry
because these coatings are inherently low in volatile organic content, which significantly reduces
emissions during the application process. Epoxy condensation polymers and acrylic resins (EP-A
0 509 393) have been used as film forming polymers for these coatings.</p><p num="0003">The use of powder coating compositions based on solid unsaturated resins which are radiation
or thermally curable has been described in EP-A 0 842 204. The use of unsaturated resins
prepared from acrylic polymers and radiation or thermally curable is known from US 6 384 102.
In both documents, just very few glycidyl groups are available for the curing reaction with
anhydride or acid groups or by reaction among each other (homopolymerisation).</p><p num="0004">The use in powder coating compositions of solid epoxy resins based on bisphenol A and
containing glycidyl groups, alone (leading to homopolymerisation) or in combination with resins
containing acid or anhydride groups, optionally in the presence of catalysts is well known as
state of the art.</p><p num="0005">The use in powder coating compositions of solid epoxidic cycloaliphatic hydroxyl group-containing
resins, alone or in combination with acid or anhydride groups containing resins is
reported in WO02/062867.</p><p num="0006">The use in powder coating compositions of solid saturated semi-crystalline polyanhydride resins
in combination with resins containing glycidyl groups is known from EP-A 0 509 393. </p><p num="0007">The use of solid unsaturated semi-crystalline polyanhydrides based on unsaturated diacids is
reported in US-A 5 019 379.</p><p num="0008">Coatings prepared from all such systems known from the prior art suffer from poor mar
resistance. Likewise, their chemical resistance needs improvement.</p><p num="0009">It is the object of the present invention to overcome these known shortcomings of the prior art.</p><p num="0010">The present invention concerns resins for powder coating compositions comprising at least one
resin containing olefinically unsaturated groups and in the same molecule further reactive groups
which are either epoxide groups or acid and/or groups. These resins are thermally and radiation
curable.</p><p num="0011">Resins containing olefinically unsaturated groups and epoxide groups are referred to hereinafter

the reciprocal of the so-called "unsaturation equivalent weight"); the SI unit is "mol/kg".</p><p num="0015">The solid acrylic resin <b>A1</b> containing epoxide and unsaturation groups can be obtained for
example by the reaction of a solid acrylic resin <b>A11</b> containing glycidyl groups with an
olefinically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid <b>A12</b> or an olefinically unsaturated acid anhydride
<b>A13</b>, such as acrylic, methacrylic, crotonic, or vinyl acetic acid, or half esters A14 of olefinically
unsaturated dicarboxylic acids like alkyl fumarate, maleate, or tetrahydro phthalate, with alkyl
groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 8, and especially preferred, from
1 to 4 carbon atoms, or acid anhydrides such as maleic or tetrahydro phthalic anhydrides. The
glycidyl groups containing solid acrylic resin <b>A11</b> can be prepared in the first step by
polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylate and other olefinically unsaturated monomers like for
example alkyl acrylate, methacrylate, maleate, or styrene with the addition of the usual thermal
initiators like peroxides or azo compounds with or without a solvent or other components. At the
end of the polymerisation, the glycidyl groups containing acrylic resin in the molten state is set
at a temperature of 120 to 190 °C and optionally, an antioxidant like phosphite or sterically
hindered phenol or a sterically hindered amine and/or a polymerisation inhibitor like
phenothiazine or a hydroquinone derivative (hydroquinone itself or its lower alkyl ethers) are
added in a quantity corresponding to a mass fraction of from 0,01 to 1 % with respect to the total
mass of the reactants of the second step. A catalyst of the reaction between glycidyl and acid or
acid anhydride groups can optionally be added. Examples of such catalysts include amines (e.g.
imidazoline), phosphines (e.g. triphenylphosphine), ammonium salts (e.g. tetrabutylammonium
bromide), phosphonium salts (e.g. triphenylethylphosphonium bromide). These catalysts are
preferably used in a mass fraction of from 0,05 to 1 % with respect to the total mass of the
reactants of the second step. Then the acid or acid anhydride group containing unsaturated
monomers selected from the group of compounds <b>A12</b> through <b>A14</b> are slowly added to the
molten resin in the second step of the reaction. The progression of the reaction is monitored for
example by determination of the acid number of the resulting polymer and of the other 
parameters like viscosity and residual amount of epoxide groups.</p><p num="0016">The solid cycloaliphatic resin <b>A2</b> containing hydroxyl, epoxide and unsaturated groups can be

olefinically unsaturated acid anhydride <b>A13</b>, such as acrylic, methacrylic, crotonic, or vinyl
acetic acid, or half esters <b>A14</b> of olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids like alkyl fumarate,
maleate, or tetrahydrophthalate, with alkyl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably
from 1 to 8, and especially preferred, from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or acid anhydrides such as maleic
or tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides.</p><p num="0017">The solid hydroxyl and epoxide group containing cycloaliphatic resin <b>A21</b> can be prepared in the
first step of the reaction by polyesterification of a first carboxylic acid <b>A211</b>, or a mixture of
such acids, or an anhydride, or a mixture of such anhydrides, selected from tetrasubstituted
tetrahydrophthalic acid or its anhydride, with the substituents R1 through R4 being chosen in
each case from H and CH<sub>3</sub>; a glycol <b>A212</b>, or a mixture of such glycols, of a general formula X-(OH)

to 55 carbon atoms, or a cycloaliphatic residue with from 2 to 55 carbon atoms, or an aromatic
radical with from 6 to 55 carbon atoms, and n is an integer between 2 and 4; and a second
carboxylic acid <b>A213</b> which is different from <b>A211</b>, or a mixture of such acids, with the formula
R- (C-OOH) <sub>m</sub> or an anhydride thereof, or a mixture of such anhydrides, where R is a linear or
branched alkyl with from 1 to 36 carbon atoms, a cycloalkane with from 5 to 36 carbon atoms,
a cycloalkene with from 5 to 36 carbon atoms or an aromatic residue with from 8 to 36 carbon
atoms, and m is an integer between 2 and 4; and where the amount of substance ratio between
<b>A211</b> and <b>A213</b> varies between 100 : 0 and 5 : 95 mol/mol, and in which the ratio of total
number of hydroxyl groups contained in <b>A212</b> and the total number of carboxyl groups
(anhydride groups being counted as two) in components <b>A211</b> and <b>A213</b> lies between 1,005 and
1,5. This polyester is then epoxidised using a peroxide compound, preferably in a solvent. Either
organic or inorganic peroxides can be used as suitable peroxide compounds. Peroxycarboxylic
acids such as peroxide compounds are used preferably, since monoperphthalic acid is especially 
preferred. Hydrogen peroxide was also found to be a preferred compound. The solvent is then
removed by distillation.</p><p num="0018">At the end of the distillation step the molten resin is cooled to a temperature from 130 to 190 °C
and optionally, an antioxidant like phosphite or sterically hindered phenol or a sterically hindered
amine and/or a polymerisation inhibitor like phenothiazine or a hydroquinone derivative as
defined supra are added in a quantity corresponding to a mass fraction of from 0,01 to 1 % with

reaction between epoxide and acid or acid anhydride groups can optionally be added. Examples
of such catalysts include amines (e.g. imidazoline), phosphines (e.g. triphenylphosphine),
ammonium salts (e.g. tetrabutylammonium bromide), phosphonium salts (e.g.
triphenylethylphosphonium bromide). These catalysts are preferably used in a mass fraction of
from 0,05 to 1 % with respect to the total mass of the reactants of the second step of the reaction.
Then the acid or acid anhydride group containing unsaturated monomers selected from the group
of compounds <b>A12</b> through <b>A14</b> are slowly added to the molten resin in the second step of the
reaction. The progression of the reaction is monitored for example by determination of the acid
number of the resulting polymer and of the other parameters like viscosity and residual amount
of epoxide groups.</p><p num="0019">The resin <b>A3</b> containing epoxide and unsaturated groups is preferably the result of the reaction
between a epoxy-phenoxy group containing resin <b>A31</b> with an olefinically unsaturated monocarboxylic
acid <b>A12</b> or an olefinically unsaturated acid anhydride <b>A13</b>, such as acrylic,
methacrylic, crotonic, or vinyl acetic acid, or half esters <b>A14</b> of olefinically unsaturated
dicarboxylic acids like alkyl fumarate, maleate, or tetrahydrophthalate, with alkyl groups having
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 8, and especially preferred, from 1 to 4 carbon
atoms, or acid anhydrides such as maleic or tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides. The resin <b>A31</b> can
be based on bisphenol A epoxy resins <b>A311</b>, and epoxy resins <b>A312</b> based on phenol novolaks,
and epoxy resins <b>A313</b> based on cresol novolaks. The bisphenol A based epoxy resins <b>A311</b> can
be prepared in the first step of the reaction via a TAFFY process from bisphenol A and
epichlorohydrin, wherein the excess of epichlorohydrin determines the number average molar
mass of the epoxy resin, or in the so-called advancement process where bisphenol A is reacted 
with the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. The phenol and cresol novolaks <b>A321</b> and <b>A331</b> used
as starting compounds can be prepared in a well-known manner by the acid-catalysed
condensation of formaldehyde with either phenol or cresol, or mixtures thereof. Epoxy groups
are introduced by reaction of the novolaks with epichlorohydrin. Commercially available epoxy
resins, such as ®Epikote 3003 from Resolution Deutschland GmbH, ®DER 664 from DOW
Chemical etc. are typical examples of epoxide group containing polyphenoxy resins <b>A31</b> that can
be utilised for the preparation of the unsaturation containing polyphenoxy resins A3. For the
preparation of the resin <b>A3</b> in the second step of the reaction, an epoxy resin selected from the
group consisting of <b>A31</b> through <b>A33</b> is heated to a temperature of from 120 to 170 °C,
optionally an antioxidant like a phosphite or a sterically hindered phenol or a sterically hindered
amine and/or a radical polymerisation inhibitor like phenothiazine or a hydroquinone derivative
as defined supra can be added in a quantity corresponding to a mass fraction of from 0,01 to 1 %
with respect to the total mass of the reactants of the second reaction step. A catalyst of the
reaction between epoxide and acid or acid anhydride groups can optionally be added. Examples
of such catalysts include amines (e.g. imidazoline), phosphines (e.g. triphenylphosphine),
ammonium salts (e.g. tetrabutylammonium bromide), and phosphonium salts (e.g. triphenylethylphosphonium
bromide). These catalysts are preferably used in a mass fraction of from 0,05 to
1 % with respect to the total mass of the reactants of the second step. Then, in the second step
of the reaction, the acid or acid anhydride group containing unsaturated monomers selected from
the group of compounds <b>A12</b> through <b>A14</b> are slowly added to the molten resin. The progression
of the reaction is monitored for example by determination of the acid number of the resulting
polymer and of the other parameters like viscosity and residual amount of epoxide groups.</p><p num="0020">A further object of the invention are resins for powder coating compositions which are thermally

customary unit is "mg/g". A partial acid number is determined in a sample containing groups that
hydrolyse under formation of acid groups, by reaction of the sample with a monofunctional
alcohol, and subsequent neutralisation of the half ester formed with potassium hydroxide.</p><p num="0022">A resin is designated here as semi-crystalline if it has a mass fraction of at least 10 % which is
crystalline, i. e which exhibits a change in density upon dilatometric analysis at the crystalline

reduced pressure until the reaction mass is virtually free of acetic anhydride. It is also possible
to modify the polyanhydrides by adding hydroxycarboxylic acids which are incorporated into
the polycondensate. Such hydroxycarboxylic acids preferably have a melting temperature of

same resin leads to superior properties when compared to a mixture of two resins having only 
one functionality each which is different from the functionality of the other.</p><p num="0069">Thus, a mixture of an epoxy functional resin and an unsaturated resin as binder (see reference test
3 and 4) leads to poor performance of the coating when compared to a coating prepared with a
binder having both functionalities in the same resin.</p><p num="0070">The powder coating compositions prepared with the powder coating resin compositions
according to this invention are not only solid, but if compared with the only radiation or only
thermally cured, see test number 1 and 2, in comparison to test number 3 radiation and thermally
cured, are better in all the performances.</p><p num="0071">And if compared with mixture of unsaturated resin with glycidyl containing resins show
improved mechanical and mar resistance see reference tests 3 and 4 in comparison to test number
8.</p><p num="0072">While satisfactory results can be achieved in dual cure with mixtures of resins of different
functionalities with regard to solvent resistance (see reference test 3 and 4), chemical resistance,
mechanical properties and mar resistance are poor in these cases. Quite surprisingly, chemical
resistance is markedly improved while retaining the favourable solvent resistance results if both
functionalities are combined in the same molecule. A further improvement is possible especially
with regard to the mechanical and mar resistance when the irradiation step in the dual cure is
repeated, cf. tests 7 through 12.</p><p num="0073">That is a really surprising result, and because of the excellent and balanced properties in all of
the four performance fields, the coating compositions prepared in accordance with the present
invention can be advantageously used especially for automotive coating applications.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>Resins for powder coatings which are thermally and radiation curable containing both
