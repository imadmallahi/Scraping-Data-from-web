More specifically, this invention relates to adhesive compositions comprising thermoplastic resins and epoxy resins. The invention also provides a method of preparing adhesive compositions and adhesive articles and uses thereof.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Adhesive composition blends of curable epoxy resins with various thermoplastic polymers are known. For example, adhesive compositions comprising epoxy and polyester thermoplastic resins have been used as hot melt adhesives and in the manufacture of structural bonding and sealing tapes.</p><p>However, adhesive compositions consisting of epoxy resins and thermoplastic polyesters have several deficiencies. For example, they can be prone to excessive flow prior to or during cure, unless flow control additives are incorporated. This excessive flow may result in a messy adhesive bond line that must be smoothed out in a subsequent step in cases where appearance is important (for example, exterior automotive applications such as trim adhesion, body panel and door skin replacement). Additionally, excessive flow can form gaps in the bond line which may lead to bond failure due to moisture penetration or corrosion. Also, those epoxy-polyester adhesive compositions that have been formulated not to undergo excessive flow typically lack sufficient tack to be used in the form of a thermosettable pressure-sensitive tape without incorporation of additional ingredients or a separate adhesive layer. Further, in order to obtain tack and good adhesion to painted metal substrates it is often necessary to increase the epoxy content of the adhesive composition above that level which otherwise achieves optimal properties.</p><p>Thermally curable compositions of epoxy resins having ethylene-vinyl acetate (also called "EVA" herein) copolymer particles dispersed therein have also been disclosed as toughened epoxy resins containing a dispersed phase of EVA polymerized in situ.</p><p>Epoxy material containing compositions having thermal curatives or hardeners such as those described above are difficult to melt process into articles (for example, tapes, films, or rods) without causing premature curing of the composition. Use of high temperature curatives that do not cause curing during such processing steps requires a high cure temperature during formation of the adhesive bond, which can cause excessive flow of the adhesive during cure thereby resulting in an aesthetically unpleasant or structurally defective bond or thermal damage on the case of thermally sensitive substrates.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The invention provides curable compositions formed by mixing components comprising:</p><p>a) from about 20 to about 80 weight percent of a curable epoxy resin;</p><p>b) from about 20 to about 80 weight percent of a thermoplastic ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resin; and</p><p>c) an effective amount of a photocatalyst for the curable epoxy resin such that the total of components a) and b) is 100 percent and, wherein the compositions are free from hydrocarbon polyolefins and are homogeneous mixtures.</p><p>The compositions of the invention, exclusive of additives, form homogeneous and single phased molten mixtures and resulting uncured solids, for example, unsupported films.</p><p>The compositions of the invention may also contain up to 50 percent by volume, preferably up to 30 percent by volume, of the total composition of various additives such as fillers, tackifiers, and the like.</p><p>In another aspect, the invention describes a method comprising the steps of:</p><p>a) providing a homogeneous molten mixture comprising a curable epoxy resin, a thermoplastic ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resin; and an effective amount of a photocatalyst for the curable epoxy resin, wherein the composition is free from hydrocarbon polyolefins;</p><p>b) applying the mixture to a substrate or processing into an unsupported film; and</p><p>c) at any subsequent time, activating the photocatalyst to cure the epoxy containing material.</p><p>If necessary, the compositions may be heated to accelerate cure or to ensure complete cure.</p><p>The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of polyester-epoxy and thermally cured EVA-epoxy adhesives by providing compositions having significant tack in the uncured state, good cured adhesion to surface treated (for example, E-coated) metals, low controlled flow during curing and desirable physical properties of the cured resin (structural adhesive and cohesive strength, and paintability). The improved tack of the adhesive in the uncured state keeps the adhesive in place during assembly and minimizes the need for the use of clamps during the cure step. Further, the present invention provides bonding tapes characterized by good tack, limited mass flow and structural bond strength (that is, &amp;gt;1000 psi (6.9 mega Pascals (Mpa)) overlap shear strength) and can be processed on a 100 percent solids basis without the use of solvents typically used in the art.</p><p>The adhesive compositions of the invention are free from, that is, do not contain, hydrocarbon polyolefin resins. "Hydrocarbon polyolefin resin" refers to a fully prepolymerized uncrosslinked polymeric hydrocarbon bearing essentially no organic functional groups, prepared from homopolymerization and/or copolymerization of an olefinic monomer(s). Such resins are typically incompatible with epoxy resins and will cause phase separation of compositions containing an appreciable amount of epoxy resin. Examples of such resins include polyethylene, polypropylene, and the like, and poly(ethylene-co-propylene), poly(propylene-co-1-butene), and the like.</p><p>A "tape" is defined as an uncured adhesive film attached to either a release liner or a backing that can be formed into a roll or cut into pieces and having a length greater than its width.</p><p>An "unsupported film" is defined as an uncured adhesive film having adhesive characteristics that may be tacky or not tacky at ambient temperature.</p><p>A "curable" or "uncured" composition is a composition that remains thermoplastic and melt processable and substantially uncrosslinked until subjected to either heat, light, or a combination of both at which time the composition polymerizes and/or crosslinks to form a thermoset material.</p><p>A "protected film" is an uncured adhesive film having a release liner or backing attached that can be formed into a roll or cut into pieces and having a length that is substantially the same as its width.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p>The adhesive compositions of the invention comprise from about 20 to about 80, preferably 30 to 70, more preferably 40 to 60 weight percent of an epoxy containing material, from about 20 to about 80, preferably from about 30 to about 70, more preferably from about 40 to about 60, weight percent ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and an effective amount of a photocatalyst for the curable epoxy containing material, the weight percent being based on the total weight of epoxy resin and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and the compositions are free of hydrocarbon polyolefin resins.</p><p>Epoxy resins useful in the adhesive compositions of the invention are any organic compounds having at least one oxirane ring, that is, ##STR1## polymerizable by a ring opening reaction. Such materials, broadly called epoxides, include both monomeric and polymeric epoxides and can be aliphatic, alicyclic, heterocyclic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic and can be combinations thereof. They can be liquid or solid or blends thereof, blends being useful in providing tacky adhesive films. These materials generally have, on the average, at least two epoxy groups per molecule and are also called "polyepoxides." The polymeric epoxides include linear polymers having terminal epoxy groups (for example, a diglycidyl ether of a polyoxyalkylene glycol), polymers having skeletal oxirane units (for example, polybutadiene polyepoxide), and polymers having pendent epoxy groups (for example, a glycidyl methacrylate polymer or copolymer). The molecular weight of the epoxy resin may vary from about 74 to about 100,000 or more. Mixtures of various epoxy resins can also be used in the hot melt compositions of the invention. The "average" number of epoxy groups per molecule is defined as the number of epoxy groups in the epoxy resin divided by the total number of epoxy molecules present.</p><p>Useful epoxy resins include those which contain cyclohexene oxide groups such as the epoxycyclohexane carboxylates, typified by 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate, 3,4-epoxy-2-methylcyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxy-2-methycyclohexane carboxylate, and bis(3,4-epoxy-6-methylcyclohexylmethyl) adipate. For a more detailed list of useful epoxides of this nature, reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 3,117,099, incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Further epoxy resins which are particularly useful in the practice of this invention include glycidyl ether monomers of the formula: ##STR2## where R' is aliphatic, for example, alkyl, aromatic, for example, aryl, or combinations thereof, and n is an integer of 1 to 6. Examples are the glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols obtained by reacting a polyhydric phenol with an excess of chlorohydrin such as epichlorohydrin, for example, the diglycidyl ether of 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenol)propane (Bisphenol A). Further examples of epoxides of this type which can be used in the practice of this invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,018,262, incorporated herein by reference. Preferred epoxy resins include diglycidyl ethers of Bisphenol A and hydrogenated bisphenol A-epichlorohydrin based epoxy resins.</p><p>There is a host of commercially available epoxy resins which can be used in this invention. In particular, epoxides which are readily available include octadecylene oxide, epichlorohydrin, styrene oxide, vinylcyclohexene oxide, glycidol, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A (for example, those available under the trade designations "EPON 828", "EPON 1004", and "EPON 1001F" from Shell Chemical Co., and "DER-332" and "DER-334", from Dow Chemical Co.), diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol F (for example, those under the trade designations "ARALDITE GY281" from Ciba-Geigy Corp., and "EPON 862" from Shell Chemical Co.), vinylcyclohexane dioxide (for example, having the trade designation "ERL-4206" from Union Carbide Corp.), 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexene carboxylate (for example, having the trade designation "ERL-4221" from Union Carbide Corp.), 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-5,5-spiro-3,4-epoxy) cyclohexane-metadioxane (for example, having the trade designation "ERL-4234" from Union Carbide Corp.), bis(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) adipate (for example, having the trade designation "ERL-4299" from Union Carbide Corp.), dipentene dioxide (for example, having the trade designation "ERL-4269" from Union Carbide Corp.), epoxidized polybutadiene (for example, having the trade designation "OXIRON 2001" from FMC Corp.), epoxy silanes, for example, beta-3,4-epoxycyclohexylethyltrimethoxy silane and gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane, commercially available from Union Carbide, flame retardant epoxy resins (for example, having the trade designation "DER-542", a brominated bisphenol type epoxy resin available from Dow Chemical Co.), 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (for example, having the trade designation "ARALDITE RD-2" from Ciba-Geigy), hydrogenated bisphenol A-epichlorohydrin based epoxy resins (for example having the trade designation "EPONEX 1510" from Shell Chemical Co.), and polyglycidyl ether of phenol-formaldehyde novolak (for example, having the trade designation "DEN-431 " and "DEN-438" from Dow Chemical Co.).</p><p>Catalysts</p><p>Catalysts of the present invention preferably are activated by photochemical means, such as by actinic radiation (radiation having a wavelength in the ultraviolet or visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum). Useful photocatalysts are of two general types: onium salts and cationic organometallic salts, both described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,948, incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Onium salt photoinitiators for cationic polymerizations include iodonium and sulfonium complex salts. Useful aromatic iodonium complex salts are of the general formula: ##STR3## wherein Ar.sup.1 and Ar.sup.2 can be the same or different and are aromatic groups having from 4 to about 20 carbon atoms, and are selected from the group consisting of phenyl, thienyl, furanyl, and pyrazolyl groups;</p><p>Z is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur, and a carbon--carbon bond, ##STR4## wherein R can be aryl (having from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, such as phenyl) or acyl (having from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, such as acetyl, or benzoyl), and ##STR5## wherein R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl radicals having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, and alkenyl radicals having from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms;</p><p>m is zero or 1; and</p><p>X has the formula DQ.sub.n, wherein D is a metal from Groups IB to VIII or a metalloid from Groups IIIA to VA of the Periodic Chart of the Elements (Chemical Abstracts version), Q is a halogen atom, and n is an integer having a value of from 1 to 6.

The aromatic groups may also be substituted, if desired, by one or more non-basic groups if they are essentially non-reactive with epoxide and hydroxyl functionalities.</p><p>Useful aromatic iodonium complex salts are described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,828, which is incorporated herein by reference. The preferred aromatic iodonium complex salts are (Ar).sub.2 I PF.sub.6 and (Ar).sub.2 I SbF.sub.6.</p><p>The aromatic iodonium complex salts useful in the invention are photosensitive only in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. However, they can be sensitized to the near ultraviolet and the visible range of the spectrum by sensitizers for known photolyzable organic halogen compounds. Illustrative sensitizers include colored aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,250,053, incorporated herein by reference. Suitable sensitizers should be chosen so as to not interfere appreciably with the cationic cure of the epoxy resin in the adhesive composition.</p><p>Aromatic sulfonium complex salt initiators suitable for use in the invention are of the general formula: ##STR6## wherein R.sub.3, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 can be the same or different, provided that at least one of the groups is aromatic. These groups can be selected from the group consisting of aromatic moieties having from 4 to about 20 carbon atoms (for example, substituted and unsubstituted phenyl, thienyl, and furanyl) and alkyl radicals having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms. The term "alkyl" includes substituted alkyl radicals (for example, substituents such as halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, and aryl). Preferably, R.sub.3, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 are each aromatic; and</p><p>Z, m, and X are all as defined above with regard to the iodonium complex salts.</p><p>If R.sub.3, R.sub.4, or R.sub.5 is an aromatic group, it may optionally have one or more fused benzo rings (for example, naphthyl, benzothienyl, dibenzothienyl, benzofuranyl, dibenzofuranyl, etc.).

Useful sulfonium salts are described more fully in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,256,828 and 4,173,476.</p><p>Aromatic sulfonium complex salts useful in the invention are typically photosensitive only in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum.

No. 5,436,063, although this is optional. Oxalate co-catalysts that can be used include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,694. The accelerator comprises from about 0.01 to about 5 weight percent, preferably from about 0.1 to about 4 weight percent of the adhesive composition based on the combined weight of the epoxy resin and the thermoplastic ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer.</p><p>Ethylene Vinyl Acetate Copolymer</p><p>The thermoplastic component of the invention includes and preferably, consists essentially of one or more thermoplastic ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resins. Useful ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers of the present invention are thermoplastic and contain at least 28 percent by weight vinyl acetate, preferably at least 40 percent by weight vinyl acetate, more preferably at least 50 percent by weight vinyl acetate, and even more preferably at least 60 percent by weight vinyl acetate by weight of the copolymer. Useful ranges of vinyl acetate weight percents include from 28 to 99, generally from 40 to 90, preferably from 50 to 90, and more preferably from 60 to 80 weight percent vinyl acetate in the copolymer. The useful ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers may contain up to 99 percent by weight vinyl acetate.</p><p>Non-limiting examples of commercially available ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers that may used in practice of the present invention include ELVAX™ 210, 250, 260, and 265 (E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, Del.), and AT Plastics 2820M EVA copolymer (AT Plastics, Inc., Brampton, Ontario, Canada) (28 weight percent vinyl acetate); ELVAX™ 150 and AT Plastics 3325M EVA copolymer (33 weight percent vinyl acetate); ELVAX™ 40W and LEVAPREN™ 400 (Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.), AT Plastics 4030M (40 weight percent vinyl acetate); LEVAPREN™ 450, 452, and 456 (45 weight percent vinyl acetate; LEVAPREN™ 500HV (50 weight percent vinyl acetate), LEVAPREN™ 600 HV (60 weight percent vinyl acetate); LEVAPREN™ 700 HV (70 weight percent vinyl acetate); LEVAPREN™ KA 8479 (80 weight percent vinyl acetate), and the like.</p><p>The components used to form the adhesive compositions of the invention are compatible in the molten state. "Compatible" means that the molten mixture of at least the epoxy and thermoplastic components is single phased, that is, does not visibly phase separate among the individual components and forms a homogeneous molten and resulting solid mixture. Of course, one skilled in the art can easily vary the concentrations of the epoxy resins, EVA copolymers and vinyl acetate content therein, and catalysts to form compositions of the invention without undue experimentation. For example, one skilled in the art would generally increase the vinyl acetate concentration of the EVA copolymer as the concentration epoxy containing material in the composition increases so to maintain a singled phased composition in the molten state.</p><p>The specific physical properties of the cured adhesive may also be tailored to suit the specific application by adjusting the ratio of the preceding components. Generally, increased tack and adhesion to high energy surfaces, and a decreased tendency to flow during cure is achieved by increasing the relative amount of EVA copolymer in the formulation. Additionally, tack of the composition may be affected by the amount of plasticization of the EVA copolymer by a liquid epoxy resin. The amount of photocatalyst is selected to optimize cure speed and uniformity of through cure. Thus, the relative amounts of the above-mentioned ingredients are balanced depending on the properties sought in the final composition.</p><p>Hydroxyl Containing Material</p><p>Optionally, the adhesive compositions of the invention may further comprise a hydroxyl-containing material. The hydroxyl-containing material may be any liquid or solid organic material having hydroxyl functionality of at least 1, preferably at least 2. The hydroxyl-containing organic material should be free of other "active hydrogen" containing groups such as amino and mercapto moieties. The hydroxyl-containing organic material should also preferably be devoid of groups which may be thermally or photochemically unstable so that the material will not decompose or liberate volatile components at temperatures below about 100 when exposed to the energy source during curing. Preferably the organic material contains two or more primary or secondary aliphatic hydroxyl groups (that is, the hydroxyl group is bonded directly to a non-aromatic carbon atom). The hydroxyl group may be terminally situated, or may be pendant from a polymer or copolymer. The number average equivalent weight of the hydroxyl-containing material is preferably about 31 to 2250, more preferably about 80 to 1000, and most preferably about 80 to 350. More preferably, polyoxyalkylene glycols and triols are used as the hydroxyl-containing material. Even more preferably, cyclohexane dimethanol is used as the hydroxyl-containing material.</p><p>Representative examples of suitable organic materials having a hydroxyl functionality of 1 include alkanols, monoalkyl ethers of polyoxyalkylene glycols, and monoalkyl ethers of alkylene glycols.</p><p>Representative examples of useful monomeric polyhydroxy organic materials include alkylene glycols (for example, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2-ethyl-1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol, 1,18-dihydroxyoctadecane, and 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol), polyhydroxyalkanes (for example, glycerine, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, and sorbitol) and other polyhydroxy compounds such as N,N-bis(hydroxyethyl)benzamide, butane-1,4-diol, castor oil, and the like.</p><p>Representative examples of useful polymeric hydroxyl-containing materials include polyoxyalkylene polyols (for example, polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene glycols and triols of equivalent weight of 31 to 2250 for the diols or 80 to 350 for triols), polytetra-methylene oxide glycols of varying molecular weight, hydroxyl-terminated polyesters, and hydroxyl-terminated polylactones.</p><p>Useful commercially available hydroxyl-containing materials include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,063, incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>The amount of hydroxyl-containing organic material used in the compositions of the invention may vary over a broad range, depending on factors such as the compatibility of the hydroxyl-containing material with both the epoxy resin and the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer component, the equivalent weight and functionality of the hydroxyl-containing material, and the physical properties desired in the final cured adhesive composition. Typically, the amount of hydroxyl containing material in compositions of the invention range from 0 to about 25 percent by weight of the epoxy containing material in the composition.</p><p>The optional hydroxyl-containing material is particularly useful in tailoring the glass transition temperature and flexibility of the compositions of the invention. As the equivalent weight of the hydroxyl-containing material increases, the flexibility of the hot melt make coat correspondingly increases although there may be a consequent loss in cohesive strength. Similarly, decreasing equivalent weight may result in a loss of flexibility with a consequent increase in cohesive strength. Thus, the equivalent weight of the hydroxyl-containing material is selected so as to balance these two properties.</p><p>As explained more fully hereinbelow, the incorporation of hydroxyl containing materials, specifically polyether polyols, into the compositions of the invention is especially desirable for adjusting the rate at which the adhesive compositions cure upon exposure to energy. Useful polyether polyols (that is, polyoxyalkylene polyols) for adjusting the rate of cure include polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene glycols and triols having an equivalent weight of about 31 to 2250 for the diols and about 80 to 350 for the triols, as well as polytetramethylene oxide glycols of varying molecular weight and polyoxyalkylated bisphenol A's.</p><p>The relative amount of the optional hydroxyl-containing organic material is determined with reference to the ratio of the number of hydroxyl groups to the number of epoxy groups in the composition. That ratio may range from 0:1 to 1:1, more preferably from about 0.4:1 to 0.8:1. Larger amounts of the hydroxyl-containing material increase the flexibility of the composition but with a consequent loss of cohesive strength. If the hydroxyl containing material is a polyether polyol, increasing amounts will further slow the curing process.</p><p>Additives</p><p>Optionally, the adhesive compositions of the invention further comprise up to about 50 percent, preferably, up to 30 percent, by total volume of various additives such as fillers, stabilizers, plasticizers, tackifiers, flow control agents, cure rate retarders, adhesion promoters (for example, silanes and titanates), adjuvants, additives, and the like, such as silica, glass, clay, talc, pigments, colorants, glass beads or bubbles, glass or ceramic fibers, antioxidants, and the like, so as to reduce the weight or cost of the composition, adjust viscosity, and provide additional reinforcement or modify the thermal conductivity of the adhesives compositions and articles of the invention so that a more rapid or uniform cure may be achieved.</p><p>Adhesive compositions of the invention may be made electrically conductive, or their resistivity can be lowered to a desired level by the inclusion of electrically conductive filler agents. Such materials include metals, metal-alloys, graphite, etc. in forms such as particles, spheres, flakes, fibers, whiskers, wovens, or non-wovens. Polymeric, ceramic, glass, or other non-conductive materials in the above forms that have an electrically-conductive coating or layer, or that are doped with salts or electrolytes may also be useful fillers for this purpose. Intrinsically conductive organic polymers or other materials may also be used. The choice of filler type, shape, volume percentage loading, etc. can be made according to known methods in order to render the adhesive film isotropically conductive or anistropically (z-axis) conductive depending on the intended application.</p><p>Some of the materials above also exhibit useful thermal conductivity and can be used in appropriate quantities to render films of the invention thermally conductive. Or, where it is desired that the film be thermally conductive but electrically insulating, useful fillers include ceramics such as aluminum oxide, glass, boron nitride, zinc oxide, and non-ceramics such as diamond. These materials may be used in the some of the same forms as those listed above for electrically conductive materials.</p><p>The various additives are not included in the foregoing weight percent calculations for the adhesive composition.</p><p>Method of Making</p><p>The adhesive compositions of the invention can be prepared by using either a batch or a continuous process as long as the components are compatible in the melt phase, that is, no visible phase separation among the components.</p><p>In a batch process, the adhesive compositions of the invention are prepared by mixing the various ingredients in a suitable vessel, preferably one that is not transparent to actinic radiation, at an elevated temperature sufficient to liquefy the components so that they can be efficiently mixed with stirring until the components are thoroughly melt blended but without thermally degrading or causing premature curing of the materials. The components may be added simultaneously or sequentially, although it is preferred to first blend (in order) the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and epoxy-containing material and followed by the addition of the photocatalyst for the epoxy containing material.</p><p>In a continuous process, the adhesive compositions of the invention are mixed in an extruder as above, for example a twin screw extruder, equipped with a down stream port, a static mixer, and an appropriate output orifice (film die, sheet die, profile die, etc.) and a take-up roll and wind up roll(s), as appropriate. Take-up line speed is adjusted as appropriate for the output form.</p><p>Compositions may be used directly after melt blending (in a molten form) or may be packaged as a solvent free system in pails, drums, cartridges or other suitable containers, preferably in the absence of light, until ready for use. The compositions so packaged may be delivered to a hot-melt applicator system with the use of pail unloaders, cartridge dispensers, and the like. Alternatively, the adhesive compositions of the invention may be delivered to conventional bulk hot melt applicator and dispenser systems in the form of sticks, pellets, slugs, blocks, pillows or billets for use in continuous processes.</p><p>It is also possible to provide the adhesive compositions of the invention as uncured, unsupported adhesive films. Such films are useful in laminating operations and are preferably not tacky.</p><p>If the adhesive composition is tacky, it may be provided as a tape, wherein the adhesive composition is provided in film or layer form and rolled up into a roll with a release liner (for example, silicone-coated Kraft paper), with subsequent packaging in a bag or other container that is not transparent to actinic radiation.</p><p>Use</p><p>The molten adhesive compositions of the invention may be applied to a wide variety of substrates by extruding, spraying, gravure printing, or coating, (for example, by using a coating die, a heated knife blade coater, a roll coater or a reverse roll coater). Alternatively, the adhesive composition may be applied to a substrate in the form of an uncured adhesive film which, if necessary, can be die cut to a predefined shape. Once applied, the adhesive film composition may be tacky or tack-free, a blend of liquid and solid epoxy-containing materials being useful in achieving the former state.</p><p>Substrates which can be coated or bonded using compositions of the invention include plastics, metals, ceramics, glass and cellulosic materials although primed, bare, or painted metal substrates such as aluminum, cold rolled steel and porcelainized steel are particularly preferred.</p><p>Curing of the adhesive composition begins upon exposure of the composition to any source emitting actinic radiation (that is, radiation having a wavelength in the ultraviolet or visible spectral regions) and continues for a period of time thereafter. Suitable sources of radiation include mercury, xenon, carbon arc, tungsten filament lamps, sunlight, etc. Ultraviolet radiation, especially from a medium pressure mercury arc lamp, is most preferred. Exposure times may be from less than about 1 second to 10 minutes or more (to provide a total energy exposure of about 800 milliJoules/square centimeter (mJ/cm.sup.2)) for onium salt catalysts depending upon both the amount and the type of reactants involved, the radiation source, the distance from the radiation source, and the thickness of the composition to be cured. The rate of curing tends to increase with increasing amounts of photoinitiator at a given light exposure or irradiation. The rate of curing also increases with increased radiation intensity.</p><p>Those adhesive compositions that include a polyether polyol that retards the curing rate, are particularly desirable when bonding together two substrates that are not transparent to the radiation. After applying the adhesive composition to the first substrate and irradiating the composition, the second substrate may be bonded to the first substrate for a certain period of time (for example, from about 2 minutes to about 4 hours) until the composition has sufficiently cured that a useful bond can no longer be made. Thus, it will be recognized that the presence of the polyether polyol provides the adhesive compositions with an open time. That is, for a period of time (the open time) after the composition has been irradiated, it remains sufficiently uncured for a second substrate to be bonded thereto. The adhesive compositions of the invention which do not include a polyether polyol may be applied to a single substrate and irradiated to provide an adhesive coating on the substrate.</p><p>The second substrate is typically bonded using heat, pressure or both heat and pressure, (for example, with a heated press, heated nip rollers, or a heated laminator). Depending on the particular adhesive composition, the conditions for applying the second substrate may range from a few seconds at 177 exposures are for about 10 seconds at 138 of about 274 kiloPascals (kPa) are useful. In another approach, for example, when cationic organometallic catalysts are used, a free standing film may be irradiated on one or both sides and then placed between two substrates followed by the use of heat, pressure or both heat and pressure to bond the film to the two substrates.</p><p>Alternatively, two substrates may be bonded together if one of the substrates is transparent to the radiation, thereby permitting the adhesive composition to be irradiated through the transparent substrate.</p><p>Once the adhesive composition is exposed to radiation, the curing process is initiated. Subsequent to radiation exposure the adhesive compositions can be tack-free, or can be tacky for a limited period of time but eventually achieving a tack-free condition. Full cure may be achieved under ambient conditions in about 24 hours or as little as about 8 to 16 hours, depending upon the intensity of the radiation source, the radiation exposure time, the concentration of the photoinitiator, and the particular ingredients which comprise the adhesive composition.</p><p>The time to reach full cure may be accelerated by post curing the compositions with heat, such as in an oven. The time and temperature of the post cure will vary depending upon the concentration and type of the photoinitiator, the radiation exposure conditions, and the like. Typical post cure conditions for onium salt type catalysts range from 5 to 15 minutes at about 50 to about 100 organometallic catalysts is from about 15-35 minutes at a temperature of about 177 heat and pressure to bond two substrates together such as when using a heated press, a heated laminator or heated nip rollers.</p><p>Articles</p><p>Adhesive articles according to the invention may be readily prepared in many ways. For example, the ingredients for the adhesive composition may be melted and stirred in a suitable mixing vessel (for example, a batch mixer, an extruder, etc.) at an elevated temperature low enough to avoid decomposing any photocatalyst present in the adhesive composition. After mixing, the adhesive composition may be formed into its final shape by a variety of different methods. For example, the adhesive composition can be coated onto a release liner to form a tape using a heated knife coater. Alternatively, the adhesive composition ingredients may be compounded in an extruder and then extruded through a die having a desired profile to produce a shaped strip of adhesive; that is, a strip having the desired cross-sectional shape.</p><p>In another approach, the composition can be extruded as a mass and delivered between a pair of motor-driven chilled rolls spaced apart a predetermined distance to form a flat sheet of the adhesive composition that may be subsequently calendared to the desired thickness.</p><p>A structure can be imparted to a major surface of the adhesive layer by extruding the adhesive sheet between a pair of nip rolls, at least one of which is embossed with the desired pattern. A sheet of the adhesive composition can also be embossed at any subsequent time by heating the sheet (if necessary) and pressing the sheet with an embossing roll (which may be heated or unheated) carrying the desired pattern.</p><p>In one preferred method of manufacture, an actinic radiation blocking release liner is laminated to a film of the uncured adhesive composition to protect the exposed surfaces of the uncured adhesive film from premature exposure to actinic radiation and then converted into the desired final form, (that is, tape, or protected film). This can be accomplished by, for example, slitting it to the desired width, and winding it up into roll form and around a suitable plastic or paper core if needed. Alternatively, the tape or protected film can be slit or otherwise cut into discrete lengths or die cut into desired shapes. Of course, an article can also be prepared by laminating or attaching any type of backing, for example, cloth, polymer, nonwoven, etc., to the adhesive film of the invention.</p><p>It is also necessary to protect the composition from premature activation, for example, during storage and shipping. When in the form of protected films, unsupported films, or tapes, this may be accomplished, for example, by storing the entire tape-bearing construction in a radiation-blocking container. The invention will now be described further by way of the following non-limiting examples.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>Unless otherwise specified the materials used in these examples may be obtained from standard commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemical Co. of Milwaukee, Wis.

An adhesive composition was prepared according to General Procedure B using the following amounts of ingredients: LEVAPREN™ 70011V (44.5 parts), EPON™ 828 epoxy resin (44.5 parts), aluminum oxide (10.0 parts), CpXylFe.sup.+ SbF.sub.6.sup.- (1.0 part).</p><p>Two pieces of 30.5 cm appropriate for making a hem flange bond. For the piece that makes the inner part of the hem, 1.9 cm was bent up to an angle of about 45 degrees. For the outer part of the hem, 1.3 cm was bent up past perpendicular to an angle of about 120 degrees. Both bends were made to run the long way on the panel. Strips of the bulk adhesive were cut and pressed between silicone coated polyester release liner to about 0.38 mm. Strips of tape (2.54 cm width) were cut from this for bonding. The tape was exposed through the liner for three minutes on each side using two 40 Watt 1.2 meter Super Diazo Blue Fluorescent lights (Philips TL 40W/03) at a distance of about 10 cm.</p><p>The panels were prepared by wiping the bond area with Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner No.-08984. The tape was then wrapped around the inner part of the hem so that the tape would bond to both the show-side of the outer panel and under the hem. The tape showed the right amount of tack and conformability to hold itself to the metal and wrap easily around the edge. The inner panel was inserted into the hem, which was pounded down tight against the inner panel, completing the hem flange. The tape was cured using a heat gun, heating both sides of the bond along the entire length of the bond for a total of about 15 minutes. The entire assembly was allowed to cool. Upon cooling, the adhesive squeeze out was inspected for indications of the extent of cure. The adhesive had hardened so that a thumb nail could not penetrate it. This indicated that an adequate cure had been achieved.</p><heading>Example 22</heading><p>The adhesive composition of Example 20 was prepared according to General Procedure B for the preparation of adhesives. After removal of the composition from the BRABENDER mixer, the material was stretched out into a rope and allowed to cool to room temperature. Care was taken to avoid deleterious exposure of the material to ambient light, thereby preventing premature curing of the adhesive. A single screw extruder with a 2.54 cm width adjustable ribbon die set at about 0.38 mm gap was attached to the BRABENDER mixer. The rope of material was fed into the extruder, and the extrudate was wound around a core using a double sided release liner. The tape was allowed to cool to room temperature and was then ready for use.</p><p>Other embodiments are within the following claims.
