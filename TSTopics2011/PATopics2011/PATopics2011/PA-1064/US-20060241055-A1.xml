No. 09/992,124, filed Nov. 19, 2001, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0003"> 1. Field of the Invention </p><p num="p-0004"> The present invention relates to peptides which affect the biological activity of cells in culture. In particular, the invention is directed to specific peptides affecting adherence, growth or secretion of cells. </p><p num="p-0005"> 2. Description of Relevant Art </p><p num="p-0006"> Tissue and protein hydrolysates have been routinely used as a source of peptides in cell culture media since the late 1800's. They are the most common undefined culture media component in present use in bacteriology and often replace serum in the mammalian culture (S. Saha and A. Sen., <i>Aptavirol </i>33:338-343, 1989). Hydrolysates and serum are not optimal sources of peptides for culture media. Further, their composition are undefined, vary from lot to lot and may harbor pathogens such as BSE. </p><p num="p-0007"> It has been recognized that peptides are generally preferred nutrients for use in cell culture media as compared to their constituent amino acids. Several approaches have been taken in an effort to determine which specific peptides are utilized by a cell culture as a means for identifying defined peptides which affect growth or some other biological activity. For example, recent developments in peptide synthesis technology have made it possible to screen large numbers of compounds for media enhancement, either as individual defined sequences or as a mixture of variable sequences in a peptide library. The library approach has provided an opportunity to screen more peptide sequences for desired biological effects in cell culture. Once the sequence of a peptide having the desired biological activity is identified, it may be produced in large quantity, such as by chemical synthesis or recombinant DNA methods. Subsequently, the peptide can be included in a culture system by coating on a surface or being free in solution in the culture medium. Both presentations may lead to a desired effect on cultured cells. </p><p num="p-0008"> The ability of cells to interact with components of the extracellular matrix in vivo is involved in several important biological processes including cellular growth, migration, and differentiation. Moreover, the necessity of anchorage-dependent cells to first adhere to surfaces largely dictates the success of a cell culture effort. In particular, the abilities of the cell to adhere, spread, and contract on solid matrices are prerequisites for the growth of normal anchorage-dependent cells in vitro. (Grinnell, F., Psychology, 53:67-149, 1978 and Couchman, et al., J.Cell Biol., 93:402-410, 1982) The ability of cells to adhere to surfaces is affected by many factors including the cell culture media used, the particular type of cell, and the particular surface upon which the cells are cultured. When the end goal is to accumulate product in the supernatant, and the cells being cultured are adherent-type cells, best results are typically achieved when adherence and growth are optimized first, followed by an optimization of expression and finally secretion. </p><p num="p-0009"> In general, mammalian cells are cultured on polymer surfaces. Practically all mammalian cells that adhere to synthetic polymer surfaces are controlled by absorbed protein and are receptor mediated. For example, fibronectin is a protein component of the extracellular matrix which has been shown to be involved in the adhesion of mammalian cell types to tissue culture substrates. (Pearlstein, E., Nature, 262:497-500, 1976 and Kleinman, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 72:426-432, 1976) The ability of fibronectin to aid in cell attachment has been localized to a trimer sequence (RGD), which is located in the cell binding domain of fibronectin. </p><p num="p-0010"> Regarding the role of a cell culture substrate and other surfaces in promoting cell adhesion, it is known that proteins are immediately absorbed to the surface of a tissue culture substrate following placement of a protein solution thereon. Provided there are receptors for some of the absorbed proteins on the cell surface, and further provided that the conformation of the absorbed protein is not altered to a large degree by absorption so as to destroy ligand-receptor affinity, cell adhesions to the culture substrate and cell spreading can result. </p><p num="p-0011"> With further reference to the role of the cell culture substrate and other surfaces in permitting cell adhesion, if cells are seeded on a substrate in the absence of absorbed protein, then proteins which are on the cell surface may directly absorb to the surface and the cell will, provided suitable conditions are present, secrete protein towards the surface in the form of an extracellular matrix. However, it is known that cells in culture never directly touch the surface except through intermediate absorbed protein. </p><p num="p-0012"> It has been proposed that particular peptides are absorbed to a polymer surface in order to promote short-term cell adhesion to the surface. For example, Singer et al. proposed the absorption of a 13-mer peptide containing the RGD sequence described above onto a polymer substrate to promote cell adhesion. (Singer, et al., J. Cell Bio., 104:573-584, 1987) The disadvantages of using peptides of this length have been that they are highly suseptible to degradation at high temperatures such as those used during cell culture and to the proteolytic action of the cultured cells themselves. </p><p num="p-0013"> An alternative to surface absorption of peptides to promote cell adhesions, has been to chemically attach peptides via covalent modifications to a surface. For example, Brandly, et al., (Analytical Biochemistry 173:270, 1988) proposed the inclusion of a 9-mer peptide in a polymer substrate to promote cell adhesions. While this method promoted cell adhesions, its required large concentrations of peptide to promote an acceptable level of cell adhesion. Given that the cost of preparing synthetic peptides is high, incorporation of peptides to the bulk of the polymer would not facilitate the economical preparation of cell culture substrates commercially. </p><p num="p-0014"> It is also known to derivatize surfaces with peptides having less than 12 amino acid residues and containing one of the following sequences of amino acids: GRGD, GYIGSR, GREDV. These peptides have been further described as including a minimal cell-surface receptor recognition sequence, for example, RGD, YIGSR, or REDV to permit the cell receptor mediated support of cells to a treated surface. The peptides are preferably attached to the surface through the reaction of a terminal primary amine associated with the peptide to be grafted to the surface and an active group on the polymer surface. A disadvantage of this method is that the surface must first be activated before the surface can be derivatized with a peptide. The process used for activating the surface can be lengthy in time and can involve reagents which may be toxic to cells, requiring thorough washing of the surface prior to modification with the peptide and prior to culturing of the cells on the derivatized surface. Further, the efficiency of peptide immobilization is highly dependent on the prior polymer derivatization process. The final range of peptide concentration and orientation on the surface are restricted. </p><p num="p-0015"> Thus, a need exists in the art for the discovery of additional small peptides for use in modifying surfaces to promote cell adhesions and growth which are thermally stable and resistant to proteolysis by cellular proteases or proteases such as trypsin which are often added to remove adherent-type mammalian cells from a tissue culture substrate. It is further desired that the small peptides are resistant to the desorptive effect, but not require covalent immobilization to the surface. </p><p num="p-0016"> There is also a need in the art for small peptides that enhance expression and secretion. Adherent cell lines are often the choice for production when the target pharmaceutical is secreted. Having an immobilized cell allows one to easily remove the high molecular weight constituents, which are present in the supernatant and required during the growth phase, and to subsequently replace the supernatant with a stabilizing media containing only low molecular weight substances that will not co-purify with the target pharmaceutical. Unfortunately, these stabilizing media often reduce expression and secretion levels. Having low molecular weight peptides that increase accumulation of product in tissue culture broth would therefore be advantageous. </p><p num="p-0017"> Finally, there is a need for peptide libraries which accelerate the discovery of media or culture environment constituents with the attributes described above. The ability to match peptide performance with physical properties will lead to peptide classes delivering benefits across many cell types and culture conditions. Further, such peptide classes will allow bioengineers to rapidly identify high-performing bioactive peptides as media constituents for cells in rare supply, such as stem cells. </p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0018"> The present invention provides peptides identified as having cell growth and/or and secretion enhancing properties.

Inventive peptides were identified in an intitial maximum diversity library (MDL-100) and a follow-up MDL-400 library comprised of compounds filling in the property space coarsely covered by the MDL-100. Biological effect on the cells is compared in the presence and absence of the inventive peptides and in presence and absence of extracellular matrix (ECM) controls and known peptide controls. The absorbance at 590 nm is a measure of relative oxygen consumption, which correlates with cell growth.</p><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0032"> By the term “enhancing secretion”, “promoting secretion”, and the like, it is meant that the level of a target molecule in the supernatant medium is greater in the presence of one or more of the inventive peptides relative to in its absence. This effect may be related to a number of factors including, but not limited to, changes in protein expression levels and intracellular trafficking. </p><p num="p-0033"> Two initial peptide maximum diversity libraries, MDL-400 and MDL-100 and a follow-up library comprised of compounds related to early leads were constructed using conventional peptide synthesis techniques. The candidate peptides in the follow-up library were selected by “Nearest Neighbor” techniques. They were subsequently screened for biologically active peptides exhibiting certain desired characteristics. One goal of the present work was to identify peptides which when non-covalently attached or non-specifically adsorbed to a surface could increase cell growth as measured by an increase in oxygen consumption of the cultured cells, where the increase in oxygen consumption was measured by use of an oxygen biosensor. A second goal was to identify peptides enhancing secretion. In particular, a cell line secreting platelet derived growth factor was selected and supernatant levels of PDGF were monitored by a sandwich ELISA. The MDL libraries were first screened for their effect on PDGF secretion and then additional leads were found in a follow-up library comprised of Nearest Neighbors.

After the monolayer was established, a chemically defined base media and a single test peptide were added to each well. In the present work, secretion of PDGF was assessed in the presence and absence of peptides from the library by collecting supernatant from each well and performing an ELISA specific for PDGF on the supernatant.

The selected cells were anchorage-dependent MC3T3 cells, which were grown on tissue culture surfaces which had been pre-coated with peptides of the present invention. The screening medium used to evaluate peptides in the library was a low serum medium allowing evaluation of peptide effects with low interference from undefined materials present in the medium. In the present work, growth of MC3T3 cells was assessed in the presence and absence of the peptides in the library which were present in the form of a dried film on a tissue culture substrate. Growth was evaluated in a basal medium rich in amino acids and containing the necessary vitamins, metals and simple carbon source. After an appropriate incubation time, growth of each peptide-supplemented culture is compared to growth of the unsupplemented culture. The extent of growth was evaluated using a Becton Dickinson oxygen sensor to detect oxygen consumption by the cells.

In particular, as described in further detail below, each of these peptides, when adsorbed to a surface, produced a significant difference in growth as compared to cells grown on an uncoated surface. </p><p num="p-0042"> Two inventive peptide compositions were further identified to have growth enhancing properties. These compositions were selected during screening of a library designated MDL-100. The specific pairs of peptides identified were the following: (a) SEQ ID NO:12/SEQ ID NO:13 and (b) SEQ ID NO:14/SEQ ID NO:15. </p><p num="p-0043"> Canonical peptides or isomers have the same amino acid composition and only the sequence varies. When multiple canonical peptides are found to create an enhancement, a broad non-specific mechanism is implied.

Based on this growth screening, FKFIG (SEQ ID NO: 5) and two other members of the canonical set, IFFKG (SEQ ID NO: 1) and FIKFG (SEQ ID NO: 2) were found to be positive. The results are shown in Tables 1, 3, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The results identify a new class of compounds useful for cell culture. </p><p num="p-0044"> As described above, the present invention provides a peptide which enhances cell growth and/or secretion in a cell culture system, wherein the peptide includes a structure of at least one of (a) xxxkx, (b) xxkxx, (c) xxxxk, (d) xkxxx, and (e) kxxxx, wherein k is represents lysine and each x may be the same or different amino acid independently selected from the group consisting of lysine, alanine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, proline, valine, glycine, glutamine, leucine, methionine, asparagine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine and derivatives thereof. </p><p num="p-0045"> It is well within the contemplation of the present invention that peptides of the invention which promote cell growth and/or secretion in a cell culture system may contain greater than five amino acid residues, provided that they include within their sequence a structure corresponding to at least one of (a) xxxkx, (b) xxkxx, (c) xxxxk, (d) xkxxx, and (e) kxxxx described above, wherein k represents lysine and each x may be the same or different amino acid independently selected from the group consisting of lysine, alanine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, proline, valine, glycine, glutamine, leucine, methionine, asparagine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine and derivatives thereof. It is noted, however, that care must be given to the action of endogenous and exogenous proteases within the culture system. Such proteases are more likely to degrade peptides of longer length which may include protease cleavage sites within their sequence. Moreover, whole proteins or large peptides are more susceptible to degradation. </p><p num="p-0046"> It is noted that pentapeptides according to the present invention would be generally free of internal protease cleavage sites. However, with respect to the desirable methods for producing the peptides of the invention, it would be particularly desirable to select peptides that include C-termini or N-termini corresponding to the C-termini and N-termini produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of proteins in traditional culture media hydrolysates. For example, the inventive peptide QVVAK(SEQ ID NO:4) does not have an internal trypsin site but does possess a C-terminal lysine which can be leveraged to manufacture the peptide economically as a concatemer in numerous recombinant production systems known in the art. As contactemers may contain hundreds of copies of the coding sequence. Concatemer nucleic acid constructs encoding peptides of the invention with C-termini and N-termini which are subject to enzymatic or chemical cleavage, produce polypeptides comprising repeating subunits of the peptide amino acid sequence separated by convenient cleavage sites. Cleavage using the appropriate enzymatic or chemical means releases the peptide monomer. This approach to manufacture increases the yield of the desired peptide and decreases manufacturing costs. Post-expression processing is simplified due to the cleavage site made available by cloning of the concatemer structure. </p><p num="p-0047"> The invention also encompasses a peptide which enhances cell growth and/or secretion, the peptide comprising a structure of at least one of (a) xxxkx, (b) xxkxx, (c) xxxxk, (d) xkxxx, and (e) kxxxx, wherein each x may be the same or different hydrophobic or uncharged polar amino acid residue and k represents lysine.

Boc chemistry may also be used as well as synthesis on a variety of different solid supports, “tea-bag” synthesis (Houghten), and split and divide combinatorial methods. Solution phase methods for peptide synthesis may also be used. </p><p num="p-0049"> As an alternative to chemical synthesis, the peptides of the present invention can be produced more economically using recombinant methods. For recombinant production, the peptide sequence is first converted to a corresponding nucleic acid sequence which encodes the amino acid sequence of the peptide. This may be an RNA sequence which is subsequently translated to produce the peptide, or it may be a DNA sequence which is then cloned into an expression vector under the control of a promoter which enables the transcription of the DNA sequence and subsequence translation of the mRNA to produce the peptide. Many such methods for recombinant production of the desired peptide or protein sequence are well known to the practitioner and may be applied to the production of the peptides of the invention without the exercise of inventive skill. The peptides may be purified, if necessary, also using standard methods for physical, chemical and affinity separation which are well known to the practitioner. </p><p num="p-0050"> Useful peptides of the invention may include modifications to the C-terminus, (e.g., amides and esters), the N-terminus (e,g., acetyl groups) and non-naturally occurring amino acids as will be described in further detail below, (e.g. norleucine). Such modifications may have an effect on peptide activity. Moreover, modifications may provide a means for covalent attachment to a carrier or linker molecule. </p><p num="p-0051"> The peptides of the invention may be included in tissue culture media prepared for prokaryotes and yeast, as well as cultured cells and tissues derived from vertebrates and invertebrates to produce a desired effect on the cells, such as increased adherence, growth and/or expression and secretion. The base culture medium to which the peptide is added may be a chemically defined medium or a complex medium containing undefined components such as fetal calf serum or yeast hydrolysates. However, chemically defined or semi-defined media are preferred, as the peptide of the invention are most advantageously used as a means for reducing or eliminating performance variability due to undefined media components and for reducing or eliminating animal-derived components in the media used to produce pharmaceutical products. </p><p num="p-0052"> It is within the ordinary skill in the art to determine an appropriate concentration of an inventive peptide in a selected culture medium or coating solution. In one embodiment, the peptide is introduced into a cell culture system at a concentration of about 500 μM to about 6 mM. In a further embodiment, the peptide is introduced into a cell culture system at a concentration of about 250 μM to about 24 mM. In yet another embodiment, the peptide is introduced into a cell culture system at a concentration ranging from 3 mM to about 12 mM. Moreover, multiple peptides may be added to a culture medium or to a solution for coating a surface to produce a synergistic effect (if those have the same effect on the cells) or to produce multiple effects (if each peptide has a different effect on the same cells). </p><p num="p-0053"> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the ability of the peptides of the present invention to enhance cellular adherence, growth, expression or secretion may be affected by the base culture medium and/or the presence of other medium components.

Typically, and preferably, peptides of the present invention may be used as components of culture medium to culture cells in vitro. In particular, the present invention can be practiced to culture animal, (more preferably mammalian, avian or insects), plant, bacterial, protozoan, fungal, or yeast cultures. In addition, the culture medium can be one that is used to package viruses or bacteriophage in host cells. A culture medium according to the present invention may also be useful for culturing a primary cell (e.g., to grow beta-islet cells for insulin production). Other uses for a medium containing the peptide of the present invention, include use in the culture of cells that have been genetically engineered to express recombinant peptides or protein. Finally, the culture medium can be a liquid, semi-solid or solid culture medium. Preferably, the culture medium is a liquid medium. </p><p num="p-0054"> The peptides of the invention may be dissolved in a carrier such as water to produce a solution for coating tissue culture substrate or other surfaces for growth of anchorage-type cells. For example, a solution containing one or more peptides of the invention may be distributed onto a surface and dried in a reverse airflow hood that results in a peptide being present on the surface in the form of a dried film. </p><p num="p-0055"> In one embodiment of the present invention, the peptide increases oxygen consumption of cells. For example, peptides of the invention, when adsorbed to a surface in the form of a dried film, were found to enhance cell growth when compared to growth obtained on uncoated surfaces as measured by an increase oxygen consumption of the cells. Peptides of the invention may enhance growth of cells in vitro or in vivo. For example, tissue culture surfaces may be treated to enhance the growth of the cells in vitro or, alternatively, peptides may enhance the growth of cells in vivo on the surface of an implanted biomedical device. </p><p num="p-0056"> In a further embodiment, cells are selected from the group including, but not limited to, the following: epithelial, endothelial, dermal, neural, tumor, lymphocytic, stem cells, and combinations thereof.

In another embodiment, the peptide and one of the proteins described above are applied simultaneously, either free or as a conjugate to the surface. </p><p num="p-0058"> The growth enhancing peptides of the present invention are suitable for promoting adherence and growth of a variety of anchorage-dependent cells on surfaces, including two dimensional or three dimensional surfaces. For example, the surface may be that of a bioreactor which allows cells to attach in 3-D arrays. More efficient bioreactors than presently exist can be designed by attaching the cells to 3-D surfaces modified with the inventive peptides. </p><p num="p-0059"> With specific reference to the types of surfaces which may be used in the practice of the present invention, suitable surfaces would include, but are not limited to, ceramic, metal or polymer surfaces.

Glass surfaces may include glycerol propylsilane bonded glass. </p><p num="p-0060"> According to one specific embodiment of the invention, the peptide can be bound to a carrier. A precondition for selection of a suitable carrier molecule is that the functional biological activity of the peptides should not be impaired either by the carrier or by the coupling process. Carrier molecules for the purposes of the invention can belong to varied classes of substances, including, but not limited to, protein components of the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Moreover, the peptide may be covalently linked to more defined substances including, but not limited to, polylysine, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet haemocyanin, immunoglobulin, polysaccharide, lipoprotein, growth factors, and any combinations thereof.

With reference to suitable growth factors for chemical couplings with the peptides of the present invention, these include, but are not limited to, bFGF, GCSF, an ILGF-1, or VEGF. In addition, the peptides of the invention may be conjugated to a synthetic polymer, e.g. polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol, to phospholipids including ceramics or paraffin and to alcohols, such as glycerol. </p><p num="p-0061"> The chemical coupling between the peptides of the invention and any one of the class substances described above is generally affected directly via reactive groups of the carrier substance and the peptide or with the aid of the linkers. For example, the bi-functional linker sulphosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate may be used to couple peptides of the invention to a suitable growth factor or extracellular matrix protein. Reactive groups may be already present on the carrier and the peptide. However, they can also be introduced by activating a reactive group in the molecule. Common reactive functionalities include amino, imino, hydroxyl, sulphohydryl or carboxyl groups. </p><p num="p-0062"> It is noted that it may be advantageous to conjugate more than one peptide molecule to a particular carrier in order to facilitate enhanced adhesion and growth promoting properties. </p><p num="p-0063"> In one embodiment of the invention, the carrier member of the conjugate is adsorbed to a particular surface, such as a tissue culture surface. For example, the carrier may be an extracellular matrix protein adsorbed to the surface and contained a reactive functionality to provide for binding or conjugation to a peptide or peptides of the invention, such as by reaction with a non-natural amino acid at either the N-terminus or C-terminus of the peptides. In this instance, the modified peptide is added to a tissue culture substrate which has already been precoated with a carrier containing a reactive functionality.

In particular, the surface-treated biomedical implant devices enhance the amount and rate of cell adhesions to the surface, as well as growth and therefore the rate of tissue integration of the device in vivo. Moreover, the enhanced adherence and growth of the cells provides a continuous protective layer between the biomedical device and the biological tissue to prevent entry of bacteria and other infectious agents into the tissue.

The method of modifying surfaces using the system of the present invention would also be useful in the design of a mammalian cell bioreactor, since it provides a stable integral surface component which allows for support of cell adhesion and cell growth without the absolute requirement of medial cell adhesion molecules such as fibronectin and collagen.

Growth is monitored with an oxygen biosensor assay as described above. The absorbance readout at 590 nm provides a measure of relative oxygen consumption of the cells which correlates with cell growth.
