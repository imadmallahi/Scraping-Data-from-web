polymerization of macromers. In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of
such matrices for such purposes as cell immobilization, tissue adherence, and
controlled drug delivery.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0003">Matrices are polymeric networks characterized by insolubility in water. One
type of polymeric matrix is a hydrogel, which can be defined as a water-containing
polymeric network. The polymers used to prepare hydrogels can be based on a
variety of monomer types, such as those based on methacrylic and acrylic ester
monomers, acrylamide (methacrylamide) monomers, and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone. To
form the gel, these monomer classes are typically crosslinked with such crosslinking
agents as ethylene dimethacrylate, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, methylenebis(4-phenyl
isocyanate), ethylene dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene, and allyl methacrylate.</p><p num="0004">Another type of polymeric network can be formed from more hydrophobic
monomers and/or macromers. Matrices formed from these materials generally
exclude water. Polymers used to prepare hydrophobic matrices can be based on a
variety of monomer types such as alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, and polyester-forming
monomers such as ε-caprolactone and lactide. When formulated for use in an
aqueous environment, these materials do not need to be crosslinked, but they can be
crosslinked with standard agents such as divinyl benzene. Hydrophobic matrices can
also be formed from reactions of macromers bearing the appropriate reactive groups 
such as the reaction of diisocyanate macromers with dihydroxy macromers, and the
reaction of diepoxy-containing macromers with dianhydride or diamine-containing
macromers.</p><p num="0005">Although there exist a variety of methods for producing polymeric networks,
when these networks are intended to be created in the presence of viable tissue, and/or
to contain a bioactive compound, the number of acceptable methods of producing
polymeric networks is extremely limited.</p><p num="0006">It is nevertheless desirable to form both hydrogel and non-hydrogel polymeric
matrices in the presence of viable tissue or bioactive agents for the purposes of drug
delivery, cellular immune isolation, prevention of post-surgical adhesions, tissue
repair, and the like. These polymeric matrices can be divided into two categories:
biodegradable or bioresorbable polymer networks and biostable polymer networks.</p><p num="0007">Biodegradable polymeric matrices have been previously suggested for a
variety of purposes, including controlled release carriers, adhesives and sealers.
When used as controlled release carriers, for instance, polymeric matrices can contain
and release drugs or other therapeutic agents over time. Such matrices can be formed,
for instance, by a number of different processes, including solvent casting
hydrophobic polymers. Solvent casting, however, typically involves the use of
organic solvents and/or high temperatures which can be detrimental to the activity of
biological materials and can complicate production methods. Solvent casting of
polymers out of solution also results in the formation of uncrosslinked matrices. Such
matrices have less structure than crosslinked matrices and it is more difficult to
control the release of bioactive agents from such matrices. Yet another process, which
involves the polymerization of monomers in or around the desired materials, suffers
from cytotoxicity of monomers, oxygen inhibition and heat of polymerization
complications.</p><p num="0008">Another process used in the past to prepare biodegradable and biostable
hydrogels involves the polymerization of preformed macromers using low molecular
weight initiators. This process involves a number of drawbacks as well, however,
including toxicity, efficacy, and solubility considerations. For instance, when using a 
macromer solution containing a low molecular weight soluble initiator to encapsulate
viable cellular material, the initiator can penetrate the cellular membrane and diffuse
into the cells. The presence of the initiator may involve some toxic consequence to
the cells. When activated, however, these initiators produce free radicals having
distinct cytotoxic potential. Other drawbacks arise if the initiator is able to diffuse out
of the formed matrix, thereby producing toxicity and other issues. Such initiators also
tend to aggregate in aqueous solution, causing efficiency and reproducibility
problems. Finally, in view of the limited efficiency of many initiators for initiating
the necessary radical chain polymerization, it is often necessary to add one or more
monomeric polymerization "accelerators" to the polymerization mixture. Such
accelerators tend to be small molecules capable of penetrating the cellular membrane,
and often raise cytotoxic or carcinogenic concerns.</p><p num="0009">U.S. Patent Nos. 5,410,016 (Hubbell, et al.) and 5,529,914 (Hubbell, <i>et.al</i>.) for
instance, relate to hydrogels prepared from biodegradable and biostable polymerizable
macromers. The hydrogels are prepared from these polymerizable macromers by the
use of soluble, low molecular weight initiators. Such initiators can be combined with
the macromers, and irradiated in the presence of cells, in order to form a gel that
encapsulates the cells.</p><p num="0010">Hydrogels often suffer from similar or other drawbacks in use as biological
adhesives or sealants, e.g., for use as tissue adhesives, endovascular paving,
prevention of post-surgical adhesions, etc. In each of the applications, the hydrogel
matrix must generally "adhere" to one or more tissue surfaces. Current methods rely
upon physical "adhesion" or the tendency of hydrogels to "stick" to a surface. A
superior adhesive would provide both physical and chemical adhesion to surfaces
utilizing the same physical characteristics as current hydrogel adhesives, but also
providing chemical, covalent coupling of the matrix material to the tissue surface.
Covalent bonds are generally much stronger than physical adhesive forces, such as
hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.</p><p num="0011">As described above, when various techniques are used to form polymeric
matrices via photoinitiation of macromers, the photoinitiators utilized tend to be low 
molecular weight. Polymeric photoinitiators have been described as well, although
for applications and systems quite distinct from those described above. See, for
instance, "Radical Polymerization", C.H. Bamford, pp. 940-957 in Kroschwitz, ed.,
<i>Concise Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering,</i> 1990. In the subsection
entitled "Photosensitized Initiation: Polymeric Photosensitizers and Photoinitiators",
the author states that "[p]olymeric photosensitizers and photoinitiators have been
described. Many of these are polymers based on benzophenone, e.g., poly(p-divinylbenzophenone)
(DVBP). Such rigid polymers are reported to be effective
sensitizers since hydrogen abstraction from the backbone by excited benzophenone is
less likely."</p><p num="0012">U.S. Patent No. 4,315,998 (Neckers) describes polymer-bound
photosensitizing catalysts for use in the heterogeneous catalysis of photosensitized
chemical reactions such as photo-oxidation, photodimerization, and photocyclo
addition reactions. The polymer-bound photosensitizing catalysts are insoluble in
water and common organic solvents, and therefore can be readily separated from the
reaction medium and reaction products by simple filtration.</p><p num="0013">What is clearly needed are macromers and macromer systems that avoid the
problems associated with conventional polymeric matrices, and in particular, those
drawbacks that arise when polymeric matrices are formed in the presence of viable
tissue or bioactive agents.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0014">The present invention provides a crosslinkable macromer system comprising
two or more polymer-pendent polymerizable groups and one or more polymer-pendent
initiator groups. In a preferred embodiment, the polymerizable groups and the
initiator group(s) are pendent on the same polymeric backbone. In an alternative
preferred embodiment, the polymerizable groups and initiator group(s) are pendent on
different polymeric backbones.</p><p num="0015">In the first embodiment, the macromer system comprises a polymeric
backbone to which are covalently bonded both the polymerizable groups and initiator 
group(s). Pendent initiator groups can be provided by bonding the groups to the
backbone at any suitable time, e.g., either prior to the formation of the macromer (for
instance, to monomers used to prepare the macromer), or to the fully formed
macromer itself. The macromer system itself will typically comprise but a small
percentage of macromers bearing both initiator groups and polymerizable groups.
The majority of macromers will provide only pendent polymerizable groups, since the
initiator groups are typically sufficient if present at far less than 1:1 stoichiometric
ratio with macromer molecules.</p><p num="0016">In an alternative preferred embodiment, the macromer system comprises both
polymerizable macromers, generally without pendent initiator groups, in combination
with a polymeric initiator. In either embodiment, the initiator will be referred to
herein as a "polymeric initiator", by virtue of the attachment of such initiator groups
to a polymeric backbone.</p><p num="0017">Macromer systems of the present invention, employing polymeric initiators,
provide a number of unexpected advantages over the use of polymerizable macromers
and separate, low molecular weight initiators. Such systems, for instance, provide an
optimal combination of such properties as nontoxicity, efficiency, and solubility.
Solubility, for instance, can be improved by virtue of the ability to control the aqueous
or organic solubility of the polymerizable macromer by controlling the backbone.
Toxicity can also be improved, since the polymeric initiators of this invention
typically cannot diffuse into cells in the course of immobilization.</p><p num="0018">In a preferred embodiment, the pendent initiator groups are selected from the
group consisting of long-wave ultra violet (LWUV) light-activatable molecules such
as; 4-benzoylbenzoic acid, [(9-oxo-2-thioxanthanyl)-oxy]acetic acid, 2-hydroxy
thioxanthone, and vinyloxymethylbenzoin methyl ether; visible light activatable
molecules; eosin Y, rose bengal, camphorquinone and erythrosin, and thermally
activatable molecules; 4,4' azobis(4-cyanopentanoic) acid and 2,2-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)
propane] dihydrochloride. An important characteristic of the initiator
group being the ability to be coupled to a preformed macromer containing
polymerizable groups, or to be modified to form a monomer which can take part in the 
macromer synthesis, which is subsequently followed by the addition of polymerizable
groups.</p><p num="0019">In such an embodiment, the pendent polymerizable groups are preferably
selected from the group consisting of pendent vinyl groups, acrylate groups,
methacrylate groups, ethacrylate groups, 2-phenyl acrylate groups, acrylamide groups,
methacrylamide groups, itaconate groups, and styrene groups.</p><p num="0020">In a further preferred embodiment, the polymeric backbone is selected from
the group consisting of synthetic macromers, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),
polyethylene oxide (PEO), and polyethylene glycol (PEG); derivatizable naturally
occurring polymers such as cellulose; polysaccharides, such as hyaluronic acid,
dextran, and heparin; and proteins, such as collagen, gelatin, and albumin.</p><p num="0021">The macromer of the present invention can be used in a variety of applications,
including controlled drug release, the preparation of tissue adhesives and sealants, the
immobilization of cells, and the preparation of three-dimensional bodies for implants.
In one aspect, for instance, the invention provides a method for immobilizing cells,
the method comprising the steps of combining a polymeric initiator of the present
invention with one or more polymerizable macromers and in the presence of cells,
under conditions suitable to polymerize the macromer in a manner that immobilizes
the cells.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p num="0022">As used herein the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed

one or more polymers providing pendent polymerizable and initiator groups. Groups

non-polymerizable) comprising one or more initiator groups and optionally containing
one or more other thermochemically reactive groups or affinity groups.</li></sl></p><p num="0023">The polymeric backbone of this invention can be either synthetic or naturally-occurring,
and includes a number of macromers previously described as useful for the
preparation of polymeric matrices. Generally, the backbone is one that is soluble, or
nearly soluble, in aqueous solutions such as water, or water with added organic
solvent (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide) or can be rendered soluble using an appropriate
solvent or combination of solvents. Alternatively, the polymeric backbone can be a
material which is a liquid under ambient physiological conditions. Backbones for use
in preparing biodegradable gels are preferably hydrolyzable under <i>in vivo</i> conditions.</p><p num="0024">In general, the polymeric backbones of this invention can be divided into two
categories: biodegradable or bioresorbable, and biostable reagents. These can be
further divided into reagents which form hydrophilic, hydrogel matricies and reagents
which form non-hydrogel matricies.</p><p num="0025">Bioresorbable hydrogel-forming backbones are generally naturally occurring
polymers such as polysaccharides, examples of which include, but are not limited to,
hyaluronic acid (HA), starch, dextran, heparin, and chitosan; and proteins (and other
polyamino acids), examples of which include but are not limited to gelatin, collagen,
fibronectin, laminin, albumin and active peptide domains thereof. Matrices formed
from these materials degrade under physiological conditions, generally via enzyme-mediated
hydrolysis.</p><p num="0026">Bioresorbable matrix-forming backbones are generally synthetic polymers
prepared via condensation polymerization of one or more monomers. Matrix-forming
polymers of this type include polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA),
polycaprolactone (PCL), as well as copolymers of these materials, polyanhydrides,
and polyortho esters. </p><p num="0027">Biostable hydrogel matrix-forming backbones are generally synthetic or
naturally occurring polymers which are soluble in water, matrices of which are
hydrogels or water-containing gels. Examples of this type of backbone include
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyacrylamide (PAA),
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and the like.</p><p num="0028">Biostable matrix-forming backbones are generally synthetic polymers formed
from hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate,
dimethyl siloxanes, and the like. These backbone materials generally do not possess
significant water solubility but can be formulated as neat liquids which form strong
matrices upon activation. It is also possible to synthesize backbone polymers which
contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers.</p><p num="0029">Polymeric backbones of polymerizable macromers can optionally provide a
number of desirable functions or attributes, e.g., as described in the above-captioned
Hubbell patents, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Backbones can be provided with water soluble regions, biodegradable regions,
hydrophobic regions, as well as polymerizable regions.</p><p num="0030">As used herein, the term "polymerizable group" will generally refer to a group
that is polymerizable by initiation by free radical generation, most preferably by
photoinitiators activated by visible or long wavelength ultraviolet radiation. Preferred
polymerizable groups include acrylates, methacrylates, ethacrylates, itaconates,
acrylamides, methacrylamide, and styrene.</p><p num="0031">Typically, polymerizable groups are incorporated into a macromer subsequent
to the initial macromer formation using standard thermochemical reactions. Thus, for
example, polymerizable groups can be added to collagen via reaction of amine
containing lysine residues with acryloyl chloride or glycidyl acrylate. These reactions
result in collagen containing pendent polymerizable moieties. Similarly, when
synthesizing a macromer for use as described in the present invention, monomers
containing reactive groups can be incorporated into the synthetic scheme. For
example, hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) or aminopropylmethacrylamide
(APMA) can be copolymerized with N-vinylpyrrolidone or acrylamide yielding a 
water-soluble polymer with pendent hydroxyl or amine groups. These pendent groups
can subsequently be reacted with acryloyl chloride or glycidyl acrylate to form water-soluble
polymers with pendent polymerizable groups.</p><p num="0032">Initiator groups useful in the system of the present invention include those that
can be used to initiate, by free radical generation, polymerization of the macromers to
a desired extent and within a desired time frame. Crosslinking and polymerization are
generally initiated among macromers by a light-activated free-radical polymerization
initiator. Preferred initiators for long wave UV and visible light initiation include
ethyl eosin, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone, other acetophenone derivatives,
thioxanthone, benzophenone, and camphorquinone.</p><p num="0033">Preferred polymeric initiators are photosensitive molecules which capture light
energy and initiate polymerization of the macromers. Other preferred polymeric
initiators are thermosensitive molecules which capture thermal energy and initiate
polymerization of the macromers.</p><p num="0034">Photoinitiation of the free radical polymerization of macromers of the present
invention will generally occur by one of three mechanisms. The first mechanism
involves a homolytic alpha cleavage reaction between a carbonyl group and an
adjacent carbon atom. This type of reaction is generally referred to as a Norrish type I
reaction. Examples of molecules exhibiting Norrish type I reactivity and useful in a
polymeric initiating system include derivatives of benzoin ether and acetophenone.</p><p num="0035">The second mechanism involves a hydrogen abstraction reaction, either intra-or
intermolecular. This initiation system can be used without additional energy
transfer acceptor molecules and utilizing nonspecific hydrogen abstraction, but is
more commonly used with an energy transfer acceptor, typically a tertiary amine,
which results in the formation of both aminoalkyl radicals and ketyl radicals.
Examples of molecules exhibiting hydrogen abstraction reactivity and useful in a
polymeric initiating system, include analogs of benzophenone, thioxanthone, and
camphorquinone. </p><p num="0036">When using a polymeric initiator of the hydrogen abstraction variety, pendent
tertiary amine groups can be incorporated into the polymeric backbone of the
macromer. This will insure that all free radicals formed are polymer-bound.</p><p num="0037">The third mechanism involves photosensitization reactions utilizing
photoreducible or photo-oxidizable dyes. In most instances, photoreducible dyes are
used in conjunction with a reductant, typically, a tertiary amine. The reductant
intercepts the induced triplet producing the radical anion of the dye and the radical
cation of the reductant. Examples of molecules exhibiting photosensitization
reactivity and useful in a polymeric initiating system include eosin Y, rose bengal, and
erythrosin. Reductants can be incorporated into the polymer backbone, thereby
assuring that all free radicals will be polymer-bound.</p><p num="0038">Thermally reactive polymeric initiators are also useful for the polymerization
of macromers. Examples of thermally reactive initiators usable in a polymeric
initiating system include 4,4' azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid) and analogs of benzoyl
peroxide.</p><p num="0039">A surprisingly beneficial effect of the use of polymeric initiators to polymerize
macromers is the increased efficiency of polymerization exhibited by these polymeric
initiators as compared to their low molecular weight counterparts. This increased
efficiency is seen in all three photoinitiation mechanisms useful for the
polymerization of macromers.</p><p num="0040">Polymeric initiation of monomer solutions has been investigated for its
application in the field of UV-curable coatings for industrial uses, c.f. U.S. Patent No.
4,315,998 (Neckers) and PCT Application, International Publication No. WO
97/24376 (Kuester, <i>et.al</i>.) but there have been no reports of the adaptation of the use
of polymeric initiators for the polymerization of macromers in the presence of
biologic material or for the creation of drug-releasing matrices.</p><p num="0041">High efficiency of initiation is particularly important in systems such as these.
It is generally desirable, when forming polymeric matrices in the presence of biologic
or bioactive materials, to minimize the exposure time of the material to the energy 
source used to initiate polymerization. It is therefore imperative that the initiation
system utilized possess optimum initiation efficiency.</p><p num="0042">When matrix strength or durability are required for a particular application,
high efficiency is again a necessary characteristic of an initiation system. When a
matrix-forming system is initiated, the free radical polymerization of the system is
propagated until gelation and vitrification of the polymerizing system render the
diffusion of the elements of the matrix-forming system too difficult. Therefore, the
higher the efficiency of the initiation system, the more complete the polymerization
resulting in the formation of stronger, more durable matrices. The polymeric
initiation systems described in this invention provide a higher degree of efficiency,
without the use of accelerants, than is attainable using nonpolymer-bound, low
molecular weight initiators.</p><p num="0043">Another beneficial effect is realized when the initiating groups on the
polymeric initiators consist of groups exhibiting hydrogen abstraction reactivity, i.e.,
the ability to abstract hydrogens intermolecularly. The beneficial effect is important
when macromer systems containing these initiators are used as tissue adhesives,
endovascular paving, formation of barriers to prevent post-surgical adhesions, or any
application involving the "adhesion" of the matrix to one or more surfaces. Since
initiators exhibiting this type of reactivity can abstract hydrogens from adjacent
molecules, when a macromer system containing polymeric initiators of this type is
applied to a substrate, photoactivation of the system causes the abstraction of
hydrogens from the substrate by the initiators, thus forming a free radical on the
substrate and a free radical on the initiator. This diradical can subsequently collapse
forming a covalent bond between the macromer system and the substrate.</p><p num="0044">Other initiator groups on the same macromer initiate free radical reactions
with other macromers resulting in the formation of a crosslinked matrix covalently
bound to the surface. Initiator groups exhibiting this type of reactivity include
analogs of benzophenone and thioxanthone. As can be readily understood, only
polymeric initiators are capable of accomplishing this adhesion of the matrix to a 
surface, low molecular weight analogs of these initiators cannot produce this
phenomenon.</p><p num="0045">In another embodiment, the polymeric initiator comprises a polymeric
backbone with pendent initiator groups and pendent reactive or affinity groups. These
reactive or affinity groups enable the polymeric initiator to bind to target groups on
surfaces of interest. This allows the polymeric initiator to bind to the surface of
interest. In this manner, interfacial polymerization of macromers can be
accomplished. A solution of polymeric initiator-containing pendent reactive or
affinity groups is applied to a surface with target sites. The reactive or affinity groups
on the polymeric initiator react with the sites on the surface causing the polymeric
initiator to bind to the surface. Excess polymeric initiator can then be washed away.
A solution of a polymerizable macromer is then applied to the surface. When light
energy in applied to the system, a free radical polymerization reaction is initiated only
at the surface of interest. By varying the concentration of the polymerizable
macromer and the illumination time, the thickness and crosslink density of the
resulting matrix on the surface can be manipulated.</p><p num="0046">Generally, there are two methods by which an initiator group can be
incorporated into a polymeric backbone. The first method involves the formation of a
monomer which includes the initiator. This can be accomplished readily using
standard chemical reactions. For example, the acid chloride analog of an initiator can
be reacted with an amine-containing monomer, to form a monomer which contains the
initiator.</p><p num="0047">The second method of incorporating initiator groups into a polymeric
backbone involves coupling a reactive analog of the initiator with a preformed
polymer. For example, an acid chloride analog of an initiator can be reacted with a
polymer containing pendent amine groups forming a polymer bearing pendent
initiator groups.</p><p num="0048">Polymeric matrices prepared from macromer systems can be used in a variety
of applications, including: </p><heading><u style="single">Cellular Encapsulation.</u></heading><p num="0049">The use of hydrogels to form micro- or
macrocapsules containing cells and other tissue, is well documented in the literature.
Applications include the treatment of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
disease, ALS, chronic pain, and others. Descriptions of cellular encapsulation
methods can be found throughout the patent and scientific literature. The use of the
instant invention provides methods of encapsulating cells in two basic ways.</p><heading>1) Bulk polymerization</heading><p num="0050">In this embodiment, cellular material is mixed in a solution of the macromer
system and energy subsequently added to activate initiation of free radical
polymerization. Prior to initiation, the solution containing the macromer system with
suspended cellular material, can be placed in molds, shaped in particular geometric
shapes, or placed inside a preformed membrane system, such as a hollow fiber. Upon
illumination or other energy addition, the initiation of free radical polymerization
causes the macromer system to gel, forming a cell-containing matrix in the desired
shape. When formed into free-standing geometric shapes, the formulation of the
macromer system can be designed to provide the desired degrees of durability and
permselectivity to the subsequently formed matrix. When formed inside membrane
structures, such as hollow fibers designed to provide the desired permselectivity, the
macromer system can be formulated to provide the desired characteristics of the cell-suspending
matrix, such as biocompatibility, etc.</p><heading>2) Interfacial polymerization</heading><p num="0051">In this embodiment, a membrane is formed directly on the surface of the
cellular material. A solution of polymerizable or non-polymerizable polymeric
initiator-containing pendent affinity groups (e.g., positively charged groups) is mixed
with the cellular material. The affinity groups bind to the sites on the surface of the
cellular material. The excess polymeric initiator is subsequently washed away and the
cellular material suspended in a solution of polymerizable macromer. Since initiator
groups are present only at the surface of the cellular material, when light energy is
applied, polymerization is initiated only at the surface:macromer interface. By
manipulating the duration of illumination and macromer formulation, a polymeric 
matrix exhibiting the desired characteristics of thickness, durability, permselectivity,
etc. is formed directly on the surface of the cellular material.</p><heading><u style="single">Adhesives and sealants.</u></heading><p num="0052">Polymeric matrix systems have also found
extensive use as adhesives for tissue and other surfaces. For this application, a
solution of a macromer system is applied to a surface to which adhesion is desired,
another surface is contacted with this surface, and illumination is applied forming a
surface-to-surface junction. If a temporary adhesive is desired, the macromer system
can be composed of degradable macromers.</p><heading><u style="single">Barriers.</u></heading><p num="0053">Polymeric matrices can be used for the formation of barriers on
surfaces for various applications. One such application is a barrier for the prevention
of tissue adhesions following surgery. For this application, a macromer system in
liquid form is applied to the surface of damaged tissue. The liquid is illuminated to
polymerize the macromers. The polymeric matrix prevents other tissue from adhering
to the damaged tissue. Both degradable and non-degradable macromer systems can be
used for this purpose. As described above, both bulk polymerization and interfacial
polymerization methods can be used to prepare surface coatings of this type.</p><heading><u style="single">Controlled Release Carriers.</u></heading><p num="0054">Polymeric matrices find wide application as
controlled release vehicles. For this application, a solution of a macromer system and
drug, protein, or other active substance is applied to a surface. The solution is
illuminated to polymerize the macromers. The polymeric matrix contains the drug,
when exposed to a physiological or other liquid-containing environment, the drug is
slowly released into the environment. The release profile of the entrained drug can be
manipulated by varying the formulation of the macromer system. Both degradable
and non-degradable macromer systems can be utilized for this purpose. Likewise,
both bulk and interfacial polymerization techniques can be used to prepare controlled
drug-releasing surfaces. In an alternative embodiment, a drug or other active
substance can be imbibed by a preformed matrix on a surface. The absorption and
release characteristics of the matrix can be manipulated by varying the crosslink
density, the hydrophobicity of the matrix, and the solvent used for imbibition. </p><p num="0055">Alternatively, drug-containing polymeric microspheres can be prepared using
standard techniques. A wide range of drugs and bioactive materials can be delivered
using the invention which include but are not limited to, antithrombogenic, antiinflammatory,
antimicrobial, antiproliferative, and anticancer agents, as well as
growth factors, morphogenic proteins, and the like.</p><heading><u style="single">Tissue Replacement/Scaffolding.</u></heading><p num="0056">Polymeric matrices have found utility as
three-dimensional scaffolding for hybrid tissues and organs. For this application, a
macromer system in liquid form is applied to a tissue defect and subsequently
illuminated to polymerize the macromers forming a matrix upon which ingrowing
cells can migrate and organize into a functional tissue. In one embodiment, the
macromer system additionally includes a growth factor which is slowly released and
stimulates the ingrowth of desired cell types. In another embodiment, the macromers
include pendent extracellular matrix peptides which can stimulate the ingrowth of
desired cell types. A third embodiment would include both of the above features. An
alternative embodiment includes cells included in the matrix with or without
additional growth factor. The scaffolding can be generated <i>in vitro</i> by placing the
liquid macromer system in a mold or cavities in a device, or can be generated <i>in vivo</i>
by applying the liquid macromer system to a tissue defect. Both degradable and non-degradable
macromer systems could be used for this application, but degradable
matrices are preferred.</p><heading><u style="single">Wound Dressing.</u></heading><p num="0057">Polymeric matrices have been used extensively as
superior wound dressing preparations. Currently, hydrogel and hydrocolloid wound
dressing materials are being increasingly used due to their superior wound healing
properties. For this application, a macromer system in liquid form is applied to the
wound site and subsequently formed into a flexible polymeric matrix upon exposure
to light. When applied as a liquid, the macromer preparation conforms to the irregular
surface of the wound. Upon illumination, a flexible matrix is formed which is
completely conformal to the surface of the wound; no fluid-filled pockets which can
act as sites of bacterial infiltration can exist. In one embodiment, the macromer
system additionally includes one or more therapeutic agents, such as growth factors or 
antimicrobial agents which are slowly released into the wound. Both degradable and
non-degradable macromer systems can be used for this application.</p><heading><u style="single"><i>In Situ</i> Device Formation.</u></heading><p num="0058">Polymeric materials can be implanted into the
body to replace or support the function of diseased or damaged tissues. One example
of this is the use of hollow cylindrical polymeric devices to support the structure of a
coronary artery following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
Currently, pre-formed cylindrical devices are implanted via catheter insertion
followed by balloon expansion to secure the device. The expanded device supports
the structure of the artery and prevents the reversion of the artery to the closed
position (restenosis).</p><p num="0059">For this application, a liquid macromer preparation could be applied to an
injured artery via a multi-lumen catheter containing an illumination element. After
application of the liquid macromer system to the injured tissue, a semi-rigid polymeric
matrix can be formed by a brief illumination. Upon removal of the catheter, a hollow,
cylindrical, conformal polymeric device remains to support the artery and prevent
restenosis. In one embodiment, the macromer system additionally includes a
releasable therapeutic agent or agents, such as antiproliferative and/or antithrombotic
drugs. These agents are slowly released from the formed matrix, to provide additional
therapeutic benefit to the injured tissues. Both degradable and non-degradable
macromer systems can be used for this application.</p><p num="0060">The invention will be further described with reference to the following nonlimiting
