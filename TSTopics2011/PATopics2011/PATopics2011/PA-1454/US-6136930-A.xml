This invention particularly relates to metallocene catalysts and systems useful for the polymerization and copolymerization of alpha-olefins and to high melt strength polymers and products and applications therefrom.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Commercial polyethylenes generally fall into one of two general categories based on their processability and their product properties.</p><p>Processability is the ability to predict and economically process and shape a polymer uniformly. Processability involves such elements as thermal stability, how easily the polymer flows, melt strength, and whether or not the extrudate is distortion free. Linear polyethylene (LPE) is more difficult to process than low density polyethylenes (LDPE) because LPE's are not as thermally stable, LPE's require more motor power and produce higher extruder pressures to match the extrusion rate of LDPE's. LPE's also have lower melt strength which, for example, adversely affects bubble stability during blown film extrusion, and they are prone to melt fracture at commercial shear rates. On the other hand, however, LPE's exhibit superior physical properties as compared to LDPE's.</p><p>In order to take advantage of the superior physical and mechanical properties of LPE's, expensive antioxidants and processing aids must be added to the polymer, and extrusion equipment must be modified to achieve commercial extrusion rates.</p><p>It is common practice in the industry to add low levels of an LDPE to an LPE to increase melt strength, to increase shear sensitivity, i.e., to increase flow at a given horse power; and to reduce the tendency to melt fracture. However, these blends generally have poor mechanical properties as compared with neat LPE.</p><p>A second technique to improve the processability of LPE's is to broaden the products' molecular weight distribution (MWD) by blending two or more LPE's with significantly different molecular weights, or by changing to a polymerization catalyst which produces broad MWD. The physical and mechanical properties and the processability of these broader MWD products are generally intermediate between those of narrower LPE components and LDPE/LPE blends with equivalent Mw.</p><p>Therefore, a need exists for catalyst which offers the processability of blends but the properties of the linear blend components.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>This invention is directed toward the polymerization of olefins, optionally with a comonomer in the presence of metallocene catalyst to produce a polymer product having a controlled molecular weight distribution, ranging from narrow to broad, a high molecular weight and a narrow composition distribution.</p><p>The catalyst of the invention provides for linear polyethylenes and ethylene-α-olefin copolymers with substantially higher melt strength than linear polyethylenes produced with a conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst or a typical metallocene catalyst. These polyethylenes and copolymers flow in an extruder more easily than their analogs and have superior mechanical properties to polymers produced with post-reactor blending.</p><p>In one embodiment the invention provides a catalyst for polymerizing olefins comprising a first component comprising at least one transition metal of Group IV, V or VI and bonded to at least two cyclopentadienyl containing rings, said rings each having at least two substituents bonded to each of said rings in the same position; a second component comprising said transition metal and said cyclopentadienyl containing rings, said rings each having at least two substituents bonded to each of said rings in the same or different position than said substituents of said first component; said substituents of the said first and second components can be the same or different, with the provision that when the substituents of said first and second components are the same, said substituents of said components are bonded to said rings in different positions; and a third component comprising said transition metal bonded to said cyclopentadienyl containing rings where one of said rings is substituted identically as said first component and another of said rings is substituted identically as said second component. In one embodiment the substituents are hydrocarbyl substituents.</p><p>The invention further provides for catalyst systems comprising the catalyst component above in combination with a cocatalyst and/or activator for the catalyst. The cocatalyst or activator can be either alumoxane or an ionic activator.</p><p>In yet another embodiment the catalyst is supported.</p><p>In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a process for producing polyolefins by contacting olefin monomer, optionally with comonomer in the presence of the catalyst system above</p><p>The invention also provides for the production of polymers with high melt strengths that are easily processable through a die when making film. The polymers of the invention are more readily extrudable through a die than their conventional Ziegler-Natta analogs. Further, the invention provides for a film, particularly a blown film, that has a unique combination of physical properties.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Introduction</p><p>This invention is generally directed toward a catalyst useful for polymerizing and copolymerizing olefins. The polymers produced have unique properties making them easily processable without the need for blending to increase processability.</p><p>The catalyst of the invention is classified generally in the field of transition metal catalysis. Over the past few years a new catalyst technology has developed, which provides for the modification and/or control over the properties and characteristics of a polymer. This technology generally involves the use of single-site catalysts to produce a broad range of polymers generally having a narrow molecular weight distribution (NMWD) and a narrow composition distribution (NCD). The art has focused on many types of catalysts and catalyst systems. A catalyst that produces a polymer having both a broad molecular weight distribution (BMWD), a high molecular weight (HMW) and a NCD has gone unknown until now.</p><p>Traditionally in the art metallocene catalyst are utilized in their pure form requiring many purification steps. In some instances these pure catalysts are combined together to produce a polymer having a bimodal MWD.

For the preferred alpha-olefin monomer ethylene (C.sub.2), depending on the catalyst, the C.sub.x /C.sub.2 ratios is preferably less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.1, and as low as about 0.02 to provide a polymer having a density in the range of from about 0.86 g/cm.sup.3 to about 0.97 g/cm.sup.3, preferably about 0.88 g/cm.sup.3 to about 0.94 g/cm.sup.3, more preferably between about 0.90 g/cm.sup.3 to about 0.935 g/cm.sup.3 and most preferably between about 0.91 g/cm.sup.3 to about 0.93 g/cm.sup.3.</p><p>MWD, or polydispersity, is a well known characteristic of polymers. MWD is generally described as the ratio of the weight average molecular weight (Mw) to the number average molecular weight (Mn). The ratio Mw/Mn can be measured directly by gel permeation chromatography techniques, or indirectly, by measuring the ratio of I.sub.21 to I.sub.2 as described in ASTM D-1238-F and ASTM D-1238-E respectively. I.sub.2 is well known in the art as equivalent to Melt Index (MI). I.sub.21 is also known as high load melt index (HLMI). MI is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the polymer (Mw). The MI of the polymers of the invention are generally in the range of about 0.1 dg/min to about 1000 dg/min, preferably about 0.2 dg/min to about 300 dg/min, more preferably about 0.3 to about 200 dg/min and most preferably about 0.5 dg/min to about 100 dg/min.</p><p>The ratio of I.sub.21 /I.sub.2 is known as the melt index ratio (MIR) and for the purposes of this patent specification the ratio is also defined to be melt flow ratio (MFR). MIR is generally proportional to the MWD.</p><p>The MIR of the polymers of this invention are generally in the range of greater than 14 to about 200, preferably about 18 to about 60 and most preferably about 22 to about 45.</p><p>Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are several methods for determining MWD of a polymer sample. For the purposes of this patent specification the molecular weight distribution of a polymer can be determined with a Waters Gel Permeation Chromatograph equipped with Ultrastyrogel columns and a refractive index detector. In this development, the operating temperature of the instrument was set at 145 calibration standards included sixteen polystyrenes of precisely known molecular weight, ranging from a molecular weight of 500 to a molecular weight of 5.2 million, and a polyethylene standard, NBS 1475.</p><p>The polymers of the invention as compared to traditional single metallocene polymers have a broad molecular weight distribution. The MWD of the polymers of the invention are in the range of greater than about 2.5 to about greater than 30, preferably in the range of greater than about 3.0 to about 20 and most preferably in the range of about 4 to about 10. In another embodiment the MWD is greater than about 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.</p><p>Another important characteristic of the polymer of the invention is its composition distribution (CD). As is well known to those skilled in the art, the composition distribution of a copolymer relates to the uniformity of distribution of comonomer among the molecules of the copolymer. Metallocene catalysts are known to incorporate comonomer very evenly among the polymer molecules they produce. Thus, copolymers produced from a catalyst system having a single metallocene have a very narrow composition distribution--most of the polymer molecules will have roughly the same comonomer content, and within each molecule the comonomer will be randomly distributed. Conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts, on the other hand generally yield copolymers having a considerably broader composition distribution. Comonomer inclusion will vary widely among the polymer molecules.</p><p>A measure of composition distribution is the "Composition Distribution Breadth Index" ("CDBI"). CDBI is defined as the weight percent of the copolymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50% (that is, 25% on each side) of the median total molar comonomer content. The CDBI of a copolymer is readily determined utilizing well known techniques for isolating individual fractions of a sample of the copolymer. One such technique is Temperature Rising Elution Fraction (TREF), as described in Wild, et al., J. Poly. Sci., Poly. Phys. Ed., vol. 20, p. 441 (1982) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,204, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>To determine CDBI, a solubility distribution curve is first generated for the copolymer. This may be accomplished using data acquired from the TREF technique described above. This solubility distribution curve is a plot of the weight fraction of the copolymer that is solubilized as a function of temperature. This is converted to a weight fraction versus composition distribution curve. For the purpose of simplifying the correlation of composition with elution temperature all fractions are assumed to have a Mn greater than or equal to 15,000 g/mole, where Mn is the number average molecular weight fraction. Low weight fractions generally represent a trivial portion of the resin of the present invention. The remainder of this description and the appended claims maintain this convention of the number average molecular weight of the fraction.</p><p>From the weight fraction versus composition distribution curve the CDBI is determined by establishing what weight percent of the sample has a comonomer content within 25% each side of the median comonomer content. Further details of determining the CDBI of a copolymer are known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, PCT Patent Application WO 93/03093, published Feb. 18, 1993.</p><p>Long chain branching can be determined in the ethylene-butene examples of the invention with C13-NMR. Samples are dissolved in deuterated tetrachloroethane at a concentration of 10-15 wt %. C13-NMR spectra are acquired on a Varian 400 NMR spectrometer at 100 MHz. Acquisition conditions were: 90 second acquisition time; 8800 Hz sweep width; 125 temperature; nominally 5000 FIDs; and continuous Quantification was based on the resonance of the two αδ+ carbons and the one nBn methylene carbon, i.e., the three equivalent α-methylene carbons of a long chain branch at 34.69 ppm. The nearest neighboring signal, the αγ resonance of a BEB sequence at 34.71, is sufficiently small and well resolved from the LCB α-methylene signal with these materials that it does not interfere. ##STR1##</p><p>The assignment at 34.69 was confirmed by adding known amounts of Dowlex 2045 between 0.1 and 1.0 wt % to a number of the butene examples of the invention. Dowlex 2045 is an ethylene-octene copolymer which contains no long-chain branching, but does contain hexyl branches, the α-methylenes of which are indistinguishable from the α-methylenes of a long-chain branch. In each experiment, the magnitude of the signal at 34.69 corresponded to the amount of Dowlex added.</p><p>The polymers of the present invention have CDBI's generally in the range of greater than 50% to 99%, preferably in the range of 55% to 85%, and more preferably 60% to 80%, even more preferably greater than 60%, still even more preferably greater than 65%. Obviously, higher or lower CDBI's may be obtained using other catalyst systems with changes in the operating conditions of the process employed.</p><p>This polymers of this invention are distinguishable over LDPE, in that, for the purposes of this patent specification the polymers of the invention are substantially linear and not formed by a free radical polymerization process. The polymers of the invention are also distinguishable from known LLDPE polymers on the basis of their molecular weight distribution (MWD). The MWD of the present polymers is materially broader than that of LLDPE's produced using the same metallocene in an unsupported form in a solution or slurry polymerization process. The polydispersity index (M.sub.w /M.sub.n) of our polymers is typically in the range of 2.6-10, compared to a range of 2-3.5, typical for known metallocene LLDPE polymers. In this regard the present polymers are similar to many commercially available LLDPE polymers produced using conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts. However, the tails of the molecular weight distribution curve for the present polymer are considerably smaller than those of known conventional Ziegler-Natta LLDPE's. This distinction is readily apparent by comparing the ratio of M.sub.z /M.sub.w (the ratio of the third moment to the second moment) and M.sub.z+1 /M.sub.w (ratio of the fourth moment to the second moment). Utilizing the present invention, LLDPE polymers can be produced with an M.sub.z /M.sub.w less than 3.0, usually less than 2.5 and most typically in the range of 2-2.5. In contrast, the ratio of M.sub.z /M.sub.w for conventional Ziegler-Natta polymers is typically above 2.5. Table 4 provides further data regarding M.sub.z and M.sub.w for our polymers.</p><p>The polymers of this invention unexpectedly exhibit surprising melt strength properties, see Table 4. The melt strength of a polymer at a particular temperature, e.g., 190 Gottfert Rheotens Melt Strength Apparatus. The measurement is done by grasping the extrudate from a capillary rheometer, or from an extruder equipped with a capillary die, using variable speed gears and increasing the gear speed at a constant acceleration until the molten polymer strand breaks. The force in the strand is measured with a balance beam in conjunction with a linear variable displacement transducer. The force required to extend and then break the extrudate is defined as the melt strength.</p><p>The force is measured in centinewtons (cN). A typical plot of force vs. wheel velocity. Linear polymers frequently resonate immediately before the strand breaks. In such cases, the plateau force is approximated by the midline between the oscillations.</p><p>Typically the polymers of the invention have a melt strength in the range of about 3.0 centi-newton (cN) to about 20 cN, preferably greater than about 3.5 cN and most preferably greater than about 5.0 cN, even more preferably greater than 6 cN and still more preferably greater than 7 cN. The melt strength of the polymers of the invention are more than twice that of typical metallocene or conventional Ziegler-Natta made polymers. Typically the polymers of the present invention have melt strengths in the range of 2 conventional Ziegler-Natta produced polymers, the polymers of the invention are preferably greater than 2 than 2.5.times..</p><p>Film Properties</p><p>One of the processing disadvantages of LDPE's is their inability to be drawn down into thin gauges, e.g., less than 25.4.mu.(1 mil). Copolymers produced with metallocenes A and E, on the other hand, have substantially greater draw-down, as do typical linear polyethylenes. Gauges less than 12.7.mu.(0.5 mil) are easily achievable.</p><p>The films of this invention can be formed from the polymer of the invention by methods well known in the art. For example, forming operations include, film, sheet, and other fiber extrusion and co-extrusion as well as blow molding, injection molding and roto molding. Films include blown or cast films in monolayer or multilayer constructions formed by coextrusion or by lamination. The preferred forming operation for the film of the invention is a blown film operation.</p><p>For example, the polymers of the invention may be extruded in a molten state through a flat die and then cooled to form sheets or cast films. Alternatively, the polymers may be extruded in a molten state through an annular die and then blown and cooled to form a tubular film. The tubular film may be axially slit and unfolded to form a flat film. The films of the invention may be unoriented, uniaxially oriented or biaxially oriented.</p><p>The films of the invention may be single layer or multi-layer films. The multiple-layer films may consist of one or more layers formed from polymers of the invention. The films may also have one or more additional layers formed from other materials such as other polymers, LLDPE, LDPE, HDPE, PP, PB, EVA, polyester, EVOH and, for instance, metal foils, paper and the like.</p><p>Multiple-layer films may be formed by methods well known in the art. If all layers are polymers, the polymers may be coextruded through a coextrusion feedblock and die assembly to yield a film with two or more layers adhered together but differing in composition. Multiple-layer films may also be formed by extrusion coating whereby a substrate material is contacted with the hot molten polymer as the polymer exits the die. Extrusion coating is useful with substrates that are woven or knitted from natural or synthetic fibers or yarns, e.g., textiles, or substrates made from non-polymer materials such as glass, ceramic, paper or metal.</p><p>Multiple-layer films may also be formed by combining two or more single layer films prepared as described above. The two layers of a film so formed may be adhered together with an adhesive or by the application of heat and pressure.</p><p>The films of the invention are useful as shrink films, cling film, stretch film, sealing films, oriented films, snack packaging, heavy duty bags, grocery sacks, baked and frozen food packaging, medical packaging, industrial liners, membranes, etc. in food-contact and non-food contact application. Fiber forming operations include melt spinning, solution spinning and melt blown fiber operations. Such fibers may be used in woven or non-woven form to make filters, diaper fabrics, medical garments, geotextiles, etc. General extruded articles include medical tubing, wire and cable coatings, geomembranes, and pond liners. Molded articles include single and multi-layered constructions in the form of bottles, tanks, large hollow articles, rigid food containers, toys and the like.</p><p>The films of the invention can contain anti-oxidants, slip, anti-block, processing aids, pigments, UV inhibitors, anti-static agents, or other additives as required for the application with out substantially departing from the scope of our invention.</p><p>The polymers of the invention can also be employed in multi-layer films. In some applications they will be desirable as the skin layer in coextruded films to impart enhanced clarity, blocking resistance and cling performance to the final film. In other applications they will be used as the core layer, taking advantage of their toughness and puncture resistance.</p><p>While film is likely the single most important application for polymers of the invention, they have other uses. The polymers of the invention are useful in producing plastic sheeting, injection molding, rotomolding and other processes.</p><p>The polymer of the invention can be blended with additives and other ingredients known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as fillers, antioxidants, tackifiers, UV stabilizers, heat stabilizers, pigments, dyes, waxes, silica, talc and the like. It is also possible to add peroxides and other free radical generators to the inventive polymers in order to modify their Theological properties.</p><p>In addition, the polymers of the present invention can be modified by blending with other polymers. It is well known in the prior art to add various other polymers to LLDPE in order to obtain improved performance. For example, polymers can be added to improve the processing characteristics of the LLDPE and/or the properties of films made from the polymers. Such film properties may include stiffness, cling, clarity, gloss, adhesion to substrates, cutting characteristics, sealing characteristics, coefficient of friction, tensile strength, MD and TD tear strength, impact strength, puncture resistance, blocking tendency, surface characteristics, shrinkage characteristics, low temperature flexibility, gas and moisture permeability, other properties. Generally the property improvements represent increases in the level of the particular film property, but sometimes blending is done to achieve lower property levels, such as, for example, lower tear resistance in order to impart good openability to packages made from the films.</p><p>Polymers suitable for blending with the inventive polymers of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyolefins such as polypropylene and ethylene propylene copolymers, VLDPE, plastomers, LDPE, EVA, EMA, copolymers of acrylic acid, polymethylmethacrylate or any other polymers polymerizable by a high-pressure free radical process, PVC, polybutene-1, isotactic polybutene, ABS resins, elastomers such as ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), vulcanized EPR, EPDM, block copolymer elastomers such as SBS and the like, nylons, polycarbonates, PET resins, crosslinked polyethylene, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polymers of aromatic monomers such as polystyrene, poly-1 esters, high molecular weight HDPE, low molecular weight HDPE, graft copolymers generally, polyacrylonitrile homopolymer or copolymers, thermoplastic polyamides, polyacetal, polyvinylidine fluoride and other fluorinated elastomers, polyethylene glycols, polyisobutylene (PIB), hydrocarbon resins, terpene resins, and other tackifying polymers, and numerous others and combinations thereof.</p><p>Three distinctive features of films made with the subject copolymers relative to conventional Ziegler-Natta copolymers are their low extractables (and associated low reblock), their good clarity, and their unusual tensile properties at low elongation.</p><p>The low extractables from films made with these products is especially dramatic when compared to the extractables from hexene copolymer films made with conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts at higher MI's (e.g., control #2). The broader MWD polymers of the invention made with metallocene A have a substantially lower extractable level than the conventional Ziegler-Natta made products. The preferred range of extractables for the film of the invention are in the range of 0.5% to 2.0%, preferably 0.5 to 1.6% and most preferably 0.5 to 1.4%.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>In order to provide a better understanding of the invention including representative advantages thereof, the following examples are offered.</p><p>Examples 1-9 and 15-26 illustrate embodiments of this invention.

A nitrogen filled 2 liter stirred autoclave was first treated with 0.15 ml of a triethyl aluminum in heptane containing 0.03 mmoles of aluminum to remove potential catalyst poisons. 800 ml of isobutane was charged to the autoclave. The temperature of the autoclave was raised to 185 215 psig. Ethylene was then injected to raise the pressure to 335 psig. At this point, 100 mg of the supported catalyst slurried in a small amount of hexane was injected in one shot by an overpressure of ethylene. The ethylene supply valve remained open to maintain a constant 335 psig reactor pressure while monitoring the progress of the reaction from the ethylene flow rate over a period of about 40 minutes. The specific reactor conditions of each example are outlined below in table 5.</p><heading>Polymerization Examples 104-106</heading><p>Examples 104-106 were conducted with the following general polymerization procedure.
