No. 09/709,477, filed Nov. 13, 2000 (pending), which is a continuation of PCT/FR99/01452, filed Jun. 17, 1999, which claims benefit of FR 98/07802, filed Jun. 19, 1998, the entire contents of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in this application.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p num="p-0003"> The present invention relates to novel foaming compositions for washing and treating the hair and/or scalp, comprising at least one active principle chosen from corticosteroids and retinoids, one anionic surfactant, one amphoteric surfactant and one propenetrating agent, and to the treatment process employing such compositions. </p><p num="p-0004"> Psoriasis is one of the commonest skin ailments among all chronic skin diseases. This disease is found in 1.4 to 2.9% of the population. The scalp is one of the favored sites for psoriasis; the latter causes essentially erythemas, desquamations, hyperkeratoses or pruritides and can also be responsible for a reduction in hair density. The treatments used to date involve salicylic acid, local steroids, anthralin, or coal or wood tar. These treatments are unpleasant, in particular when tar is applied, and require lengthy applications, in particular when hair ointments are used. </p><p num="p-0005"> For the purpose of improving the quality of life for the patient, without however decreasing the therapeutic effect of the treatment, foaming compositions comprising corticosteroids have been developed. More particularly, the application time of these foaming compositions is reduced with respect to the conventional treatment. </p><p num="p-0006"> Patent BE 84515 discloses a composition comprising hydrocortisone in a solvent mixture composed of 15 to 60% of aliphatic alcohol, 15 to 60% of propylene glycol and of 5 to 60% of a third solubilizing agent taken from the group consisting of 2-hydroxyethyl salicylate, dipropyl ketone and dimethylcocobenzylammonium chloride. </p><p num="p-0007"> Patent EP 0 325 949 discloses a solution comprising at least 2.5% of corticosteroids, from 25 to 80% of a nonionic surfactant, from 0 to 70% of ethanol, from 0 to 70% of propylene glycol and an antimicrobial agent. </p><p num="p-0008"> Nevertheless, the solvents present in these compositions have a tendency to evaporate very rapidly. Furthermore, the fluidity of these compositions renders the application difficult and it is often necessary to apply these compositions by rubbing in order to allow effective penetration of the active principles, the consequence of which is to irritate the epidermis even more, or to apply these compositions and to allow them to act for several hours, which is annoying to the patient. </p><p num="p-0009"> To avoid evaporation of the solvent, provision has been made, in Patent WO 9627376, for a foam comprising a corticosteroid, a foam-breaking agent, a propellant and buffer. The foam-breaking agent is composed of an aliphatic alcohol, of water, of a fatty alcohol and of a nonionic surfactant. Nevertheless, when these foams are applied to keratinous fibers, their resulting esthetic appearance is not satisfactory and the scalp lying under the keratinous fibers may be insufficiently treated. </p><p num="p-0010"> The Applicant Company has looked for compositions which do not exhibit the abovementioned disadvantages, that is to say a composition which makes it possible to improve the penetration of the active principle while being particularly easy to use and exhibiting good cosmetic properties. </p><p num="p-0011"> The Applicant Company has now developed a foaming composition which exhibits the properties mentioned above. </p><p num="p-0012"> The compositions of the present invention, while making possible good penetration of the active principles, also exhibit an improvement in the cosmetic performances of the compositions for the treatment of skin ailments or of the hair, the compositions of the invention leaving the hair soft and manageable and not rendering it greasy. Furthermore, these compositions are easy to rinse out. </p><p num="p-0013"> The Applicant Company has also found that the foaming compositions of the present invention surprisingly make it possible to obtain a foam which exhibits improved characteristics of volume and of compactness with respect to the foaming compositions for the treatment of skin ailments or of the scalp of the prior art. </p><p num="p-0014"> It has also been found that, surprisingly, the compositions which are subject matters of the present invention are stable over time, making it possible to prevent the precipitation of the active principles, and thus remain clear. </p><p num="p-0015"> One of the subject matters of the invention is thus composed of a foaming composition for washing and treating the hair and/or the scalp. </p><p num="p-0016"> Another subject matter of the invention is a process for washing and treating the hair and/or the scalp employing such a composition. </p><p num="p-0017"> A subject matter of the invention is also a composition according to the invention for its application as medicament. </p><p num="p-0018"> A subject matter of the invention is also the use of the compositions of the invention as medicament and for the manufacture of a medicament intended to treat skin ailments or hair. </p><p num="p-0019"> Other subject matters of the invention will become apparent on reading the description and the examples which follow. </p><p num="p-0020"> The foaming composition for washing and treating the hair and/or the scalp is essentially characterized in that it comprises, in an aqueous medium:
