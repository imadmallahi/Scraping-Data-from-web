Specifically, the present invention relates to cleaning compositions containing high levels of surfactant and containers therefor. The present invention also generally relates to foam-generating dispensers.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="p0002">Compositions containing high levels of surfactant (high surfactant compositions), such as concentrated dish washing compositions, hand soap compositions, shampoo compositions, laundry compositions, scrubbing compositions, etc. are well known and have typically provided in a liquid, a gel or a paste. While liquids and pastes may be useful in a variety of situations, such physical forms are no longer considered new and exciting. Also, while it is desirable to provide new and interesting physical forms, the use of the above compositions has typically been limited to application or pre-application of such liquids, gels and pastes into a substrate, and then the additional step of direct application to the desired surface.</p><p num="p0003">While it is known to employ a foam-generating dispenser to make low-surfactant level compositions foam (i.e., body washes containing &gt; 12% surfactant), this approach has not to date succeeded for high surfactant compositions, as there is typically a direct correlation between increased surfactant levels and increased viscosity. Specifically, the rheology of high surfactant compositions makes it difficult to achieve an acceptable foam without extremely turbulent and violent flow characteristics. As such turbulent flow characteristics often require excessive physical exertion or a highly-pressurized container, the practical result is that formulators are often required to lower the viscosity of their products so as to match the limitations of the foam-generating dispensers currently on the market. Therefore, this approach imparts an artificial, physical constraint upon<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> formulators' freedom to achieve the best performing and/or lowest cost composition if foam-generation is desired.</p><p num="p0004">Accordingly, the need exists for a foam-generating dispenser which is able to produce foam from a high surfactant composition. The need further exists for a foam-generating dispenser which may produce such a foam, without the need for excessive physical exertion, and/or the need to use an aerosol propellant.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="p0005">The present invention relates to foam-generating kit containing a non-aerosol container with a foam-generating dispenser and a high surfactant cleaning composition, preferably within the container. The high surfactant composition contains, by weight of the high surfactant composition, at least about 20% of a surfactant system and comprises an anionic surfactant with an average percentage alkyl branching greater than 30% by weight of the anionic surfactant. When the foam-generating dispenser is employed with the high surfactant composition, the foam-generating dispenser generates a foam having a foam (i.e., volume) to weight ratio of greater than about 2 mL/g.</p><p num="p0006">It has now been found that the combination of a foam-generating dispenser and such high surfactant composition can simultaneously provide acceptable foaming without excessive physical exertion and without employing an aerosol propellant. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that when an increasingly turbulent flow path is produced, even a high surfactant composition can be made to produce an acceptable foam.</p><p num="p0007">Furthermore, it is believed that a cleaning composition dispensed from a foam-generating dispenser according to the present invention may provide better and/or faster cleaning than the same composition dispensed in another manner. Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that the physical foam generation forces the high surfactant composition to a state where it possesses an increased overall surface area. As most cleaning interactions such as speed and completeness of oil emulsification are directly related to the surface area covered, we believe that the form of the present invention can significantly improve overall cleaning. In addition, in the case of a microemulsion and/or a protomicroemulsion, it has surprisingly been found that by forcing the physical<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> generation of foam, the present invention achieves the aesthetic benefit of physical foam, without chemically tying up the surfactant at the air-water interface. Instead, even though there is foam, a greater percentage of the surfactant is chemically available to bind to dirt, oils, etc., than if the foam was created by normal methods such as intermixing surfactant and water.</p><p num="p0008">These and other features, aspects, advantages, and variations of the present invention, and the embodiments described herein, will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure with the appended claims, and are covered within the scope of these claims.</p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p num="p0009">While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the invention, it is believed that the invention will be better understood from the following description of the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals identify like elements, and wherein:

All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (Â°C) unless otherwise specified.</p><p num="p0012">As used herein, the term "comprising" means that other steps, ingredients, elements, etc. which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms "consisting of" and "consisting essentially of".<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p num="p0013">As used herein, the term "dish" means any dishware, tableware, cookware, glassware, cutlery, cutting board, food preparation equipment, etc. which is washed prior to or after contacting food, being used in a food preparation process and/or in the serving of food.</p><p num="p0014">As used herein, the terms "foam" and "suds" are used interchangeably and indicate discrete bubbles of gas bounded by and suspended in a liquid phase.</p><p num="p0015">As used herein, the term "microemulsion" means a oil-in-water emulsion which has the ability to emulsify oil into non-visible droplets. Such non-visible droplets typically have maximum diameter of less than about 100 angstroms (A), preferably less than 50 A as measured by methods known in the art, such as ISO 7027 which measures turbidity at a wavelength of 880 nm. Turbidity measuring equipment is easily available from, for example, Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.A.</p><p num="p0016">As used herein, the term "protomicroemulsion" means a composition which may be diluted with water to form a microemulsion.</p><heading><u style="single">CONTAINER</u></heading><p num="p0017">The container useful herein is a non-aerosol container and typically has a hollow body for holding a high surfactant composition, preferably a dishwashing composition, and is most often a bottle or canister formed of plastic, glass, and/or metal, preferably a polymer or resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polystyrene, ethyl vinyl alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol, thermoplastic elastomer, and combinations thereof, although other materials known in the art may also be used. Such containers will typically hold from about 100 mL to about 2 L of liquid, preferably from about 150 mL to about 1.2 L of liquid, and more preferably from about 200 mL to about 1 L of liquid, and are well known for holding liquid consumer products. Such containers are widely available from many packaging suppliers.</p><p num="p0018">Operatively attached to the container either directly or indirectly is a foam-generating dispenser for generating a foam. When activated, the foam-generating dispenser generates foam and concurrently dispenses the foamed composition from the container. The foam-generating dispenser may be formed as either integral with, or separate from the container. If formed separately, the foam-generating dispenser may attach to the container via methods known in the art such as by employing a transition<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> piece, corresponding threaded male and female members, pressurized and non-pressurized seals, locking and snap-on parts, and/or other methods known in the art. Preferably, the foam-generating dispenser is attached to the container via a transition piece and/or with corresponding threaded male and female members which allow easy refilling.</p><p num="p0019">The foam-generating dispenser may interact with the high surfactant composition via any method so as to generate a foam, such as a chemical reaction, an enzymatic reaction, and/or a mechanical action. However, a mechanical action is preferred herein, and typically involves a mechanism which imparts or mixes a gas, such as air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc., directly into the dishwashing composition in a turbulent manner as it dispenses, so as to physically form the foam. Preferably, the foam-generating dispenser includes a gas imparting mechanism to form the foam from air via an air injection piston, foam-generating aperture, an impinging surface, a mesh or net, a pump, and/or a sprayer, more preferably, an air injection piston, a pump, an impinging surface, a plurality of meshes or nets, and/or a sprayer which injects or imparts air from the atmosphere into the dishwashing composition. In a highly preferred embodiment, the foam-generating dispenser employs at least three, preferably from three to five, meshes wherein the high surfactant composition flows through these meshes in series so as to generate the foam. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that by flowing through the above meshes in series, the high surfactant composition is repeatedly turbulently mixed with air, thereby multiplying the foam-generating effect beyond that of any single mesh. As the percentage of surfactant system of the high surfactant composition increases, additional meshes may be added to provide the desired level of foaming and/or quality of foam.</p><p num="p0020">The foam-generating dispenser also typically includes an activator, preferably a manual activator such as, for example, a trigger, a pressure-activated pumping mechanism, a button, and/or a slider, more preferably a button and/or a pressure-activated pumping mechanism which can be activated with a single finger. It is highly preferred that the activator be designed such that a consumer may easily activate it when their hands are wet and/or slippery, such as when in the middle of a manual dishwashing process. Such an activator should allow the user to easily and conveniently control both the speed of dispensing and the volume dispensed. For certain applications, such as in industry or in public facilities, other activators may be useful, such as an electronic activator, a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> computer-controlled activator, an electric eye or an infrared detection activator, a manual lever-assist activator, etc. The foam-generating dispenser useful herein generates a foam having a foam to weight ratio of greater than about 2 mL/g, more preferably from about 3 mL/g to about 10 mL/g, and even more preferably from about 4 mL/g to about 8 mL/g. Furthermore, the foam-generating dispenser useful herein generates at least about 2 mL foam, preferably from about 3 mL to about 10 mL, and more preferably from about 4 mL to about 8 mL, per mL of dishwashing composition. "Creamy" and "smooth" foams having fine bubbles dispersed relatively evenly throughout may be especially preferred for their aesthetic and/or performance characteristics. In certain cases, preferred foams are those which do not significantly degrade into liquid over a period of 3 minutes are especially preferred. Specifically, when the foam is dispensed onto a clean glass surface (e.g., a PYREXâ¢ plate) and let sit for 3 minutes at 25Â°C, less than 1 mm of liquid should be apparent. Preferably, no liquid is visible at the edge of the foam after 3 minutes. However, in other cases, it has also been found that a certain amount of liquid (i.e., non-foam) is also preferable, as this liquid then permeates into the applicator (e.g., a sponge), and further extends the mileage of the high surfactant composition when it is used for, example, cleaning dishes.</p><p num="p0021">Fig. 1 is a cut-away view of a preferred embodiment of the foam-generating dispenser, 10, with a nozzle, 12, from which the foamed dishwashing composition is dispensed. The dishwashing composition enters the foam-generating dispenser via a dip tube, 14, and flows past a ball, 16, and into a cylinder, 18. A plug, 20, prevents the ball, 16, from escaping, and also supports a coil spring, 22, and a inner rod, 24. A liquid piston, 26, creates a suction which draws the dishwashing composition past the ball, 16 and the plug, 20, into a liquid chamber, 28, and thereby primes the foam-generating dispenser, 10. Meanwhile, an air chamber, 30, and an air piston, 31 are also primed, and when the activator, 32, is depressed, both the air from the air chamber, 30, and the dishwashing composition from the liquid chamber, 28, are turbulently forced into the mixing chamber, 34, and past a first mesh, 36 and a second mesh, 38, which are both kept in place by a mesh holder, 40. As the turbulent air/dishwashing composition mixture is forced past the first mesh, 36, a first, rough foam is generated, which becomes more fine and even after passing through the second mesh, 38, and the third mesh, 41. These<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> meshes may have the same, or different pore sizes. Also, additional meshes may also be employed, as desired.</p><p num="p0022">In a preferred embodiment, the foam-generating dispenser contains a sponge therein or attached thereto, either in place of, or in addition to one or more meshes. A sponge also produces foam as the high surfactant composition is turbulently forced through its, open-celled structure. Such a sponge may be contained within the interior of the foam-generating dispenser and/or may also be located at the end of the nozzle, as desired. Without intending to be limited by theory, it has been found that additional meshes and/or a sponge located slightly within, and/or at the tip of the nozzle are especially useful herein, as they serve to generate the foam immediately prior to dispensing. Therefore, the user sees the desired foam as, or immediately after, it passes through the last turbulent flow area, while the foam quality is at its best and before it noticeably degrades and/or otherwise changes in quality.</p><p num="p0023">Fig. 1 also shows a base cap, 42, which secures the foaming dispenser to a container, 44, which holds the high surfactant composition.</p><p num="p0024">Preferred foam-generating dispensers useful herein include: T8900, OpAd FO, 8203, and 7512 series foamers from Afa-Polytek, Helmond, The Netherlands; T1, F2, and WR-F3 series foamers from Airspray International, Inc., Alkmaar, The Netherlands or North Pompano Beach, Florida, U.S.A.; TS-800 and Mixor series foamers from Saint-Gobain Calmar, Inc., City of Industry, California, U.S.A.; pump foamers and squeeze foamers from Daiwa Can Company, Tokyo, Japan; TS1 and TS2 series foamers from Guala Dispensing USA, Inc., Hillsborough, New Jersey, U.S.A.; and YT-87L-FP, YT-87L-FX, and YT-97 series foamers from Yoshino Kogyosho Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.

The effective foaming dilution range is calculated as follows: The suds generation curves of Graph I are generated by testing various dilutions of a dishwashing composition via the suds cylinder test herein. Such a curve can be generated either with or without dispensing from a foam-generating dispenser into the cylinders. "Effective foam" is defined herein as foam which is at least half (50%) the maximum volume of foam generated for a given dishwashing composition according to the suds generation curve. Accordingly, in Graph I for when the foam-generating dispenser is not employed, effective foam is formed from about 28% to about 2% product concentration, which translates into an effective foaming dilution range of 26% (i.e., 28% - 2%). However, when the same dishwashing composition is employed with (i.e., dispensed from) the foam-generating dispenser, it can be seen that effective foam is generated from the point of dispensing (100% product concentration) until a product concentration of about 3% is reached. This is because the dishwashing kit generates foam at a substantially different dishwashing composition to water dilution than the dilution at which the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> maximum volume of foam is formed according to the suds cylinder test. Thus, the effective foaming dilution range when the dishwashing composition in Graph I is dispensed from a foaming dispenser is 97% (i.e., 100% - 3%).

Accordingly, in Graph I, the maximum amount of oil solubilized is about 4.7 at a 70% product concentration, and thus the effective oil solubilization is an amount of at least about 0.94.

In contrast, when a foam-generating dispenser is employed, the effective foaming dilution range (from 3% to 100%) completely (100%) overlaps the entire effective oil solubilization dilution range (from 42% to 96%).

It has been found that if the foamed dishwashing composition is applied to a flat applicator, then the foamed dishwashing composition is quickly wiped onto the first dish contacted, but that little foamed dishwashing composition will remain on the flat applicator, for cleaning subsequent dishes. This makes the use of a foamed dishwashing composition both expensive, as composition mileage is significantly decreased, and tiresome, as new foamed dishwashing composition constantly needs to be applied to the flat applicator.

Formula F is a gel, while the other formulas are all liquids.
