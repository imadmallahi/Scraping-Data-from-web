Tyrosine kinases are believed, by way of substrate phosphorylation, to play critical roles in signal transduction for a number of cell functions. Though the exact mechanisms of signal transduction is still unclear, tyrosine kinases have been shown to be important contributing factors in cell proliferation, carcinogenesis and cell differentiation. Accordingly, inhibitors of these tyrosine kinases are useful for the prevention and treatment chemotherapy of proliferative diseases dependent on these enzymes.</p><p>For example, a method of treatment described herein relates to neoangiogenesis. Neoangiogenesis occurs in conjunction with tumor growth and in certain diseases of the eye. It is characterized by excessive activity of vascular endothelial growth factor.</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binds the high affinity membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase receptors KDR and Flt-1. Cell culture and gene knockout experiments indicate that each receptor contributes to different aspects of angiogenesis. KDR mediates the non-mitogenic function of VEGF whereas Flt-1 appears to modulate mitogenic functions such as those associated with cellular adhesion. Inhibiting KDR thus modulates the level of mitogenic VEGF activity.</p><p>Vascular growth in the retina leads to visual degeneration culminating in blindness. VEGF accounts for most of the angiogenic activity produced in or near the retina in diabetic retinopathy. Ocular VEGF MRNA and protein are elevated by conditions such as retinal vein occlusion in primates and decreased pO.sub.2 levels in mice that lead to neovascularization. Intraocular injections of anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or VEGF receptor immunofusions inhibit ocular neovascularization in both primate and rodent models. Regardless of the cause of induction of VEGF in human diabetic retinopathy, inhibition of ocular VEGF is useful in treating the disease.</p><p>Expression of VEGF is also significantly increased in hypoxic regions of animal and human tumors adjacent to areas of necrosis. Monoclonal anti-VEGF antibodies inhibit the growth of human tumors in nude mice. Although these same tumor cells continue to express VEGF in culture, the antibodies do not diminish their mitotic rate. Thus tumor-derived VEGF does not function as an autocrine mitogenic factor. Therefore, VEGF contributes to tumor growth in vivo by promoting angiogenesis through its paracrine vascular endothelial cell chemotactic and mitogenic activities. These monoclonal antibodies also inhibit the growth of typically less well vascularized human colon cancers in athymic mice and decrease the number of tumors arising from inoculated cells. Viral expression of a VEGF-binding construct of Flk-1, the mouse KDR receptor homologue, truncated to eliminate the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains but retaining a membrane anchor, virtually abolishes the growth of a transplantable glioblastoma in mice presumably by the dominant negative mechanism of heterodimer formation with membrane spanning endothelial cell VEGF receptors. Embryonic stem cells, which normally grow as solid tumors in nude mice, do not produce detectable tumors if both VEGF alleles are knocked out. Taken together, these data indicate the role of VEGF in the growth of solid tumors. Inhibition of KDR or Flt-1 is implicated in pathological neoangiogenesis, and these are useful in the treatment of diseases in which neoangiogenesis is part of the overall pathology, e.g., diabetic retinal vascularization, as well as various forms of cancer.</p><p>Cancers which are treatable in accordance with the present invention demonstrate high levels of gene and protein expression. Examples of such cancers include cancers of the brain, genitourinary tract, lymphatic system, stomach, larynx and lung. These include histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma and small cell lung cancers. Additional examples include cancers in which overexpression or activation of Raf-activating oncogenes (e.g., K-ras, erb-B) is observed. More particularly, such cancers include pancreatic and breast carcinoma.</p><p>The present invention relates to compounds which inhibit tyrosine kinase enzymes, compositions which contain tyrosine kinase inhibiting compounds and methods of using tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat tyrosine kinase-dependent diseases/conditions such as neoangiogenesis, cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy or inflammatory diseases, in mammals.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>A compound is disclosed in accordance with formula Ia: ##STR1## or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or prodrug thereof, wherein</p><p>X is N or C;</p><p>R.sub.1 &amp;

hydrate thereof in combination with a carrier. As used herein the terms "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" and "hydrates" refer to those salts and hydrated forms of the compound which would be apparent to the pharmaceutical chemist, i.e., those which favorably affect the physical or pharmacokinetic properties of the compound, such as solubility, palatability, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Other factors, more practical in nature, which are also important in the selection, are the cost of the raw materials, ease of crystallization, yield, stability, solubility, hygroscopicity and flowability of the resulting bulk drug.</p><p>When a compound of formula I is present as a salt or hydrate which is non-pharmaceutically acceptable, this can be converted to a salt or hydrate form which is pharmaceutically acceptable in accordance with the present invention.</p><p>When the compound is negatively charged, it is balanced by a counterion, e.g., an alkali metal cation such as sodium or potassium. Other suitable counterions include calcium, magnesium, zinc, ammonium, or alkylammonium cations such as tetramethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, choline, triethylhydroammonium, meglumine, triethanolhydroammonium, etc. An appropriate number of counterions is associated with the molecule to maintain overall charge neutrality. Likewise when the compound is positively charged, e.g., protonated, an appropriate number of negatively charged counterions is present to maintain overall charge neutrality.</p><p>Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include acid addition salts. Thus, the compound can be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids or bases. Examples include acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quatemized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl; and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the sulfate salt ethanolate and sulfate salts.</p><p>The compounds of the present invention, may have asymmetric centers and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures and as individual diastereomers, or enantiomers with all isomeric forms being included in the present invention. When any variable (e.g., aryl, heterocyle, R1, etc)occurs more than one time in any constituent or in Formula I, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The compounds of the invention can be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition by combining the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Examples of such compositions and carriers are set forth below.</p><p>The compounds may be employed in powder or crystalline form, in solution or in suspension. They may be administered orally, parenterally (intravenously or intramuscularly), topically, transdermally or by inhalation.</p><p>Thus, the carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Examples of liquid carriers include syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the carrier for oral use may include time delay material well known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax.</p><p>Topical applications may be formulated in carriers such as hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases to form ointments, creams, lotions, in aqueous, oleaginous or alcoholic liquids to form paints or in dry diluents to form powders. Such topical formulations can be used to treat ocular diseases as well as inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, delayed hypersensitivity reactions and the like.</p><p>Examples of oral solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, troches, lozenges and the like. The size of the dosage form will vary widely, but preferably will be from about 25 mg to about 500 mg. Examples of oral liquid dosage forms include solutions, suspensions, syrups, emulsions, soft gelatin capsules and the like. Examples of injectable dosage forms include sterile injectable liquids, e.g., solutions, emulsions and suspensions. Examples of injectable solids would include powders which are reconstituted, dissolved or suspended in a liquid prior to injection.</p><p>In injectable compositions, the carrier is typically comprised of sterile water, saline or another injectable liquid, e.g., peanut oil for intramuscular injections. Also, various buffering agents, preservatives and the like can be included.</p><p>For the methods of treatment disclosed herein, dosages can be varied depending upon the overall condition of the patient, the nature of the illness being treated and other factors. An example of a suitable oral dosage range is from about 0.1 to about 80 mg/kg per day, in single or divided doses. An example of a suitable parenteral dosage range is from about 0.1 to about 80 mg/kg per day, in single or divided dosages, administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection. An example of a topical dosage range is from about 0.1 mg to about 150 mg, applied externally from about one to four times a day. An example of an inhalation dosage range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg per day.</p><p>The examples which follow illustrate the compounds that can be synthesized but they are not limited by the compounds in the tables nor by any particular substituents employed in the schemes for illustrative purposes.</p><p>The compounds may be administered in conventional dosages as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutically active compounds.

In the assay described, quiescent HUVEC monolayers are treated with vehicle or test compound 2 hours prior to addition of VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

Three days after addition of [.sup.3 H]thymidine, medium is removed by aspiration, and cells are washed twice with Cell Wash Medium (400 ul/well followed by 200 ul/well). The washed, adherent cells are then solubilized by addition of Cell Lysis Solution (100 ul/well) and warming to 37 C. for 30 minutes. Cell lysates are transferred to 7-ml glass scintillation vials containing 150 ul of water. Scintillation cocktail (5 ml/vial) is added, and cell-associated radioactivity is determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.</p><p>Based upon the foregoing assays the compounds of formula I are inhibitors of VEGF and thus are useful for the inhibition of neoangiogenesis, such as in the treatment of occular disease, e.g., diabetic retinopathy and in the treatment of cancers, e.g., solid tumors. The instant compounds inhibit VEGF-stimulated mitogenesis of human vascular endothelial cells in culture with IC.sub.50 values between 150-650 nM. These compounds also show selectivity over related tyrosine kinases (e.g. FGFR1 and the Src family).</p></description><claims lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><claim-statement>What is claimed is:</claim-statement><claim num="1"><claim-text>1.
