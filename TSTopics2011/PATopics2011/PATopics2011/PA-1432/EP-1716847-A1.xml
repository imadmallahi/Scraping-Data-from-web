For such a bioabsorbable pharmaceutical formulation, a release sustaining base material, namely a biodegradable polymer is used. For example, Patent Document No.1 (as listed below) relates to a base material produced by the polycondensation of lactic acid and/or glycolic acid in the presence or absence of a catalyst; and Patent Document No.2 relates to a method for manufacturing a sustained release type microcapsule using a biodegradable polymer. Various kinds of polymer compounds using lactic acid and glycolic acid have also been studied, for example, Patent Document No.3 relates to a lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer which has a weight-average molecular weight of 5,000 or more and 30,000 or less, is free from a catalyst, has a dispersion degree of 1.5 to 2, and has a lactic acid content of 50 to 95 wt% and a glycolic acid content of 50 to 5 wt%; and Patent<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Document No.4 relates to a lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer which has a weight-average molecular weight of 8,000 or more and 15,000 or less, and a ratio of approximately 1.90 or less between a weight-average molecular weight and a number-average molecular weight. Further, Patent Document No.5 relates to a biodegradable aliphatic polyester which has a content of less than 3.0% for a low molecular polymer having a molecular weight of 1,000 or less.</p><p num="p0003">In addition, Patent Document Nos.6 and 7 relate to a distribution in molecular weight of a polymer suitable for a release sustaining base material; Patent Document No.8 relates to a use of a release sustaining formulation using a lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (having an intrinsic viscosity of 1.38 - 0.10); Patent Document No.9 relates to a method for preparing a release sustaining formulation with a copolymer of lactic acid-glycolic acid (having a molecular weight of 2,000 - 20,000); and Patent Document No. 10 relates to a use of a release sustaining formulation using a copolymer of lactic acid-glycolic acid (having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.3 or more).</p><p num="p0004">As stated above, referring to a bioabsorbable pharmaceutical formulation and a polymer suitable for its base material, diverse technologies have been disclosed, but there is no pharmaceutical formulation furnished with sufficient performance which prevents an effective drug component from being released rapidly just after the administration of the formulation, thereby allowing continued release of the drug for at least a month at a defined rate. To provide such a formulation is an object of the present invention.

The copolymer which has a glycolic acid content of 10 mole% or less is hydrolyzed too slowly to release a defined amount of a drug even one month after administration of the pharmaceutical formulation. In addition, the copolymer which has a glycolic acid content of beyond 60 mole% is low in solubility in an organic solvent that is generally used for a formulation, thereby creating an unfavorable effect brought about in the process for manufacturing the pharmaceutical formulation.</p><p num="p0012">The lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer of the present invention can be manufactured, but not limited to, by well known methods. For example, the method can include dehydration polycondensation from lactic acid and glycolic acid as cited in Polymeric Processing, 30(5), 208, (1981), or ring-opening polymerization from lactide and glycolide using a Lewis acid, a metal salt, an organometal and the like as a polymerization catalyst. A higher alcohol, a fatty acid and the like can also be used as an initiator.

Further, the lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer characterized by fraction contents for the molecular weights according to the present invention can be obtained more efficiently by "two step polymerization" wherein a monomer such as lactic acid and glycolic acid, or an oligomer comprising lactic acid and glycolic acid is added in the course of polymerization to continue further polymerization.

The organic solvent can be, for example, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, methylene chloride, chloroform, hexane, methanol or combinations thereof.

From the results shown in Table 3, it is demonstrated that the lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) having the molecular weight fractions of the present invention can be used to prevent a drug from being rapidly released, especially on a daily basis, as compared to PLGA of the comparative example.</p><heading>(Industrial Applicability)</heading><p num="p0043">As explained above, the lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer having the molecular weight fractions of the present invention can be used to provide a bioabsorbable pharmaceutical formulation which allows to restrain or prevent an effective component drug from being released rapidly just after the administration of the formulation and then continue releasing the drug for at least a month at a defined rate. The formulation allows a drug to exist at an optimal therapeutic blood level (at a therapeutic concentration of the blood) in order to be effective in the a body, within a range that is between the side effect expressing level and the minimum effective level, thereby resulting in a high effect based on a small dose (or frequency) of the formulation that is administered. Such a pharmaceutical formulation can be applied to lower the administration frequency, allowing exemption of a patient from the burden of suffering multiple administrations. In addition, the formulation can prevent a drug from being released too rapidly just after the administration, thereby allowing effective utilization of the drug to be free from the side effect and from the wasteful dosage.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A bioabsorbable pharmaceutical formulation comprising a lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and a drug, wherein the lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer has the following fraction contents for their respective molecular weights determined by gel-permeation chromatography:
