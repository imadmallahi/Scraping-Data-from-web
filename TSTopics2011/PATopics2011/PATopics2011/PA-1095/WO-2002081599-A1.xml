However, there are several limitations to using crude oil as a fuel source. For example, crude oil is in limited supply, includes aromatic compounds believed to cause cancer, and contains sulfur and nitrogen-containing compounds that can adversely affect the environment.</p><p num="p0004">Alternative sources for developing combustible liquid fuel are desirable. One option is to convert natural gas to liquid fuel or other chemical products. The conversion of natural gas to liquid fuel typically involves converting the natural gas, which is mostly methane, to synthesis gas, or syngas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is an example of a hydrocarbon synthesis that converts the syngas to higher molecular weight hydrocarbon products. An advantage of using fuels prepared from syngas is that they typically do not contain nitrogen and sulfur and generally do not contain aromatic compounds. Accordingly, they have less health and environmental impact than conventional petroleum liquids based fuels.</p><p num="p0005">Fischer-Tropsch synthesis products tend to include a large amount of high molecular weight linear paraffins (wax), which can be hydrocracked to form lower molecular weight products, and optionally subjected to additional hydroprocessing steps. Multiple catalyst beds with intermediate cooling stages are commonly used to control the extremely exothermic hydrocracking reaction. Multiple beds are used to introduce a cooling quench (typically a gas, most often a hydrogen-containing gas) and to allow re-mixing of the reactor gas and liquids to allow for more efficient catalyst utilization and smoother/safer operation. Numerous means are known for mixing the gas/gas, liquid/liquid and gas/liquid mixtures between catalysts beds,

A stream of relatively cool hydrogen-containing gas is introduced between the beds to provide the desired quenching (cooling) of the exothermic hydrocracking reactions.</p><p num="p0008">Gas has been a preferred quench fluid because of the relative ease in distributing across the reactor cross-section, its function as a reactant in the upgrading process, and the availability at reactor conditions downstream of the plant recycle and/or make-up hydrogen compressors. A limitation of using gases as the quench fluid is its relatively low heat capacity. Additionally, the use of hydrogen requires the presence of relatively expensive recirculation pumps.</p><p num="p0009">It would be advantageous to provide methods for using additional quench streams when hydrocracking FT synthesis products. The present invention provides such methods.</p><p num="p0010">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method for hydroprocessing Fischer- Tropsch products. The invention in particular relates to an integrated method for producing liquid fuels from a hydrocarbon stream provided by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The method involves separating the Fischer-Tropsch products into a light fraction with normal boiling points below 700°F and including predominantly Cs<sub>-2</sub>o components and a heavy fraction with normal boiling points above 650°F and including predominantly C<sub>20</sub>+ of components. The heavy fraction is subjected to hydrocracking conditions, preferably through multiple catalyst beds, to reduce the chain length. The light fraction is used as all or part of a quench fluid between each catalyst bed.</p><p num="p0011">The products from the hydroprocessing reaction can be separated into at least a hydrogen-rich gas stream, a distillate product predominantly in the C<sub>5-2</sub>o range, and a bottoms stream.

example, to prepare a lube base oil stock. When used to prepare a lube base oil stock, it can be subjected to catalytic dewaxing and/or solvent dewaxing conditions.</p><p num="p0012">In one embodiment, the heavy fraction and/or the light fraction include hydrocarbons in the same range derived from other sources, for example, petroleum refining.</p><p num="p0013">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The figure is an illustrative schematic flow diagram representing one preferred embodiment of the invention, but the invention is applicable to all appropriate refineries and/or chemical processes.</p><p num="p0014">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method for hydroprocessing Fischer- Tropsch products. The invention in particular relates to an integrated method for producing liquid fuels from a hydrocarbon stream provided by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which in turn involves the initial conversion of a light hydrocarbon stream to syngas and conversion of the syngas to higher molecular weight hydrocarbon products.</p><p num="p0015">The method involves subjecting a heavy fraction derived from a Fischer-Tropsch process to hydrocracking conditions, preferably through multiple catalyst beds, to reduce the chain length. A light fraction derived from a Fischer-Tropsch process is used as a quench fluid to remove excess heat from the hydrocracked products. In one embodiment, the light fraction may be injected between catalyst beds in the reactor. Optionally, the light fraction can be combined with the effluent from the hydrocracking beds (the "hydrocrackate") and the combined fractions hydrotreated or otherwise hydroprocessed. The heavy fraction which is used in the present process may be a stream from a Fischer-Tropsch reaction, or a fraction produced by fractionating a Fischer-Tropsch reaction product. The light fraction may also be a stream from a Fischer-Tropsch reaction, or a fraction produced by fractionating a Fischer-Tropsch reaction product 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 The present method is advantageous for many reasons. The light fraction quenches the high temperature hydrocracking products, minimizing or eliminating the need for hydrogen as a quench fluid, and also minimizing or eliminating the need for hydrogen recycle pumps downstream. The hydrocracking of the light fraction is minimized, relative to the case where the entire C<sub>5</sub>+ fraction from a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is subjected to similar hydrocracking conditions. The isolation of products in the desired C<sub>5</sub>. o range, for example, mid-distillates, can be enhanced by minimizing the hydrocracking of Fischer-Tropsch products in the C<sub>5-2</sub>o range. Further, by removing the light fraction from the feed to the hydrocracking reactor, the throughput of predominantly C<sub>20</sub>+ hydrocarbons to the reactor is increased. The methods allow for heat exchange between the relatively high temperature hydrocracking products and the relatively cool light fraction. This heat exchange cools the hydrocracking products down to the desired hydrotreatment temperature while minimizing the need for hydrogen compressors. In one aspect, the methods reduce the number of reactor vessels and/or hydrogen compressors/recycle pumps required for hydroprocessing in a refinery. The methods can also extend the life of the hydrocracking catalyst by minimizing contact of the C<sub>5</sub>.<sub>2</sub>0 fraction with the hydrocracking catalysts.</p><p num="p0016">Definitions</p><p num="p0017">Light hydrocarbon feedstock: These feedstocks can include methane, ethane, propane, butane and mixtures thereof.

In addition to methane, natural gas includes some heavier hydrocarbons (mostly C<sub>2-5</sub> paraffins) and other impurities, e.g., mercaptans and other sulfur-containing compounds, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, water and non-hydrocarbon acid gases. Natural gas fields also typically contain a significant amount of C<sub>5</sub>+ material, which is liquid at ambient conditions.</p><p num="p0033">The methane, and optionally ethane and or other hydrocarbons, can be isolated and used to generate syngas.

Typically, synthesis gas contains hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and may include minor amounts of carbon ' dioxide, water, unconverted light hydrocarbon feedstock and various other impurities. The presence of sulfur, nitrogen, halogen, selenium, phosphorus and arsenic contaminants in the syngas is undesirable. For this reason, it is preferred to remove sulfur and other contaminants from the feed before performing the Fischer-Tropsch chemistry or other hydrocarbon synthesis. Means for removing these contaminants are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, ZnO guard beds are preferred for removing sulfur impurities. Means for removing other contaminants are well known to those of skill in the art.

 Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis</p><p num="p0035">Catalysts and conditions for performing Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are well known to those of skill in the art, and are described, for example, in EP 0 921 184 Al, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process, liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons are formed by contacting a synthesis gas (syngas) comprising a mixture of H and CO with a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst under suitable temperature and pressure reactive conditions. The Fischer-Tropsch reaction is typically conducted at temperatures of about from 300° to 700°F (149 to 371°C) preferably about from 400° to 550°F (204° to 228°C); pressures of about from 10 to 600 psia, (0.7 to 41 bars) preferably 30 to 300 psia, (2 to 21 bars) and catalyst space velocities of about from 100 to 10,000 cc/g/hr., preferably 300 to 3,000 cc/g/hr.</p><p num="p0036">The products may range from Ci to C<sub>20</sub>o+ with a majority in the C5-C1.00+ range. The reaction can be conducted in a variety of reactor types for example, fixed bed reactors containing one or more catalyst beds, slurry reactors, fluidized bed reactors, or a combination of different type reactors. Such reaction processes and reactors are well known and documented in the literature. Slurry Fischer-Tropsch processes, which is a preferred process in the practice of the invention, utilize superior heat (and mass) transfer characteristics for the strongly exothermic synthesis reaction and are able to produce relatively high molecular weight, paraffinic hydrocarbons when using a cobalt catalyst. In a slurry process, a syngas comprising a mixture of H<sub>2</sub> and CO is bubbled up as a third phase through a slurry in a reactor which comprises a particulate Fischer-Tropsch type hydrocarbon synthesis catalyst dispersed and suspended in a slurry liquid comprising hydrocarbon products of the synthesis reaction which are liquid at the reaction conditions. The mole ratio of the hydrogen to the carbon monoxide may broadly range from about 0.5 to 4, but is more typically within the range of from about 0.7 to 2.75 and preferably from about 0.7 to 2.5. A particularly preferred Fischer-Tropsch process is taught in EP0609079, also completed incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Suitable Fischer-Tropsch catalysts comprise on or more Group VIII catalytic metals such as Fe, Ni, Co, Ru and Re. Additionally, a suitable catalyst may contain 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
a promoter. Thus, a preferred Fischer-Tropsch catalyst comprises effective amounts of cobalt and one or more of Re, Ru, Pt, Fe, Ni, Th, Zr, Hf, U, Mg and La on a suitable inorganic support material, preferably one which comprises one or more refractory metal oxides. In general, the amount of cobalt present in the catalyst is between about 1 and about 50 weight percent of the total catalyst composition. The catalysts can also contain basic oxide promoters such as ThO<sub>2</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO, and TiO<sub>2</sub>, promoters such as ZrO<sub>2</sub>, noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Os, Ir), coinage metals (Cu, Ag, Au), and other transition metals such as Fe, Mn, Ni, and Re. Support materials including alumina, silica, magnesia and titania or mixtures thereof may be used. Preferred supports for cobalt containing catalysts comprise titania. Useful catalysts and their preparation are known and illustrative, but nonlimiting examples may be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,663.</p><p num="p0037">Product Isolation from Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis The products from Fischer-Tropsch reactions performed in slurry bed reactors generally include a light reaction product and a waxy reaction product. The light reaction product (a predominantly C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>o fraction, commonly termed the "condensate fraction") includes hydrocarbons boiling below about 700°F(e.g., tail gases through middle distillates), with decreasing amounts up to about C<sub>30</sub>. The waxy reaction product (a predominantly C<sub>20</sub>+ fraction, commonly termed the "wax fraction") includes hydrocarbons boiling above about 600°F (e.g., vacuum gas oil through heavy paraffins), with decreasing amounts down to C<sub>10</sub>. Both the light reaction product and the waxy product are substantially paraffinic. The waxy product generally comprises greater than 70% normal paraffins, and often greater than 80% normal paraffins. The light reaction product comprises paraffinic products with a significant proportion of alcohols and olefins. In some cases, the light reaction product may comprise as much as 50%, and even higher, alcohols and olefins. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 Additional Hydrocarbon Streams</p><p num="p0038">The light and heavy fractions described above can optionally be combined with hydrocarbons from other streams, for example, streams from petroleum refining. The light fractions can be combined, for example, with similar fractions obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil. The heavy fractions can be combined, for example, with waxy crude oils, crude oils and/or slack waxes from petroleum deoiling and dewaxing operations.</p><p num="p0039">Optional Treatment of the Light Fraction Before Use as a Quench Fluid The light fraction typically includes a mixture of hydrocarbons, including mono-olefins and alcohols. The mono-olefins are typically present in an amount of at least about 5.0 wt % of the lighter fraction. The alcohols are usually present in an amount typically of at least about 0.5 wt % or more.</p><p num="p0040">The pressurized fraction can be mixed with a hydrogen-containing gas stream, in those embodiments where the quench fluid is a combination of a hydrogen-containing gas and the light fraction. When the fraction is heated upon combination with the heated hydrocracking stream, the olefins may form heavy molecular weight products, such as polymers. Adding even a small amount (i.e., less than about 500 SCFB) of hydrogen-containing gas to the fraction before it is heated by the hydrocrackate prevents or minimizes formation of the undesirable heavier molecular weight products.</p><p num="p0041">The source of hydrogen can be virtually any hydrogen-containing gas that does not include significant amounts of impurities that would adversely affect the hydrotreatment catalysts. In particular, the hydrogen-containing gas includes sufficient amounts of hydrogen to achieve the desired effect, and may include other gases that are not harmful to the formation of desired end products and that do not promote or accelerate fouling of the downstream catalysts and hydrotreatment equipment. Examples of possible hydrogen-containing gases include hydrogen gas and syngas. The hydrogen can be from a hydrogen plant, recycle gas in a hydroprocessing unit and the like. Alternately, the hydrogen-containing gas may be a portion of the hydrogen used for hydrocracking the wax fraction. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 After the hydrogen-containing gas is introduced into the fraction, the fraction can be pre-heated, if necessary, in a heat exchanger. The methods of heating the fractions in the heat exchangers can include any methods known to practitioners in the art. For example, a shell and tube heat exchanger may be used, wherein a heated substance, such as steam or a reaction product from elsewhere in the method, is fed through an outer shell, providing heat to the fraction in an inner tube, thus heating the fraction and cooling the heated substance in the shell. Alternately, the fraction may be heated directly by passing through a heated tube, wherein the heat may be supplied by electricity, combustion, or any other source known to practitioners in the art.</p><p num="p0042">Hydroprocessing Reactors</p><p num="p0043">Hydrocracking generally refers to breaking down the high molecular weight components of hydrocarbon feed to form other, lower molecular weight products. Hydrotreatment hydrogenates double bonds, reduces oxygenates to paraffins, and desulfurizes and denitrifies hydrocarbon feeds. Hydroisomerization converts at least a portion of the linear paraffins into isoparaffins.</p><p num="p0044">In hydrocracking reactions, pressures and temperatures are often close to the limit the reactors can handle. Multiple catalyst beds with intermediate cooling stages are typically used to control the extremely exothermic hydrocracking reaction. The hydrotreating and hydrocracking reactions begin as soon as the feed contacts the catalyst. Because the reactions are exothermic, the temperature of the reaction mixture increases and the catalyst beds heat up as the mixture passes through the beds and the reactions proceed. In order to limit the temperature rise and control the reaction rate, a quench fluid is introduced into the catalytic reaction zone within the reactor, generally between the catalyst beds.</p><p num="p0045">Ideally, there is less than a 100°F temperature rise in each bed, preferably less than about 50°F per bed, with cooling stages used to bring the temperature back to a manageable level. The heated effluent from each bed is mixed with the quench fluid in a suitable mixing device (sometimes referred to as an inter-bed redistributor or a mixer/distributor) to cool the effluent sufficiently so that it can be sent through the next catalyst bed. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 The quench fluid includes the light fraction and optionally other fluids, for example, (pressurized) hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is typically introduced at around 150°F or above, which is extremely cold relative to the reactant temperatures (typically between 650° and 750°F). When multiple catalyst beds are used, the quench fluid is used in the intermediate cooling stages. After the final hydrocracking bed, rather than quenching the hydrocrackate in an intermediate bed, it can be combined with the quench fluid and the combined fractions hydrotreated. Reactor internals between the catalysts beds are designed to ensure both a thorough mixing of the reactants with the quench fluid and a good distribution of vapor and liquid flowing to the next catalyst bed. Good distribution of the reactants prevents hot spots and excessive naphtha and gas make, and maximizes catalyst life. This is particularly important where the heavy fraction includes an appreciable amount of olefins, which makes it highly reactive. Poor distribution and mixing can result in non-selective cracking of the wax to light gas. Examples of suitable mixing devices are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,837,208, U.S. Patent No. 5,690,896, U.S. Patent No. 5,462,719 and U.S. Patent No. 5,484,578, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. A preferred mixing device is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,690,896.</p><p num="p0046">The reactor includes a means for introducing the light fraction to the inter- bed redistributors so that they can be used as (all or part of) a quenching fluid. Preferably, the fraction is introduced as a liquid rather than a gas, to better absorb heat from the heated hydrocrackate. The redistributors are generally placed between catalyst beds, for redistributing the fluids passing from catalyst bed to catalyst bed, and the fluids optionally added to the redistributor (e.g. a hydrogen containing gas or a liquid stream) from outside the reactor. Redistributors are well known in the art (e.g. U.S. Patent No. 5,690,896).</p><p num="p0047">Preferably, the reactor is a downflow reactor that includes at least two catalyst beds, with inter-bed redistributors between the beds. The top bed(s) include a hydrocracking catalyst and, optionally, one or more beds include a hydroisomerization and/or hydrotreatment catalyst. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 In one embodiment, the products of the hydrocracking reaction can be removed between beds, with continuing reaction of the remaining stream in subsequent beds. U.S. Patent No. 3,172,836 discloses a liquid vapor separation zone located between two catalyst beds for withdrawing a gaseous fraction and a liquid fraction from a first catalyst bed. Such techniques can be used if desired to isolate products. However, since the products of the hydrocracking reaction are typically gaseous at the reaction temperature, the residence time of the gaseous products on the catalyst beds is sufficiently low, and further hydrocracking of the product would be expected to be minimal, so product isolation is not required. The catalysts and conditions for performing hydrocracking, hydroisomerization and hydrotreating reactions are discussed in more detail below.</p><p num="p0048">Hydrocracking</p><p num="p0049">The heavy fractions described above can be hydrocracked using conditions well known to those of skill in the art. In a preferred embodiment, hydrocracking conditions involve passing a feed stream, such as the heavy fraction, through a plurality of hydrocracking catalyst beds under conditions of elevated temperature and/or pressure. The plurality of catalyst beds may function to remove impurities such as any metals and other solids which may be present, and/or to crack or convert the feedstock. Hydrocracking is a process of breaking longer carbon chain molecules into smaller ones. It can be effected by contacting the particular fraction or combination of fractions, with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable hydrocracking catalyst at hydrocracking conditions, including temperatures in the range of about from 600° to 900°F (316° to 482°C) preferably 650° to 850°F (343° to 454°C) and pressures in the range about from 200 to 4000 psia (13-272 atm) preferably 500 to 3000 psia (34-204 atm) using space velocities based on the hydrocarbon feedstock of about 0.1 to 10 hr<sup>"1</sup> preferably 0.25 to 5 hr<sup>"1</sup>. In general, hydrocracking catalysts include a cracking component and a hydrogenation component on an oxide support material or binder. The cracking component may include an amorphous cracking component and/or a zeolite, such as a Y-type zeolite, an ultrastable Y-type zeolite or a dealuminated zeolite. A suitable amorphous cracking component is silica-alumina.

 The hydrogenation component of the catalyst particles is selected from those elements known to provide catalytic hydrogenation activity. At least one metal component selected from the Group VIII (IUPAC notation) elements and/or from the Group VI (IUPAC notation) elements are generally chosen. Group VI elements include chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. Group VHI elements include iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. The amount(s) of hydrogenation component(s) in the catalyst suitable range from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of Group VIII metal component(s) and from about 5% to about 25% by weight of Group VI metal comρonent(s), calculated as metal oxide(s) per 100 parts by weight of total catalyst, where the percentages by weight are based on the weight of the catalyst before sulfiding. The hydrogenation components in the catalyst may be in the oxidic and/or the sulfidic form. If a combination of at least a Group VI and a Group VIII metal component is present as (mixed) oxides, it will be subjected to a sulfiding treatment prior to proper use in hydrocracking. Suitably, the catalyst iricludes one or more components of nickel and/or cobalt and one or more components of molybdenum and/or tungsten and one or more components of platinum and/or palladium. Catalysts containing nickel and molybdenum, nickel and tungsten, platinum and/or palladium are particularly preferred.

Examples of suitable binders include silica, alumina, clays, zirconia, titania, magnesia and silica-alumina. Preference is given to the use of alumina as a binder. Other components, such as phosphorous, may be added as desired to tailor the catalyst particles for a desired application. The blended components are then shaped, such as by extrusion, dried and calcined at temperatures up to 1200°F (649°C) to produce the finished catalyst particles. Alternatively, equally suitable methods for preparing the amorphous catalyst particles include preparing oxide binder particles, for example, by extrusion, drying and calcining, followed by depositing the hydrogenation metals on the oxide particles, using methods such as
