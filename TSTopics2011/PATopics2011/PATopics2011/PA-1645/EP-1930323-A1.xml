When used to treat such disorders, muscarinic receptor antagonists are typically administered by inhalation. However, even when administered by inhalation, a significant amount of the muscarinic receptor antagonist is often absorbed into the systemic circulation resulting in systemic side effects, such as dry mouth, mydriasis and cardiovascular side effects.</p><p num="p0004">Additionally, many inhaled muscarinic receptor antagonists have a relatively short duration of action requiring that they be administered several times per day. Such a multiple-daily dosing regime is not only inconvenient but also creates a significant risk of inadequate treatment due to patient non-compliance with the required frequent dosing schedule.</p><p num="p0005">Accordingly, a need exists for new muscarinic receptor antagonists. In particular, a need exists for new muscarinic receptor antagonists that having high potency and reduced systemic side effects when administered by inhalation. Additionally, a need exists for inhaled muscarinic receptor antagonists having a long duration of action thereby allowing for once-daily or even once-weekly dosing. Such compounds are expected to be particularly effective for treating pulmonary disorders, such as COPD and asthma, while<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> reducing or eliminating side effects, such as dry-mouth and constipation.</p><heading><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="p0006">The present invention provides novel biphenyl compounds having muscarinic receptor antagonist or anticholinergic activity. Among other properties, compounds of this invention have been found to possess high potency and reduced systemic side effects when administered by inhalation and to have a long duration of action.</p><p num="p0007">Accordingly, in one of its composition aspects, this invention provides a compound of formula I:

Test compound or vehicle were dosed via inhalation (IH) over a 10 minute time period in a pie shaped dosing chamber (R&amp;S Molds, San Carlos, CA). Test solutions were dissolved in sterile water and delivered using a nebulizer filled with 5.0 mL of dosing solution. Guinea pigs were restrained in the inhalation chamber for 30 minutes. During this time, guinea pigs were restricted to an area of approximately 110 sq. cm. This space was adequate for the animals to turn freely, reposition themselves, and allow for grooming. Following 20 minutes of acclimation, guinea pigs were exposed to an aerosol generated from a LS Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, VA) driven by house air at a pressure of 22 psi. Upon completion of nebulization, guinea pigs were evaluated at 1.5, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 hrs after treatment.<!-- EPO <DP n="71"> --></p><p num="p0292">Guinea pigs were anesthetized one hour before testing with an intramuscular (IM) injection of a mixture of ketamine 43.75 mg/kg, xylazine 3.5 mg/kg, and acepromazine 1.05 mg/kg at an 0.88 mL/kg volume. Animals were placed ventral side up on a heated (37°C) blanket at a 20 degree incline with their head in a downward slope. A 4-ply 2 x 2 inch gauze pad (Nu-Gauze General-use sponges, Johnson and Johnson, Arlington, TX) was inserted in the guinea pig's mouth. Five minutes later, the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (3.0 mg/kg, SC) was administered and the gauze pad was immediately discarded and replaced by a new pre-weighed gauze pad. Saliva was collected for 10 minutes, at which point the gauze pad was weighed and the difference in weight recorded to determine the amount of accumulated saliva (in mg). The mean amount of saliva collected for animals receiving the vehicle and each dose of test compound was calculated. The vehicle group mean was considered to be 100% salivation. Results were calculated using result means (n = 3 or greater). Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated for each dose at each time point using two-way ANOVA.

Under isoflurane anesthesia (to effect), animals were instrumented with common carotid artery and jugular vein catheters (PE-50 tubing). The catheters were exteriorized utilizing a subcutaneous tunnel to the subscapular area. All surgical incisions were sutured with 4-0 Ethicon Silk and the catheters locked with heparin (1000 units/mL). Each animal was administered saline (3 mL, SC) at the end of surgery as well as buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, IM). Animals were allowed to recover on a heating pad before being returned to their holding rooms.</p><p num="p0296">Approximately 18 to 20 hours following surgery, the animals were weighed and the carotid artery catheter on each animal was connected to a transducer for recording arterial pressure. Arterial pressure and heart rate was recorded using a Biopac MP-100 Acquisition System. Animals were allowed to acclimate and stabilize for a period of 20 minutes.</p><p num="p0297">Each animal was challenged with MCh (0.3 mg/kg, IV) administered through the jugular venous line and the cardiovascular response was monitored for 10 minutes. The animals were then placed into the whole body dosing chamber, which was connected to a nebulizer containing the test compound or vehicle solution. The solution was nebulized for 10 minutes using a gas mixture of breathable air and 5% carbon dioxide with a flow rate of 3 liters/minute. The animals were then removed from the whole body chamber and returned to their respective cages. At 1.5 and 24 hours post-dosing, the animals were rechallenged with MCh (0.3 mg/kg, IV) and the hemodynamic response was determined. Thereafter, the animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, IV).</p><p num="p0298">MCh produces a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decrease in heart rate (bradycardia). The peak decrease, from baseline, in MAP (depressor responses) was measured for each MCh challenge (before and after IH dosing). The bradycardic effects were not used for analysis since these responses were not robust and reproducible. The effects of treatment on the MCh responses are expressed as % inhibition (mean +/- SEM) of the control depressor responses. Two-way ANOVA with the appropriate post-hoc test was used to test the effects of treatment and pre-treatment time. The depressor responses to MCh were relatively unchanged at 1.5 and 24 hours after inhalation dosing with vehicle.</p><p num="p0299">The ratio of the anti-depressor TD<sub>50</sub> to bronchoprotective ID<sub>50</sub> was used to compute<!-- EPO <DP n="73"> --> apparent lung-selectivity of the test compound.
