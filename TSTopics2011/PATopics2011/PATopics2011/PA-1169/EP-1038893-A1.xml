load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p>A process for producing polypropylene having increased
melt strength, the process comprising irradiating polypropylene
with an electron beam having an energy of at least 5 MeV in the
presence of a grafting agent for forming long chain branches on
the polypropylene molecules.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for the production
of polypropylene having improved properties, in particular high
melt strength, recovery compliance and/or relaxation time. In
particular, the present invention relates to a process for the
production of propylene having improved properties by irradiating
polypropylene with a high energy electron beam.</p><p num="0002">Polypropylene resin is used in a variety of different
applications. However, polypropylene resin suffers from the
problem of having a low melt strength, which restricts the use
of polypropylene in a number of applications because the
polypropylene is difficult to process. It is known in the art
to increase the melt strength of polypropylene, for example by
irradiating the polypropylene with an electron beam. It is known
that electron beam irradiation significantly modifies the
structure of a polypropylene molecule. The irradiation of
polypropylene results in chain scission and grafting (or
branching) which can occur simultaneously. Up to a certain level
of irradiation dose, it is possible to produce from a linear
polypropylene molecule having been produced using a Ziegler-Natta
catalyst, a modified polymer molecule having free-end long
branches, otherwise known as long chain branching.</p><p num="0003">For example, US-A-5554668 discloses a process for
irradiating polypropylene to increase the melt strength thereof.
An increase in the melt strength is achieved by decreasing the
melt flow rate, otherwise known as the melt index. It is
disclosed that a linear propylene polymer material is irradiated
with high energy ionising radiation, preferably an electron beam,
at a dose rate in the range of from about 1 to 1x10<sup>4</sup> Mrads per
minute for a period of time sufficient for a substantial amount
of chain scission of the linear, propylene polymer molecule to 
occur but insufficient to cause gelation of the material.
Thereafter, the material is maintained for a period of time
sufficient for a significant amount of long chain branches to
form. Finally, the material is treated to deactivate
substantially all free radicals present in the irradiated
material. It is disclosed that for an electron beam, the
electrons are beamed from an electron generator having an
accelerating potential (<i>i.e.</i> an energy) of from 500 to 4000
kilovolts. Typically, the polypropylene material to be
irradiated is in particulate form and is conveyed on a conveyor
belt beneath an electron beam generator which continuously
irradiates the polypropylene particles as they are translated
thereunder by the conveyor belt. The resultant polyethylene has
improved melt strength as represented by a decrease in the melt
flow rate. A disadvantage of the process disclosed in US-A-5554668
is that the production rate of the irradiated
polypropylene is relatively low, because the speed of the
conveyor belt is low and only a small volume of material is
processed. This results in difficulties in commercial
implementation of the process. In addition, the specification
discloses the use of a very broad range of dose rates i.e. from
1 to 1x10<sup>4</sup> Mrads per minute. High dose rates of greater than
about 40 Mrad can result in a substantially fully cross-linked
structure of the polypropylene. Such a cross-linked structure
is difficult to process.</p><p num="0004">CA-A-2198651 discloses a continuous method for producing
polypropylene mixtures of increased stress-crack resistance and
melt strength in which a low-energy electron beam accelerator
with an energy of from 150 to 300 keV at a radiation dose of 0.05
to 12 Mrads is employed. This process also suffers from the
disadvantage that the production rate of the irradiated powder
can be somewhat low for commercial acceptance. Moreover, the
polypropylene powder to be irradiated must be in the form of very
fine particles. The specification discloses that bifunctional,
unsaturated monomers can be added before and/or during the
irradiation. Such compounds may include divinyl compounds, alkyl 
compounds, dienes, or mixtures thereof. These bifunctional,
unsaturated monomers can be polymerised with the help of free
radicals during the irradiation. Butadiene is particularly
preferred.</p><p num="0005">EP-A-0520773 discloses an expandable polyolefin resin
composition including polypropylene optionally blended with
polyethylene. In order to prepare a cross-linked foam, a sheet
of expandable resin composition is irradiated with ionising
radiation to cross-link the resin. The ionising radiation may
include electron rays, at a dose of from 1 to 20 Mrad. It is
disclosed that auxiliary cross-linking agents may be employed
which include a bifunctional monomer, exemplified by 1,9-nonanediol
dimethyacrylate.</p><p num="0006">US-A-2948666 and US-A-5605936 disclose processes for
producing irradiated polypropylene.</p><p num="0007">The present invention aims to provide a process for
producing polypropylene resins having improved properties, in
particular improved melt strength, which can be manufactured at
a higher production rate than heretofore disclosed in the above-specified
prior art documents. It is also an aim of the
invention to provide such a process which provides substantially
increased long chain branching on the polypropylene molecules
following the irradiation, while employing relatively low
irradiation doses. It is a further aim to produce polypropylene
having not only improved melt strength, but also improved
recovery compliance and relaxation time.</p><p num="0008">It is also known to irradiate polypropylene copolymers of
propylene and dienes for example 1,5-hexadiene before
polymerisation. The use of such copolymer complicates
substantially the polymerisation procedure.</p><p num="0009">Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for
producing polypropylene having increased melt strength, the 
process comprising irradiating polypropylene with an electron
beam having an energy of at least 5 MeV in the presence of a
grafting agent for forming long chain branches on the
polypropylene molecules.</p><p num="0010">The present invention is predicated on the discovery by the
present inventor that high irradiation energy electron beams
enable high throughput of polypropylene to be irradiated, thereby
making irradiation more commercially useful, and that the problem
of a low level of branching on pure polypropylene as a result of
such high energies can be overcome by using a grafting agent
which substantially increases the branching index of the
irradiated polymer while rather low irradiation doses are
required.</p><p num="0011">Preferably, the polypropylene is irradiated at an energy of
at least 10 MeV.</p><p num="0012">The polypropylene may be a homopolymer of propylene or a
random or block copolymer of propylene and one or more olefins
and/or dienes selected from ethylene and C<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>10</sub> 1-olefins or
dienes, which may be linear or branched. The polypropylene
homopolymer may be reinforced by rubber particles, for example
ethylene-propylene rubber particles, typically in an amount of
up to 30wt%. The polypropylene may be a terpolymer optionally
with a diene, for example norbornadiene, as a comonomer.</p><p num="0013">Preferably, the polypropylene to be irradiated is mixed
prior to irradiation with the grafting agent which increases the
long chain branching of the propylene molecules as a result of
the irradiation. The grafting agent is directly incorporated
into the propylene molecule during the irradiation step. The
grafting agent includes at least one carbon-carbon double bond,
and preferably is polyunsaturated, being for example bi, ter or
tetra unsaturated. The non-conjugated unsaturated compounds are
preferred, although conjugated saturated compounds may be
employed. The grafting agent may contain polar groups, such as 
ester, anhydride, or imide groups and/or non-metallic elements
such as silicon, phosphorous and halogen atoms. The grafting
agent may be selected from the group consisting of bismaleimide
derivatives; mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-acrylate or methacrylate
compounds; organosilane compounds of the formula A<sub>4-n</sub>SiR<sub>n</sub> where A
are identical or different acrylate or methacrylate or vinyl
groups, where R are identical or different alkoxy or acetoxy
groups and where n is 1, 2, 3 or 4; α,β-unsaturated acids and
their anhydride derivatives; non-conjugated dienes such as 1,5-hexadiene,
norbornadiene and dicyclopentadiene; dipentene;
polybutadiene and copolymers containing polybutadiene blocks;
butadiene based polymers and copolymers; polyisoprene and
copolymers containing polyisoprene blocks; isoprene based
polymers and copolymers; polyethylene; C<sub>4-20</sub> α-olefins either
linear or branched; styrene or divinylbenzene; ethylene-propylene
rubbers and ethylene-propylene-diene rubbers; di-furnane
derivatives; ester derivatives of fatty acids; and
vinylpolybutadiene.</p><p num="0014">A particularly preferred grafting agent comprises tetravinyl
silane.</p><p num="0015">The grafting agent employed in accordance with a preferred
aspect of the invention results, following irradiation, in
polypropylene molecules having some free end terminations, with
a cross-link density which is not so high as to reduce the
processability of the polymer.</p><p num="0016">In a further preferred aspect, functional monomers such as
maleic anhydride, styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 1,4-butanediol
diacrylate, or ethylene glycol dimethacrylate may be
incorporated into the polypropylene resin. These functional
comonomers promote long chain branching of the polypropylene
molecules.</p><p num="0017">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention,
polypropylene homopolymer in fluff or powder form in an oxygen-free
environment is mixed with a grafting agent. Preferably, the 
grafting agent comprises from 0.01 to 5 wt% of the weight of the
polypropylene, more preferably from 0.01 to 1 wt% of the weight
of the polypropylene. A particularly preferred grafting agent
comprises tetravinyl silane in an amount of from 0.01 to 1wt%
based on the weight of the polypropylene, most particularly from
0.01 to 0.5 wt% based on the weight of the polypropylene.</p><p num="0018">The polypropylene/grafting agent mixture is thereafter
deposited onto a continuously moving conveyor such as an endless
belt. The mixture on the conveyor passes under an electron beam
generator which irradiates the mixture. Preferably, the
accelerating potential or energy of the electron beam is at least
5 MeV, more preferably from 5 to 100 MeV, still more preferably
at least 10 MeV, yet more preferably from 10 to 25 MeV. The
power of the electron beam generator is preferably from 50 to 500
kW more preferably for 120 to 250 kW. The radiation dose to
which the polypropylene/ grafting agent mixture is subjected is
preferably from 5 to 100 kGray, preferably around 15 kGray (10
kGray is equivalent to 1 Mrad). The conveyor speed is adjusted
in order to achieve the desired dose. Typically, the conveyor
speed is from 0.5 to 20 metres/minute, preferably from 1 to 10
metres/minute, more preferably from 2.25 to 8.5 metres/minute.</p><p num="0019">As a result of the high irradiating potential of the
electron beam, not only can the conveyor speed be significantly
higher than in the prior art, but also the thickness of the
continuously moving bed of polypropylene/grafting agent mixture
on the conveyor can be relatively high. Typically, the bed of
polypropylene homopolymer and grafting agent has a thickness of
up to 20 cm, most particularly from 5 to 10 cm. The bed of
polypropylene homopolymer/grafting agent mixture on the conveyor
typically has a width of up to about 1 metre. The irradiation
is carried out under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen.</p><p num="0020">After irradiation by the electron beam, the polypropylene
powder can be annealed and then treated with at least one known
antioxidant additive. The annealing temperature may range from 
50 to 150°, more preferably from 80 to 120°C and the annealing
time may range from 1 to 60 minutes, more preferably from 5 to
30 minutes. Thereafter the polypropylene is granulated.</p><p num="0021">In accordance with the invention, the irradiated
polypropylene has increased recovery compliance, relaxation time
and melt strength. These particular rheological properties
provide an outstanding processing behaviour which allows the
polypropylene based polymers produced in accordance with the
invention to be suitable particularly for producing films,
sheets, fibres, pipes, foams, hollow articles, panels and
coatings. The irradiated polypropylene also has improved
mechanical properties, such as flexural modulus and impact
resistance.</p><p num="0022">The invention will now be described in greater detail with
reference to the following non-limiting example and the
accompanying drawing, in which:-

   Figure 1 is a graph showing the relationship between melt
strength and temperature for high melt strength polypropylene
produced in accordance with an embodiment of the process of the
invention and two other polypropylenes not produced in accordance
with the invention.</p><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLE</u></heading><p num="0023">In accordance with the example, a polypropylene homopolymer
fluff in the form of a powder having a median particle size (d<sub>50</sub>)
of from 1000 to 1500 microns, a bulk density of around 0.5g/cc
and having a melt flow index (MFI) of 1.0 g/10min was treated by
irradiation. In this specification the melt flow index (MFI) is
measured by the procedure of ASTM D 1238 using a load of 2.16kg
at a temperature of 230°C. The polypropylene powder had been
treated under pure nitrogen since the presence of oxygen is
detrimental to the irradiation process.</p><p num="0024">The polypropylene powder was then mixed with a grafting
agent comprising tetravinyl silane in an amount of 0.5wt% based
on the weight of the polypropylene powder. Thereafter, the
mixture of the polypropylene powder and the grafting agent was 
subjected to electron beam irradiation.</p><p num="0025">In particular, the polypropylene powder and grafting agent
mixture was deposited onto an endless belt conveyor having a
speed of 8.5 metres per minute. The polypropylene
powder/grafting agent mixture was deposited onto the conveyor as
a 1 metre wide bed having a thickness of 7 cm. The conveyor
conveyed the bed underneath a high energy high power electron
accelerator. Such accelerators are available in commerce. The
accelerator had an energy of 10 MeV and a power of 120 kW. The
polypropylene powder/grafting agent mixture was irradiated for
a period of time (determined by the conveyor speed) sufficient
to provide a radiation dose of 15 kGray. During the irradiation,
the powder was maintained under nitrogen to exclude oxygen.</p><p num="0026">After irradiation, the powder was mixed with conventional
antioxidant additives. Thereafter, the powder was granulated
under nitrogen gas.</p><p num="0027">In order to demonstrate the benefits of the present
invention, a number of samples were tested to determine their
properties, with one of the samples being processed in accordance
with the method of the present invention, and the remaining
samples not being processed in accordance with the method of the
present invention. Thus referring to Table 1, seven samples,
with their respective treatments, are indicated.</p><p num="0028">Sample 3 corresponds to the above-described Example in which
the specified polypropylene resin was irradiated by the electron
beam at the dose and conveyor speed specified in Table 1, with
the polypropylene having being mixed with tetravinyl silane
grafting agent prior to irradiation.</p><p num="0029">The remaining samples 1, 2 and 4 to 7 are not in accordance
with the invention but are included so as to show comparatively
the benefits of the invention exemplified by sample 3. </p><p num="0030">Sample 1 corresponds to the same polypropylene as employed
for sample 3, but which was not irradiated; in other words it was
the original polypropylene material.</p><p num="0031">Sample 2 corresponds to the same polypropylene material
which was subjected to irradiation under the dose and conveyor
speed specified in Table 1, with the polypropylene not having
been mixed with a grafting agent prior to irradiation.</p><p num="0032">Sample 4 corresponds to the same polypropylene which was
subjected to the same irradiation treatment as sample 2, but then
the polypropylene was annealed after the irradiation step to
facilitate recombination of any remaining radicals. The
annealing temperature was 120° and the annealing time was 30
minutes.</p><p num="0033">For each of samples 2 and 4, it may be seen that the dose
of irradiation is significantly higher than that for sample 3 in
accordance with the invention, and that the conveyor speed is
significant lower than that for sample 3 of the invention. This
is because in the absence of a grafting agent, in order to
achieve a reasonable level of branching following irradiation,
not only must the dose be very high but also the conveyor speed
must be considerably lower in order to increase the irradiation
time to ensure that a reasonable level of branching is achieved.
This significantly reduces the production rate of the irradiated
polypropylene. The higher dose required for samples 2 and 4
increases the production costs.</p><p num="0034">In Table 1, samples 5, 6 and 7 correspond to three
respective commercially available polypropylene resins with melt
flow index of around 3g/10 min. Profax PF 184 is available in
commerce from the company Montell North America, Inc. of
Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America and comprises a
polypropylene homopolymer which has been irradiated by a low
density electron beam at a high irradiation dose. The product
Daploy 130 D is a polypropylene resin available in commerce from 
the company PCD Polymere GmbH of Schwechat-Mannsworth, Austria.
The product FINAPRO PPH 4060 is a polypropylene resin available
in commerce from the company Fina Chemicals of Belgium. Samples
5 and 6 are high melt strength polypropylene resins with long
chain branching and sample 7 is a linear polypropylene
homopolymer.</p><p num="0035">Referring to Table 2, the melt flow index (MFI) of each of
the seven samples was measured. It will be seen that sample 3,
corresponding to the polypropylene produced in accordance with
the method of the present invention, had the lowest melt flow
index of 0.86 g/10min. This demonstrates that the use of
grafting agent promotes the recombination of macroradicals and
reduces the incidence of chain scission when compared to samples
2 and 4.</p><p num="0036">The MFI of sample 1 was increased by irradiation to form
sample 2 as a result of chain scission caused by the radiation.</p><p num="0037">When a grafting agent is not used, the competition between
chain scission and recombination is in favour of chain scission,
as exemplified by the increase of MFI of samples 2 and 4 as
compared to Example 1. When a grafting agent is used in
accordance with the invention, then the chain scission is
overcompensated by the recombination to lead to a lower MFI
value, which may be seen by a small decrease in the MFI value
going from sample 1 to sample 3 produced in accordance with the
invention.</p><p num="0038">For samples 1 to 6 the mechanical properties of extrusion
force at 250°C, melt strength at 250°C, 270°C and 290°C and speed
at break 250°C, 270°C and 290°C were measured and the results are
shown in Table 3. The melt strength is the force, measured in
milliNewtons (mN) that is required to draw a polymer in the
molten state. In this specification, the melt strength has been
measured using a rheological device for capillary and tensile
rheometry on polymer melts, such as a CEAST 1000 rheometer. In 
this specification, the polymer is melted and extruded through
a capillary die. The extrusion force, or the force which is
applied to the melt to be extruded through the capillary die at
a constant flow rate, is measured in newtons (N). The filament
is drawn by stretching or elongation as a result of being
attached to a roll which is rotating with a constant acceleration
of 10 rpm per 100 seconds, with an initial rotational speed of
2 rpm. The force required to draw the filament is recorded
continuously and is expressed in milliNewtons (mN). The force
increases with an increase in the rotational speed of the roll
until the force reaches a plateau, which is recorded as the final
value of the melt strength. It is this final value which is
specified in Table 3. Additionally, the rotational speed at
which the filament breaks is also determined and is expressed as
an instantaneous rotational speed in rpm and corresponds to the
speed at break specified in Table 3. It may be seen that for
sample 3 produced in accordance with the invention, this shows
a high level of melt strength, particularly over a range of
processing temperatures and rather a low speed at break. Samples
5 and 6 lose their melt strength at 290°C and are spinnable as
a standard product. At 290°C sample 3 has a good level of melt
strength. In contrast, samples 2 and 4 show a limited increase
of melt strength.</p><p num="0039">Figure 1 shows for samples 3, 5 and 6 the relationship
between melt strength and temperature. It may be seen that for
sample 3, as compared to samples 5 and 6, the rate of decrease
of melt strength of temperature is significantly reduced.
Moreover, it may also be seen that the polypropylene of sample
3 still has a high melt strength at 290°C, while the
polypropylenes of samples 5 and 6 have no significant melt
strength at that temperature. Thus the process of the present
invention enables the production of high melt strength
polypropylenes which have good melt strength at high
temperatures, enabling them to be processed, for example to
produce spun fibres, at high processing temperatures. </p><p num="0040">It may be thus seen in accordance with the invention that
the use of the process of the invention can provide a
polypropylene having a high melt strength which is a strong
advantage when the molten polymer is being processed, for example
when being blown into film, extruded into pipes, spun into
fibres, or formed as a foam.</p><p num="0041">Referring to Table 4, this shows the values of the flexural
modulus and the impact resistance for sample 3 produced in
accordance with the invention, and for samples 1, 5, 6 and 7.
The flexural modulus was measured using the procedure of ISO 178
and the impact resistance was measured using the IZOD test at
23°C of the procedure of ISO R180/1A. Comparing the
polypropylene of sample 3 with that of sample 1, it may be seen
that the use of high energy electron beam irradiation in
combination with the grafting agent for forming long chain
branches on the polypropylene molecules increases both the
flexural modulus and the impact resistance of the polypropylene,
while keeping substantially the same melt flow index. The
mechanical properties of the polypropylene are improved, while
maintaining substantially the same melt flow properties of the
polypropylene. Comparing the polypropylene of sample 3 produced
in accordance with the invention with those of samples 5, 6 and
7 which are commercially available polypropylenes, it may be seen
that the flexural modulus of the polypropylene produced in
accordance with the invention is either the same as or
significantly greater than the flexural modulus of those known
commercial polypropylenes, and also compared to all three samples
5, 6 and 7 sample 3 has a significantly higher impact resistance,
for example at least about 50% higher than for the known
polypropylene. Thus the process of the present invention enables
a polypropylene having improved mechanical properties, as well
as increased melt strength, to be achieved.</p><p num="0042">The recovery compliance and relaxation time were measured
for samples 1 to 7 and the results are shown in Table 5. In
accordance with the invention the recovery compliance and 
relaxation times of sample 3 are higher than that for samples 2
and 4 where no grafting agent was employed. Moreover, for sample
3 produced in accordance with the invention, the relaxation time
was significantly higher than that for all the other samples.
These results clearly show the advantage of adding a grafting
agent prior to the irradiation step. <tables><table><tgroup cols="4"><tbody><row><entry align="left">Sample</entry><entry align="left">Treatment</entry><entry align="left">Dose (kGray)</entry><entry
