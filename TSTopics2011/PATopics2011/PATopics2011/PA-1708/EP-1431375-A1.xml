from a lubricant source into a fuel combustion system or to the exhaust therefrom. By the
present invention, molybdenum from the lubricant will interact with phosphorus, sulfur, and/or
lead from the combustion products. Molybdenum can also enter the combustion system in the
present invention as a component of the fuel being burned. In this invention, the molybdenum
scavenges or inactivates harmful materials which have migrated into the fuel or combustion
products, and which can otherwise poison catalytic converters, sensors and/or automotive on-board
diagnostic devices. The invention thus provides a method for improving combustion
efficiency of a fuel being combusted in a combustion unit through the introduction therein of
molybdenum. The present invention can also lead to improved durability of exhaust after
treatment systems.</p><heading><b><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0002">A problem exists in fuel combustion systems in which the fuel contains, or acquires, or
produces upon combustion, one or more metal (e.g. lead), sulfur, and/or phosphorus
contaminants that can poison or degrade catalytic converters, sensors, or on-board diagnostic
devices.</p><p num="0003">An additional problem is created by such contaminants in the form of undesirably
increased levels of certain combustion products or by-products in the exhaust.</p><p num="0004">Yet another problem from such contaminants is a detrimental effect on after treatment
systems. These contaminants can include elemental phosphorus, lead and sulfur, or compounds 
thereof in the fuel, or in the air. The contaminants can also get into the fuel, or the combustion
chamber, or the combustion exhaust stream from the engine lubricants which often contain
phosphorus-containing and sulfur-containing additives, and lead compounds associated with
combustion system wear. In addition, the combustion in a waste incinerator of waste engine oil
will often have oil containing a molybdenum lubricity or antioxidant additive.</p><p num="0005">It is a well-known phenomenon that vehicles and other combustion systems consume,
that is the engine bums, oil used as a lubricant for the engine or moving parts of a combustion
system. Various pathways exist for lubricating oil to enter the combustion system, and/or its
exhaust stream. Clearly the various components or additives in the lubricating oil also are
consumed or burned and these components or additives can have deleterious effects on the
combustion system's catalysts, after treatment system, and emissions.</p><p num="0006">It is therefore desirable to inhibit, reduce or prevent the deleterious interaction of
components (such as phosphorus, lead and/or sulfur arising from the lubricant source, air or fuel
or otherwise entering the combustion process) with the combustion exhaust stream to thereby
prevent catalyst poisoning, after treatment system malfunction, and increased emissions.</p><heading><b><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0007">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method to inhibit, reduce or prevent
the deleterious interaction of components (such as phosphorus, lead and/or sulfur arising from
the lubricant source, any processing aid or adjuvant, fuel, fuel additive, air or otherwise entering
the combustion process) with the combustion exhaust stream of a combustion unit by the
introduction to the unit or its exhaust stream of an effective amount of molybdenum to thereby
prevent catalyst poisoning, sensor poisoning, after treatment system malfunction, and/or
increased emissions. </p><p num="0008">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a system for adding an effective
amount of molybdenum to the combustion of a fuel for scavenging phosphorus, lead and/or
sulfur from the fuel or the products resulting from the combustion of the fuel.</p><p num="0009">The present invention further relates to methods to improve the durability of an after
treatment device for a combustion system, wherein the method includes contacting the products
of the combustion of a hydrocarbonaceous fuel with a lubricant containing molybdenum in an
amount sufficient for the molybdenum to interact with one or more contaminants selected from
the group consisting of phosphorus, sulfur, lead or compounds thereof in said products to thereby
reduce the amount of one or more of the contaminants contacting the after treatment device.</p><p num="0010">By "molybdenum" herein is meant any molybdenum compound, source or material,
including but not limited to molybdenum trioxide, mono-nuclear and di-nuclear and tri-nuclear
molybdenum sulfonate, molybdenum phenate, molybdenum salicylate, molybdenum
carboxylates, molybdenum dithiocarbamates, neutral and overbased molybdenum salicylates,
neutral and overbased molybdenum phenates, neutral and overbased molybdenum sulfonates,
ammonium molybdate, sodium molybdate, potassium molybdate, and molybdenum halides,
compounds derived from molybdenum reacted with amines and alcohols, and combinations and
mixtures thereof. Examples of commercial sulfur-containing oil soluble molybdenum
compounds are Sakura-Lube 100, Sakura-Lube 155, Sakura-Lube 165, and Sakura-Lube 180
from Asahi Denka Kogyo K.K., Molyvan® A, Molyvan® 807 and Molyvan® 822 from R. T.
Vanderbilt Company, and Naugalube MolyFM from Crompton Corporation. Examples of
commercial sulfur- and phosphorus-free oil soluble molybdenum compounds are Sakura-Lube
700 from Asahi Denka Kogyo K.K., and Molyvan® 856B and Molyvan® 855 from R. T.
Vanderbilt Company, Inc. </p><p num="0011">The molybdenum is preferably present in the lubricant as an oil-soluble additive that can
volatilize and thereby enter the combustion chamber or exhaust stream. It may also enter the
combustion chamber through "bulk" consumption, i.e., past valve guides or around piston rings.</p><p num="0012">By "base oil" herein is meant a base oil which can be selected from the group consisting of
paraffinic, naphthenic, aromatic, poly-alpha-olefins, synthetic esters, and polyol esters, and
mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the base oil contains less than or equal to 0.03 wt.
% sulfur, and greater than or equal to 90 wt. % saturates, and has a viscosity index greater than
or equal to 80 and less than or equal to 120. In another embodiment, the base oil contains less
than or equal to 0.03 wt. % sulfur, and greater than or equal to 90 wt. % saturates, and has a
viscosity index greater than or equal to 120. In a more preferred embodiment, the base oil is
substantially sulfur-free.</p><p num="0013">By "scavenging" herein is meant the contacting, combining with, reacting, incorporating,
chemically bonding with or to, physically bonding with or to, adhering to, agglomerating with,
affixing, inactivating, rendering inert, consuming, alloying, gathering, cleansing, consuming, or
any other way or means whereby a first material makes a second material unavailable or less
available.</p><p num="0014">By "interaction", "interacting" and "interacts" herein is meant scavenging.</p><p num="0015">By "inactivating" herein is meant scavenging.</p><p num="0016">By "hydrocarbonaceous fuel" herein is meant hydrocarbonaceous fuels such as but not
limited to diesel fuel, jet fuel, alcohols, ethers, kerosene, low sulfur fuels, synthetic fuels, such as
Fischer-Tropsch fuels, liquid petroleum gas, fuels derived from coal, genetically engineered
biofuels and crops and extracts therefrom, natural gas, propane, butane, unleaded motor and
aviation gasolines, and so-called reformulated gasolines which typically contain both 
hydrocarbons of the gasoline boiling range and fuel-soluble oxygenated blending agents, such as
alcohols, ethers and other suitable oxygen-containing organic compounds. Oxygenates suitable
for use in the fuels of the present invention include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, <i>t</i>-butanol,
mixed alcohols, methyl tertiary butyl ether, tertiary amyl methyl ether, ethyl tertiary butyl ether
and mixed ethers. Oxygenates, when used, will normally be present in the reformulated
gasoline fuel in an amount below about 25% by volume, and preferably in an amount that
provides an oxygen content in the overall fuel in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 percent by
volume. "Hydrocarbonaceous fuel" or "fuel" herein shall also mean waste or used engine or
motor oils which may or may not contain molybdenum, gasoline, bunker fuel, coal (dust or
slurry), crude oil, refinery "bottoms" and by-products, crude oil extracts, hazardous wastes, yard
trimmings and waste, wood chips and saw dust, agricultural waste, fodder, silage, plastics and
other organic waste and/or by-products, and mixtures thereof, and emulsions, suspensions, and
dispersions thereof in water, alcohol, or other carrier fluids. By "diesel fuel" herein is meant
one or more fuels selected from the group consisting of diesel fuel, biodiesel, biodiesel-derived
fuel, synthetic diesel and mixtures thereof. It is preferred that the hydrocarbonaceous fuel is
substantially sulfur-free, by which is meant a sulfur content not to exceed on average about 30 ppm
of the fuel. Since the fuel useful in the present invention may include used or waste oil having a
molybdenum friction modifier or lubricity additive, the molybdenum in the scavenging and
protection achieved by the present invention can also come from such a fuel instead of, or in
addition to, the lubricant.</p><p num="0017">By "combustion system" and "apparatus" herein is meant, for example and not by
limitation herein, any diesel-electric hybrid vehicle, a gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle, a two-stroke
engine, any and all burners or combustion units, including for example and without 
limitation herein, stationary burners, waste incinerators, diesel fuel burners, diesel fuel engines,
automotive diesel engines, gasoline fuel burners, gasoline fuel engines, power plant generators,
and the like. The hydrocarbonaceous fuel combustion systems that may benefit from the present
invention include all combustion units, systems, devices, and/or engines that burn fuels. By
"combustion system" herein is also meant any and all internal and external combustion devices,
machines, engines, turbine engines, jet engines, boilers, incinerators, evaporative burners, plasma
burner systems, plasma arc, stationary burners, and the like which can combust or in which can
be combusted a hydrocarbonaceous fuel.</p><p num="0018">By "contacting" herein is meant the contacting, bringing together, reacting, complexing,
coordinating, combining, admixing, mixing, and the like association between two or more
materials, whether or not a chemical or physical reaction or change occurs.</p><p num="0019">By "essentially free of phosphorus and compounds thereof" is meant an amount of
elemental phosphorus or a compound thereof which is less than about 10 ppm in the lubricant or
resulting exhaust stream. Such low levels of phosphorus are desirable in many current lubricant
formulations, and it is anticipated that lower levels of phosphorus in lubricants will be
continually sought, perhaps required. A preferred level of phosphorus in the lubricant is an
amount between 1 ppm and approximately 1500 ppm. A more preferred level of phosphorus in
the lubricant is an amount between 500 ppm and 1200 ppm.</p><p num="0020">By "after treatment system" or "after treatment device" herein is meant any system or
device which contacts the combustion product(s) from a combustion chamber in a manner
designed to oxidize, reduce or otherwise treat the combustion product(s). Examples, but not by
way of limitations herein, of such after treatment systems include an automobile three-way
catalytic converter, lean NO<sub>x</sub> traps, catalyzed diesel particulate filter ("C-DPF") and a 
continuously regenerating technology diesel particulate filter. "After treatment system" also
includes associated sensors like O<sub>2</sub> sensors and NO<sub>x</sub> sensors. Analogous gasoline combustion
after treatment systems are known and are included herein as deriving benefit from the present
invention.</p><p num="0021">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following
detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further
explanation of the present invention, as claimed.</p><heading><b><u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</u></b></heading><p num="0022">In a more specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method for reducing the
amount of, or the deleterious effect on exhaust emissions after treatment and control devices
from, at least one contaminant selected from the group consisting of phosphorus, lead, sulfur,
and compounds thereof in an exhaust stream from the combustion of a hydrocarbonaceous fuel
in a combustion system lubricated by a lubricant, said method including the steps: (a) lubricating
the combustion system with the lubricant comprising a major amount of a base oil of lubricating
viscosity and a minor amount of one or more additives comprising (i) at least one organosulfur
compound, or at least one organophosphorus compound, or both, and (ii) at least one
molybdenum source; (b) combusting in the combustion system the hydrocarbonaceous fuel to
produce combustion products comprising at least one contaminant material selected from the
group consisting of sulfur, lead, phosphorus, and compounds thereof; and (c) contacting the
molybdenum with the sulfur, lead, phosphorus, and compounds thereof in the combustion
products, whereby the molybdenum interacts with the sulfur, lead, phosphorus, and/or
compounds thereof. This interaction between the molybdenum and the sulfur, lead, phosphorus, 
and/or compounds thereof results in the scavenging of the contaminants, whereby several
beneficial results are obtained. By scavenging at least one and preferably more or all of the
contaminants, the beneficial results include maintaining catalytic converter performance,
maintaining sensor performance, maintaining LNT performance, and maintaining diesel
particulate filter (DPF) performance.</p><p num="0023">The present invention also provides a method of improving the combustion of a fuel in a
combustion system for improving DPF performance, as determined by reduced thermal
gravimetric analysis soot light-off temperature, said method comprising introducing a
combustion improving amount of molybdenum to the combustion in a combustion system of a
fuel, whereby the thermal gravimetric analysis light-off temperature is reduced relative to the
thermal gravimetric analysis light-off temperature achieved in the absence of the introduction of
molybdenum.</p><p num="0024">When cars are operated with molybdenum in the lubricant, less phosphorus, sulfur, and
lead will be deposited on the car's catalytic converter. According to the present invention, less
phosphorus, sulfur and lead is deposited throughout the catalyst when Mo has been combusted in
or with the fuel. Molybdenum is combining in the combustion or exhaust stream with
phosphorus and/or sulfur to form stable molybdenum-phosphorus and/or molybdenum sulfate
species that do not form impermeable or reduced-permeability glazes on the catalyst. With less
impermeable glaze on the catalyst, less emissions can "break through", i.e., pass through as
unconverted emissions. Therefore, it is desirable to have Mo in the combustion and/or exhaust
stream.</p><p num="0025">Thus, the present invention provides a method to inhibit the formation of a phosphorus-containing,
sulfur-containing, or lead-containing permeability-reducing glaze on the surface of a 
catalyst exposed to the products from the combustion in a combustion unit of a fuel, wherein the
method includes contacting molybdenum with the products of combustion of the fuel, wherein
the products contain at least one member selected from the group consisting of phosphorus-containing,
sulfur-containing and lead-containing materials. The sulfur-containing materials can
poison the active metals of the catalyst whether or not a sulfur-containing glaze is formed on the
surface of the catalyst.</p><p num="0026">Further evidence of phosphorus, sulfur and lead protection and lower emissions achieved
by the presence of molybdenum in the combustion product of a lubricant or fuel containing
molybdenum can be drawn from the literature that teaches that molybdenum can be used to
protect platinum catalysts from sulfur poisoning in refinery naphtha reforming reactions, and
also in hydrodesulfurization reactions for lowering sulfur in gasoline and diesel fuels. (B.
Delmon, "Recent Approaches to the Anatomy and Physiology of Cobalt Molybdenum
Hydrodesulfurization Catalysts," Proceedings of the Climax Third International Conference on
the Chemistry and Uses of Molybdenum, Ann Arbor, Mich., Aug. 19-23, 1979, p. 73-84.</p><p num="0027">As an additional benefit, molybdenum in the exhaust after treatment system can be
expected to scavenge lead to form the white colored, well-known normal molybdate "PbMoO<sub>4</sub>"
(melting point 1065 °C), also known as wulfenite (Cotton, F. A., and Wilkinson, G.; "Advanced
Inorganic Chemistry, Fifth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p. 805). and prevent lead
poisoning of the exhaust emissions after treatment equipment.</p><p num="0028">The most important ore of molybdenum is molybdenite (MoS<sub>2</sub>). By virtue of the "natural
stability" of MoS<sub>2</sub>, this material would be the most likely species forming as a result of the
molybdenum-sulfur interaction spelled out in this invention. Molybdenum oxides, when heated
in the presence of a sulfur source, give MoS<sub>2</sub>, which is the most stable molybdenum sulfide at 
high temperature. According to Cotton, this sulfide has a crystal lattice of close-packed layers
of sulfur atoms creating trigonal prismatic interstices occupied by molybdenum atoms.
Therefore, by scavenging sulfur, the resulting product, MoS<sub>2</sub>, is protecting the exhaust after
treatment system from catalyst poisons.</p><p num="0029">The present invention thus establishes that the molybdenum in the combustion stream
scavenges catalyst pollutants by tying them up as sulfides, phosphates, and lead molybdates.
These product compounds then participate further in emissions control as demonstrated in the
following example.</p><p num="0030">Example: Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) testing was used to determine the effect of
the fuel soluble metal additives on the temperature of maximum soot oxidation. Particulate
matter (PM) generated from a 1998 Cummins M-11 engine operated on the US EPA transient
emissions cycle was collected on a quartz fiber filter. The oil used was a heavy duty diesel oil
with ZDDP in the additive package. Elemental analysis of the oil gave the following results in
parts per million (ppm): Phosphorus (1264), sulfur (4000), zinc (1437), boron (407), calcium
(3614), and magnesium (18). The base fuel used was a number 2 diesel fuel with 388 ppm by
weight sulfur. From this fuel, three additional fuels were made by adding strontium, manganese,
and molybdenum at 20 mg metal per liter fuel, respectively. For each separate fuel, PM
generated during three consecutive EPA Heavy-Duty Transient cycles was collected on a single
filter using a Pierburg PS2000A particulate sampling system. TGA was then performed on
small sections of each PM loaded filter using a TA Instruments Model 2950. The sample
temperature was increased at a rate of 20°C/minute under air at ambient pressure for all runs.
From a plot of weight loss vs. time, the temperature at which the maximum soot oxidation rate
occurred was determined. The TGA results of the four sets of particulates are plotted in Figures 
1 &amp; 2. Figure 1 shows the metal additives in mg metal per liter of fuel while Figure 2 show the
same results calculated in gravimetric efficiency of the respective metals. Both Figures show
that after scavenging the sulfur and phosphorus coming from the fuel and oil used, the
molybdenum also lowered the light off temperature by 157°C from that of the base fuel (655 °C)
to that of the molybdenum containing system (498 °C). These results show that after scavenging
sulfur, phosphorus, and lead from the combustion/exhaust system, the resultant molybdenum
products are also active in carbon burnout chemistry and result in a further soot lowering as
shown in Figures 1 and 2. If the emissions control system contains a catalyst of any nature, for
example, a continuously regenerating diesel particulate filter (DPF), or a diesel oxidation
catalyst, and/or a lean NO<sub>x</sub> trap (LNT), then these emission control units would also be protected
from the sulfur, phosphorus, and lead poisoning and therefore retain their performance level so
long as the molybdenum scavenger is in the system. This significant molybdenum synergism
with the system catalysts in soot oxidation is an unexpected bonus to the scavenging benefit of
the molybdenum that would be added to the lubricant.</p><p num="0031">It should be understood that the contaminants being scavenged according to the present
invention by the molybdenum from the lubricant can originate from the air utilized in the
combustion of the hydrocarbonaceous fuel.</p><p num="0032">In another embodiment, the contaminants being scavenged according to the present
invention by the molybdenum can originate from the hydrocarbonaceous fuel.</p><p num="0033">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the contaminants being scavenged by
the molybdenum can originate from the lubricant used to lubricate the combustion system.</p><p num="0034">In one embodiment, the lubricant-borne molybdenum which will scavenge the
contaminant(s) can bleed, "blow-by", flow, seep, be forced or compressed, be drawn, sucked, or 
aspirated or otherwise accidentally or deliberately get into a combustion chamber of the
combustion system. In this embodiment, the contaminant(s) encounter and interact with the
molybdenum during or after the combustion process, whereby scavenging occurs. Thus an
embodiment of a method of the present invention is achieved when lubricant containing
molybdenum escapes around a valve in the combustion system, such as for example and not as a
limitation herein, an intake valve or an exhaust valve in an automotive engine. In this manner,
the molybdenum is caused to encounter and interact with the contaminant(s), whereby
scavenging can occur.</p><p num="0035">In another embodiment, the molybdenum is caused, deliberately or inadvertently, to
encounter the contaminant(s) in a passageway through which the combustion products
containing the contaminant(s) are conveyed away from the combustion chamber. In this
manner, the scavenging occurs outside the combustion chamber of the combustion system.</p><p num="0036">In another embodiment of the present invention, the molybdenum volatilizes from the
lubricant and is carried over into the combustion chamber containing the fuel.</p><p num="0037">In yet another embodiment, the combustion system utilizes a deliberate recirculating
process, whereby vapors in a crankcase are recirculated into either the intake manifold or the
combustion chamber. In this manner, any lubricant containing the phosphorus, sulfur, and/or
lead contaminants is caused to encounter and interact with molybdenum in the combustion or
exhaust.</p><p num="0038">In one embodiment, the fuel or the exhaust from its combustion is treated with a low level
of molybdenum, such as for example, a molybdenum level of about 20 ppm Mo in the fuel or
combustion exhaust or less. </p><p num="0039">This invention also achieved catalyst protection and contaminant scavenging when the
fuel combusted contains an oil having a molybdenum compound, without extra molybdenum
being delivered to the combustion unit or its exhaust from a lubricant source.</p><p num="0040">The present invention provides in another embodiment an apparatus for performing a
method for reducing the amount of, or deleterious effect on exhaust emissions after treatment
and control devices of, at least one contaminant selected from the group consisting of
phosphorus, lead, sulfur and compounds thereof in an exhaust stream, wherein the apparatus
contains (a) a combustion chamber adapted to combust a hydrocarbonaceous fuel; (b) a means to
introduce the hydrocarbonaceous fuel into the combustion chamber; (c) a means to convey
combustion product from the combustion chamber; (d) a lubricant comprising a major amount of
a base oil of lubricating viscosity and a minor amount of one or more additives comprising (i) at
least one organosulfur compound, or at least one organophosphorus compound, or both, and (ii)
at least one molybdenum source; and (e) a means to introduce the lubricant to the combustion
product. The apparatus can further contain an after treatment device or system.</p><p num="0041">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the organosulfur compound in the
lubricant can be selected from the group consisting of sulfurized olefins, sulfurized fats and
vegetable oils, sulfurized unsaturated esters and amides, ashless and metal containing
dithiocarbamates, substituted thiadiazoles, sulfurized hindered phenols, sulfurized alkylphenols,
neutral metal-containing sulfonate detergents, overbased metal-containing sulfonate detergents,
neutral metal-containing sulfurized phenate detergents, and overbased metal-containing
sulfurized phenate detergents, or combinations and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0042">According to another embodiment, the organophosphorus compound in the lubricant can
be selected from the group consisting of primary, secondary and aryl neutral and overbased zinc 
dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDP's), trialkyl- and triarylphosphites, mixed alkyl/aryl phosphites,
alkyl and aryl phosphorothiolthionates, and alkyl and aryl phosphorothionates, and combinations
or mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0043">It is therefore believed that by the use of the present invention a significant reduction in
the amount of phosphorus detected on a device such as a catalyst can be achieved when
molybdenum is in the exhaust stream from a combustion system. Specifically, reductions in the
amount of such contaminants above 20% by weight, and more preferably reductions in an
amount of from 60% to 80% by weight detected on the after treatment device will be achieved
by the present invention. This will produces a dramatic and highly desirable benefit in the
improved durability of such after treatment devices or systems.</p><p num="0044">Other embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art
from consideration of the specification, Figures and practice of the invention disclosed herein.
It is intended that the specification and Figures be considered as exemplary only, with a true
