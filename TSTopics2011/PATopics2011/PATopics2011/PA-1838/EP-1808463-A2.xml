At the jet operating temperature, droplets of liquid ink are ejected from the printing device and, when the ink droplets contact the surface of the recording substrate, either directly or via an intermediate heated transfer belt or drum, they quickly solidify to form a predetermined pattern of solidified ink drops. Phase change inks have also been used in other printing technologies, such as gravure printing, as disclosed in, for example, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5496879A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 5,496,879</text></patcit> and German Patent Publications <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE4205636" status="new"><text>DE 4205636</text></patcit>AL and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE4205713" status="new"><text>DE 4205713</text></patcit>AL, the disclosures of each of which are totally incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="p0003">Phase change inks for color printing typically comprise a phase change ink carrier composition which is combined with a phase change ink compatible colorant. In a specific embodiment, a series of colored phase change inks can be formed by combining ink carrier compositions with compatible subtractive primary colorants. The subtractive primary colored phase change inks can comprise four component dyes, namely, cyan, magenta, yellow and black, although the inks are not limited to these four colors. These subtractive primary colored inks can be formed by using a single dye or a mixture of dyes. For example, magenta can be obtained by using a mixture of Solvent Red Dyes or a composite black can be obtained by mixing several dyes. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US4889560A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 4,889,560</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US4889761A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 4,889,761</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5372852A" status="new"><text>U.S.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Patent 5,372,852</text></patcit>, the disclosures of each of which are totally incorporated herein by reference, teach that the subtractive primary colorants employed can comprise dyes from the classes of Color Index (C.I.) Solvent Dyes, Disperse Dyes, modified Acid and Direct Dyes, and Basic Dyes. <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5621022A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent 5,621,022</text></patcit>, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses the use of a specific class of polymeric dyes in phase change ink compositions.</p><p num="p0004">Phase change inks have also been used for applications such as postal marking, industrial marking, and labelling.</p><p num="p0005">Phase change inks are desirable for ink jet printers because they remain in a solid phase at room temperature during shipping, long term storage, and the like. In addition, the problems associated with nozzle clogging as a result of ink evaporation with liquid ink jet inks are largely eliminated, thereby improving the reliability of the ink jet printing. Further, in phase change ink jet printers wherein the ink droplets are applied directly onto the final recording substrate (for example, paper, transparency material, and the like), the droplets solidify immediately upon contact with the substrate, so that migration of ink along the printing medium is prevented and dot quality is improved.</p><p num="p0006">Compositions suitable for use as phase change ink carrier compositions are known.

To evaluate the dye solubility in the ink base, spectral strengths at 580 nm of the inks were used as the measurement of dye solubility in the filtered and unfiltered inks. Any undissolved dye in the ink was filtered out, resulting in the smaller spectral strength of the filtered ink compared to that of the unfiltered ink. Accordingly, the ratio of the filtered ink's spectral strength to the unfiltered ink's spectral strength ("SS ratio") is a measure of dye solubility; to the degree that the SS ratio is significantly less than 1, it indicates poor solubility of the dye in the ink base. Glass transition temperature (Tg) was measured by Dynamic Mechanic Analysis using a Rheometrics Solid Analyzer (RSA II). Melting point and freezing point were measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) using a DUPONT 2100 calorimeter.<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --><tables id="tabl0002" num="0002"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="5"><colspec colwidth="59mm" colnum="1" colname="col1"/><colspec colwidth="19mm" colnum="2" colname="col2"/><colspec colwidth="19mm" colnum="3" colname="col3"/><colspec colwidth="13mm" colnum="4" colname="col4"/><colspec colwidth="12mm" colnum="5" colname="col5"/><thead><row><entry align="center" valign="top">Ink</entry><entry align="center" valign="top">A</entry><entry align="center" valign="top">B</entry><entry align="center" valign="top">C</entry><entry align="center" valign="top">1</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">unfiltered spectral strength at 380 nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1014</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">812</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1030</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">884</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">unfiltered spectral strength at 480 nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">973</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">827</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">959</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">808</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">unfiltered spectral strength at 580 nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1142</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">886</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1115</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">928</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">filtered spectral strength at 380 nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">993</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">796</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1028</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">543</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">filtered spectral strength at 480 nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">841</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">724</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">957</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">490</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">filtered spectral strength at 580 nm</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1129</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">883</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1111</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">545</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">SS ratio (filtered/unfiltered at 580 nm)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">0.99</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1.00</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1.00</entry><entry char="." align="char" charoff="20" valign="middle">0.69</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">viscosity at 110째C (centipoise) (filtered)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">10.45</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">10.83</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">---</entry><entry char="." align="char" charoff="20" valign="middle">9.59</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">viscosity at 140째C (centipoise) (filtered)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">---</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">---</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">10.86</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">---</entry></row><row><entry align="center">T<sub>g</sub></entry><entry align="center">9.63</entry><entry align="center">11.8</entry><entry align="center">---</entry><entry align="center">---</entry></row><row><entry align="center">melting point (째C)</entry><entry align="center">80.2</entry><entry align="center">80.2</entry><entry align="center">---</entry><entry align="center">---</entry></row><row><entry align="center">freezing point (째C)</entry><entry align="center">67.2, 72.4</entry><entry align="center">68.7, 74.5</entry><entry align="center">---</entry><entry align="center">---</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables>
Inks A and B were incorporated into a XEROX짰 PHASER짰 8400 modified to print at 110째C and printed successfully. Ink C was incorporated into a XEROX짰 PHASER짰 8400 printing at the standard printing temperature and was printed successfully. As the data indicate, the colorant prepared in Example I<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> dissolved well in the inks.
