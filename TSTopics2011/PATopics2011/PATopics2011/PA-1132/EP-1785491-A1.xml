Hybridization is based upon pairing between complementary nucleic acid strands. Single-stranded oligonucleotides having known sequences can be used as hybridization probes to identify target sequences of nucleic acid analytes, by exposing the probes to sample solutions containing a nucleic acid analyte of interest. If a nucleic acid analyte hybridizes to a probe, the analyte necessarily contains the target sequence. Various aspects of this method have been studied in detail. In essence, all variations allow complementary base sequences to pair and form double-stranded molecules, and a number of methods are known in the art to determine whether pairing has occurred, such as those described in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5622822A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,622,822 to Ekeze et al.</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5256535A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,256,535 to Ylikoski et al.</text></patcit></p><p num="p0003">Another method of detecting the binding of a probe to a target sequence is described by <nplcit id="ncit0001" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Whitcombe et al. (1999), "Detection of PCR products using self-probing amplicons and fluorescence," Nature Biotechnology 17:804-807</text></nplcit>. The method involves use of a probe containing a nucleotide sequence that is not amplified during the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), wherein the probe is designed to form a hairpin structure in which a fluorophore and a quencher are in setf-quenching proximity. Upon denaturation and hybridization with a target nucleotide sequence, however, the segment of the probe that was formerly in the hairpin structure hybridizes with the amplified target sequence, and is detectable by the increased fluorescence. This "Scorpion" probe combines the functions of a PCR primer and a detection probe and provides enhanced amplification and detection, in part due to the unimolecular nature of the binding reaction of the fluorescent probe to the target nucleotide sequence, which increases the rate and extent of the reaction. This technology is also described in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5525494A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,525,494</text></patcit> to Newton.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> Detection of genetic variation among individuals is another application of sequence-specific hybridization technologies. Detection and analysis of allelic variations or SNPs in DNA typically involves chain extension and amplification using primers targeted for a specific sequence. The amplified DNA is then used as a target for various labeled oligonucleotide probes to identify point mutations and allelic sequence variation. If, however, the target DNA forms intra-molecular secondary structures, the DNA may not be able to hybridize with the primer or labeling probes effciently or at all, thus resulting in no signal for the presence or absence of an SNP at the location of the secondary structure.</p><p num="p0004">Such intramolecular secondary structures in a single-stranded nucleic acid, such as rRNA or denatured DNA, arise from the intramolecular formation of hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotide sequences within the single-stranded nucleic acid itself. This residual secondary structure can sterically inhibit, or even block, hybrid formation between an oligonucleotide, for example a DNA or RNA oligomer being used as a probe, and its complementary sequence in the RNA or DNA (e.g., ribosomal RNA, mRNA, or DNA) that the probe targets.</p><p num="p0005">There are numerous cases in which there is difficulty in determining the presence or absence of SNPs in a particular target nucleic acid. For example, cytochrome P450 exists in several allelic variations, which are associated with altered metabolism of drugs and/or cancer susceptibility. One variant of cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, has an SNP in each of the four exons of the P450 GYP2D6 gene. In experiments performed to test for the presence of these SNPs, difficulties have been encountered in detecting SNPs in exons 1 and 2, due to significant secondary structure in the regions of analytical intarst in these exons. Although exons 1 and 2 can be amplified with conventional primer sets, the product cannot be detected in the SNP assay. Problems in probing exons 1 and 2 were eventually linked to intra-molecular secondary structure in these two amplicons. This secondary structure precludes hybridization of allele-specific discrimination probes that would be used in an assay for these SNPs. The structures of these exons are shown in FIG. 1, where it can be seen that exons 6 and 9 exhibit relatively little difficulty for PCR and hybridization with discrimination probes, whereas exons 1 and 2 show significant secondary structure in the region of the SNP. The analysis region and the SNP are shown in red in FIG. 1.</p><p num="p0006">One solution to this problem of enhancing hybridization of a probe to a target nucleotide sequence when the target sequence forms intramolecular secondary structures has been proposed in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5030557A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,030,557 to Hogan et al</text></patcit>. In this patent, Hogan et al. describe how the addition of a helper nucleic acid sequence in molar excess (at least about 5 times that of the probe and up to 100 or more times that of the probe) to the nucleic acid probe sequence aids in hybridization of the probe sequence to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> target sequence. In fact, Hogan et al. demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using molar ratios of helper oligonucleotide to probe oligonucleotide of 60:1, 100:1 and 250:1. In addition, Hogan et al, state that the helper oligonucleotides should be longer than about 20 to about 50 nucleotides in length in order to be effective in blocking the formation of tbe secondary structure.</p><p num="p0007">Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide improved hybridization probes and methods of detecting sequences contained within regions of a target molecule that tend to form an unwanted secondary structure. The method described by Hogan et al. provides one such solution. This method, however, has the disadvantages of requiring a large excess of helper oligonucleotide over probe oligonucleotide, and of constraining the length of the helper oligonucleotides.</p><heading><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="p0008">The present invention addresses the aforementioned need in the art, and in a first embodiment provides a primer that includes both a primer sequence effective to amplify a target nucleotide sequence in a target molecule, and a blocking sequence that disrupts secondary structure formation in a single-stranded form of the target molecule, or in an amplicon formed during an amplification assay (accordingly, the primer is sometimes referred to herein as a "dual-purpose" primer). A primer having these combined features is useful in a method for detecting the presence or absence of a site of interest (e.g., an SNP) contained within or proximal to the secondary structure-forming region, wherein the site of interest, in the absence of the primer, would be concealed by formation of the unwanted secondary structure. In contrast to prior methods for detecting nucleic acid sequences that are potentially "hidden" within a secondary structure, such as the methods discussed above, the present invention enables amplification using a single primer oligonucleotide, wherein the primer contains a blocking sequence that can be substantially shorter than the blocking probes of the prior art (e.g., those described by Hogan et al.) and does not have to have perfect complementarity with the region in the target molecule that forms the unwanted secondary structure.</p><p num="p0009">In another embodiment, a method is provided for using the dual-purpose primer in a method amplifying a target nucleotide sequence in a target molecule, wherein the target nucleotide sequence contains a site of interest proximal to or contained within a secondary structure forming region capable of forming an unwanted secondary structure in an amplicon formed under amplification conditions, and the method comprises: contacting the target nucleotide sequence under hybridizing conditions, together or soquentially, with a dual-purpose primer of the invention that is complementary to one terminus of a first strand of the target molecule, a second primer complementary to the opposing terminus of the second<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> strand of the target molecule, nucleotides appropriate to amplification, and an agent for polymerization of the nucleotides (e.g., a polymerase), wherein amplicons formed during the method do not contain the unwanted secondary structure, so that the site of interest is accessible to a hybridizing oligonucleotide.</p><p num="p0010">A preferred such method is implemented in the context of using PCR to ainplify a sequence of a double-stranded target DNA molecule having a first terminus and a second terminus, which comprises (a) heating a sample containing the double-stranded DNA to a temperature effective to denature the DNA and thereby provide a first single strand of DNA and a second strand of DNA, (b) contacting the denatured DNA with first and second oligonucleotide primers each comprised of a target binding sequence complementary to the first terminus of the first DNA strand and to the second terminus of the second DNA strand, respectively, (c) cooling the sample so as to allow hybridization of first and second oligonucleotide primers to the first and second strands of DNA, respectively, (d) replicating the DNA using a DNA polymerase, and repeating the aforementioned steps (a) through (d) to provide multiple copies of the sequence of double-stranded DNA, wherein the improvement comprises employing as the first primer a dual-purpose primer as provided herein.</p><p num="p0011">In a related embodiment, the invention encompasses an amplicon formed by the action of a DNA polymerase on a dual-purpose primer of the invention following hybridization of the primer to a target nucleotide sequence in a target molecule.</p><p num="p0012">In a further embodiment, kits are provided for carrying out amplification methods using a dual-purpose primer of the invention. One such kit is for determining the genotype of an individual, wherein the components of the kit include a dual-purpose primer of the invention, nucleotides appropriate to amplification of an oligonucleotide sequence, and an agent for polymerization of the nucleotides. Another kit for determining the genotype of an individual includes a dual-purpose primer of the invention, a second primer, nucleotides appropriate to DNA amplification, an agent for polymerization of the nucleotides, an allele specific hybridization (ASH) probe having a nucleotide capture region, and color-coded detecting means having a nucleotide capture region complementary to the nucleotide capture region on the ASH probe, wherein the nucleotide capture region on the detecting means is complementary to the ASH probe such that the target nucleotide sequence is identified by the color-coding of the detecting means.</p><p num="p0013">In another embodiment, the invention provides a dual-purpose hybridization probe that (a) a probe nucleotide sequence complementary to a first nucleotide sequence in a target molecule, and (b) a blocking sequence that is substantially complementary to a second nucleotide sequence in a target molecule, wherein hybridization of the blocking sequence with the second nucleotide sequence prevents<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> secondary structure formation in the second nucleotide sequence that would otherwise interfere with hybridization of the probe sequence to the first nucleotide sequence. The hybridization probe may be used in any assay format, although the probe is most useful in an assay for detecting the presence of a target nucleotide sequence in a target molecule wherein the target nuclcotide sequence is proximal to or contained within a secondary structure forming region capable of forming an unwanted secondary structure that would prevent detection of the target nuclcotide sequence.</p><heading><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION Of THE DRAWINGS</b></heading><p num="p0014">The file of this patent contains at least one drawing executed in color.

The blocker sequence (referred to as the "blocker region" and "B" in the figure) and the primer sequence (referred to as the "primer region" and "P" in the figure) are linked through a spacer region "S", wherein an optional base "O" is shown between S and P. The optional base prevents undesired priming 5' to the primer sequence P. The primer sequence is complementary to one terminus of the target molecule that contains the SNP site (designated "X"), and the blocking sequence is substantially complementary to a sequence B' immediately adjacent to X, wherein B' is the segment of the target molecule responsible for generating an intramolecular secondary structure that, in the absence of the dual purpose primer, would conceal the SNP site from a complementary sequence (thereby preventing<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> hybridization and detection). After amplification of the target nucleotide sequence and reannealing B hybridizes with B' in the amplicon, blocking formation of the unwanted secondary structure. Detection of the SNP site is accomplished using a label probe (referred to in the figure as the "ASH Label Probe").</p><p num="p0020">FIG. 6 shows an analytical gel demonstrating that the dual-purpose primers with blocker sequence inserts of 8, 10, and 12 nucleotides all generate a major band of expected size.</p><p num="p0021">FIG. 7 schematically illustrates multiplex differential hybridization with the dual-purpose primers of the invention.</p><p num="p0022">FIG. 8 is a bar graph comparing the results of the multiplex PCR assay used to detect SNPs in exon 1 of the cytochrome P450 CYP2D2 gene (SNP assay) using dual-purpose primers of the invention having 8, 10, or 12 nucleotide inserts, conventional primers, and conventional primers used in combination with a blocking oligonucleotide.</p><p num="p0023">FIG. 9 is a bar graph demonstrating the cytochrome P450 genotyping results of a multiplex SNP assay conducted on four individual patient samples.</p><p num="p0024">FIG.10 schematically illusvates a dual-purpose probe that prevents formation of an unwanted secondary structure and also enables ligation detection of SNPs.</p><heading><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="p0025">Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that unless otherwise indicated this invention is not limited to specific sources of DNA, specific sequences, or specific assay fonnats, as such may vary.

The nucleotides of any particular probe may be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or synthetic nucleotide analogs. The term "primer" refers to an oligonucleotide, whether produced naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, which is capable of acting as a point of initiation of synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product that is complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced, i.e., in the presence of appropriate nucleotides and an agent for polymerization such as a DNA polymerase in an appropriate buffer and at a suitable temperature.</p><p num="p0032">The term "support" refers to any solid surface (including semi-solid surfaces) to which a probe, analyte molecule, or other chemical entity may be anchored. Suitable support materials include, but are not limited to, supports that are typically used for solid phase chemical synthesis, e.g., polymeric<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> materials (e.g., polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylamide, polymethyl methacrylate, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, polycarbonate, divinylbenzene styrene-based polymers), agarose (e.g., Sepharose<sup>®</sup>), dextran (e.g., Sephadex<sup>®</sup>), cellulosic polymers and other polysaccharides, silica and silica-based materials, glass (particularly controlled pore glass, or "CPG") and functionalized glasses and ceramics. Preferred supports are solid substrates in the form of beads or particles, including microparticles and nanoparticles.</p><p num="p0033">By "PCR" is meant herein the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, disclosed by Mullis in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US4683195A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195 (Mullis et al</text></patcit>) and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US4683202A" status="new"><text>4,683,202</text></patcit>, incorporated herein by reference. In the PCR technique, short oligonucleotide primers are prepared that match opposite ends of a desired sequence, The sequence between the primers need not be known. A sample of DNA (or RNA) is extracted and denatured (preferably by heat). Then, oligonucleotide primers are added in molar excess, along with dNTPs and a polymerase (preferably Taq polymerase, which is stable to heat). The DNA is replicated, then again denatured. This results in two "long products," which begin with the respective primers, and the two original strands (per duplex DNA molecule). The reaction mixture is then retumed to polymerizing conditions (e.g., by lowering the temperature, inactivating a denaturing agent, or adding more polymerase), and a second cycle initiated. The second cycle provides the two original strands, the two long products from cycle 1, two new long products (replicated from the original strands), and two "short products" replicated from the long products. The short products have the sequence of the target sequence (sense or antisense) with a primer at each end. On each additional cycle, an additional two long products are produced, and a number of short products equal to the number of long and short products remaining at the end of the previous cycle. Thus, the number of short products grows exponentially with each cycle.

The target genome is generally a mammalian genome, and preferably a human genome, but can also be viral or bacterial. Target genomes include, but are not limited to, human hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and bovine papilloma virus (BFV).</p><p num="p0040">The term "singleplex" refers to a single assay that is not carried out simultaneously with any other assays.

Complementary nucleotides are, generally, A and T (or A and U), or C and G. Two single-stranded RNA or DNA molecules are said to be "complementary" when the nucleotides of one strand, optimally aligned and compared and with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions, pair with at least 90% to 95%, and more preferably at least about 98 to 99.5%. Two single-stranded RNA or DNA molecules are said to be "substantially complementzry" when the nucleotides of one strand, optimally aligned and compared and with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions, pair with at least about 80% of the nucleotides of the other strand.</p><p num="p0043">The term "arresting linker" as used herein refers to a nucleotidic or non-nucleotidic linker, in a probe or primer, which is not amplified by the amplification enzyme.</p><p num="p0044">The term "detectable label" as used herein refers to any atom or molecule that can be used to provide a detectable (preferably quantifiable) signal, and that can be attached to a nucleic acid or protein via a Covalent bond or noncovalent interaction (e.g., through ionic or hydrogen bonding, or via immobilization, adsorption, or the like). Labels generally provide signals detectable by fluorescence, chemiluminescence, radioactivity, colorimetry, mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction or absorption, magnetism, enzymatic activity, or the like. Suitable labels include fluorophores, chromophores, radioactive atoms (particularly <sup>32</sup>P and <sup>125</sup>I), electron-dense reagents, enzymes, and ligands having specific binding partners. Enzymes are typically detected by their activity. For example, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is usually detected by its ability to convert 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue pigment, quantifiable with a spectrophotometer. It should be understood that the above description is not meant to categorize the various labels into distinct classes, as a single label may be detected using two or more different methods. For example, <sup>125</sup>I can serve as a radioactive label and as an electron-dense reagent. HRP may serve as an enzyme or as an antigen for a monoclonal antibody (MAb). Further, one may combine various labels for a desired effect. For example, MAbs and avidin also require labels in the practice of this invention: thus, one might label a probe with biotin, and detect its presence with avidin labeled with <sup>125</sup>I, or with an anti-biotin MAb labeled with HRP, or with an HRP molecule conjugated to avidin or streptavidin.

Labeling oligonucleotides such as primers can be carried out using conventional coupling procedures. Specific coupling procedures, however, will vary depending on the reactive group or groups present on the label and/or on the oligonucleotide.</p><p num="p0049">For example, nick translation procedures known to those of skill in the art are available for substituting an unlabeled nucleotide with a labeled nucleotide through the use of DNase I and other enzymes, thereby providing a labeled amplicon. Another method for labeling includes the addition of a labeled deoxynucleotide terminal deoxynucleolidyl transferase (TdT, available from commercial suppliers such as PanVera Corp, Madison, Wisconsin), a DNA polymerase that can catalyze the addition of labeled deoxynucleotides to the 3'-end of DNA fragments.</p><p num="p0050">A second technique for preparing labeled ainplicons involves a separate labeling step wherein unlabeled amplicons are subsequently coupled to a label.

Such samples are known in the art and include, without limitation: blood; plasma; serum; spinal fluid; lymph fluid; cell lysates; semen; secretions of the skin or respiratory, intestinal, or genitourinary tracts; tears; saliva; milk; and white blood cells.</p><p num="p0053">The term "Single Nucleotide Polymorphism" (or "SNP") refers to a nucleic acid sequence differing in sequence by only one nucleic acid from a reference nucleic acid sequence, wherein the presence of the SNP is associated with a disease or other distinctive condition and thus serving an important diagnostic function. As illustrated in FIG. 1, a site of interest, such as an SNP, can be disposed within or near an intramolecular secondary structure and hence be unavailable for hybridization with a sequence-specific hybridization probe. In order to disrupt the secondary structure and render the "masked" sequences detectable, it is desirable to disrupt the region of the target nucleotide sequence using a blocking probe, so that the sequence of interest is not involved in an unwanted secondary structure and essentially "concealed" from a hybridization probe. <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="US5030557A"  status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 5,030,557 to Hogan et al.</text></patcit> suggests that the addition of an extraneous blocking probe is effective to prevent formation of such a secondary structure and allow a sequence of interest to be detected. Extraneous blocking probes, however, must be present at a large molar excess with respect to the concentration of the target nucleotide sequence to be effective, and thus, have the disadvantage of placing constraints on the size of the blocking sequence that will be effective. By contrast, the present invention provides primers and probes that are effective to prevent formation of the unwanted secondary structure without need for a separate "blocker" molecule. The primers and probes of the invention include a combination of a blocking sequence and a hybridization sequence (i.e., a "primer sequence" in a primer, and a "target binding sequence" in a probe). The combination primers, or "dual-purpose" primers, provide at least a 100-fold increase in signal relative to the use of conventional primers, and at least a 5-fold to 7-fold increase in signal relative to a corresponding amplification process carried out with an external blocking probe as described above (see Example 1) A probe comprising a blocking sequence can be used to detect any specific site of interest, and is not limited to SNPs or allelic variants, although these are generally the preferred sites of interest within a target nucleotide sequence. While a probe comprising a blocking sequence may be used with any target nucleotide sequence, it is most useful when the target nucleotide sequence forms an intramolecular secondary structure masking the detection of the specific sequence.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p num="p0054">To increase the sensitivity of detection of a specific target nucleotide sequence (e.g., a sequence associated with an allelic variant or an SNP), a primer has been designed that comprises a blocker sequence, wherein the blocker sequence hybridizes with a region of intramolecular secondary structure in the ampliton (corresponding to the region forming an intramolecular secondary structure in the target nucleotide sequence) so that the formation of the interfering intmmolecular secondary structure is disrupted by the blocker. A specific hybridization probe, such as an allele specific hybridization probe, can then be used to detect the sequence of interest in the amplicon.</p><p num="p0055">The primers and probes of the invention, and the methods of using the primers and probes, are described in greater detail below.</p><p num="p0056">In this embodiment a dual-purpose primer is provided that is used to amplify a target nucleotide sequence in a target molecule, the product of which is called an "amplicon." The target nucleotide sequence contains a site of interest proximal to or contained within a secondary structure forming region that, in the absence of the dual-purpose primer, results in an unwanted secondary structure in the amplicon that conceals the site of interest, i.e., prevents access to the site of interest by a hybridizing oligonucleotide. The site of interest is a nucleic acid sequence of two or more nucleotides, typically three or more nucleotides. Frcquently, the site of interest is a three-nucleotide sequence corresponding to a possible single nucleotide polymorphism.</p><p num="p0057">As illustrated in FIG. 5, the dual-purpose primer is complementary to one terminus of the target molecule containing the target nucleotide sequence. The primer contains a primer sequence (P) complementary to a segment of the target nucleotide sequence other than the secondary structure forming region (B'), and a blocking sequence (B) substantially complementary to a segment of the secondary stnicture-fonning region to prevent formation of the unwanted secondary structure. The primer sequence is relatively short, generally on the order of 10 to 30 bases in length. The blocking sequence can also be relatively short, significantly shorter than the blocking probes used in prior methods, as discussed elsewhere herein. For example, the blocking sequence may be only about 8 to 12 bases in length.</p><p num="p0058">The primer further indudes an optional spacer between the primer sequence and the blocking sequence, wherein the spacer is designed not to hybridize or interfere with the hybridization events necessary for carrying out the present methods, and, as such, is referred to herein as a "nonhybridizing" spacer. The spacer may be nucleotidic, e.g., comprised of a sequence of non-natural nucleotides such as iso-guanine and iso-cytosine, or a sequence of a recurring single nucleotide. The spacer may also be non-nucleotidic, e.g., comprised of a synthetic hydrophilic oligomer such as a poly(alkylene oxide) chain. Methods suitable for preparing the optional spacer are known from the literature. The preparation of<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> polyethylene glyool spacers is described, for example, by Kern et al. (1979) <i>Makromol. Chem.</i> 150:2539. Other spacers can be prepared in a similar manner.</p><p num="p0059">In a preferred embodiment, the primer includes a means for halting transcription between the probe sequence and a nucleotidic spacer. In general, the means for halting transcription is a linker joining the two primer segments that prevents the polymerase used from continuing replication across the probe sequence - nucleotidic spacer junction. Such linkers are referred to as "arresting linkers" herein. Preferred arresting linkers comprise at least one nucleotide modified so as to act in the aforementioned manner, wherein the modification is a molecular segment extending from the molecular core of a nucleoside, typically from a nitrogen atom contained within a purine or pyrimidine ring structure. Examples of particularly preferred arresting linkers include, without limitation, N<sup>4</sup>-modified pyrimidines such as 5-methyl-N<sup>4</sup>-(O-6-oxyhexyl)-2'-deoxyctyidine, 5-methyl-N<sup>4</sup>-(O-FMOC-6-oxyhexyl)-2'-deoxyctyidine, 5-methyl-N<sup>4</sup>-(O-levulinyl-6-oxyhexyl)-2'-deoxycytidine, and 5-methyl-N<sup>4</sup>-(O-6-oxyhexyl)-2'-thymidine, which are generally, although not necessarily, introduced during primer synthesis using the corresponding 3'- and S'-substituted nucleoside, e.g., a nucleoside substituted at the 3' position with DMT and at the 5' position with a phosphoramidite.

In the former case, the labeled primer will result in a labeled amplicon, as the labeled primers are incorporated into the amplicons. Labeled primers are available from commercial suppliers such as CPG, Inc. (Lincoln Park, New Jersey), or they can be prepared via conjugating a label to an unlabeled primer. Labeling oligonucleotides such as primers can be carried out using conventional coupling procedures. Specific coupling procedures, however, will vary depending on the reactive group or groups present on the label and/or on the oligonucleotide. Preferred labels include those moieties detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means.

Amplification may be carried out using conventional techniques, and although any known amplification method can be used, preferred methods include PCR, 3SR, and LCR, with PCR being most preferred.</p><p num="p0062">PCR amplification using the dual-purpose primers of the invention is carried out in a mixture comprising the target molecule, a dual-purpose primer complementary to one terminus of one strand of a double-stranded target molecule, a second oligonucleotide primer complcmentary to the opposing terminus of the second strand of the target molecule, an excess of the four oligonucleotide (dNTP) monomers, and water that contains a buffer suitable for carrying out PCR (including conveational buffers comprising Tris-HCl, KCl, and MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and an agent for polymerization of the nucleotides, e.g., a polymerase such as Taq polymerase. The mixture is then exposed to a series of replication cycles based on temperature. For example, the mixture is heated to about 94-96°C for several minutes during which time any double-stranded DNA is denatured into single-stranded DNA. Next, the temperature of the mixture is lowered to about 50-65°C, during which time the oligonucleotide primers hybridize via hydrogen bonds to complementary sequences, Finally, the temperature of the mixture is increased to about 72°C, during which time the polymerase binds and extends a complementary strand from each primer. Since the sequence being amplified doubles after each sample, a theoretical amplification of one billion can be attained, thereby providing ample nucleic acid analyte for the present method.</p><p num="p0063">A method of using the primer for amplification of a target nucleotide sequence is illustrated in FIG. 2. The blocking sequence provided in the amplicon disrupts the formation of the unwanted secondary structure in the amplicon, and therefore facilitates probing the site of interest (now in the amplicon) using the probe referred to in FIG. 2 as the "Differential Hybridization Probe" (see also FIG. 5). When the site of interest contains an allelic variation or an SNP site, the primer will amplify the region of the target nucleotide sequence containing the allelic variation or SNP site and then the allelic variation or SNP site can be detected using a differential hybridization probe comprising a detectable label or the like. Thus, the primers and methods of the invention are also useful in a method of determining the genotype of an individual.

The invention also facilitates the detection and analysis of an SNP or other target nucleotide sequence in a multiplexing mode, that is, in parallel hybridization experiments performed simultaneously, wherein the allele specific hybridization probes are each labeled with a unique label, as illustrated in FIG. 2. In a preferred embodiment, the unique label attached to each allele specific hybridization probe is a microsphere, which can advantageously be detected and analyzed using a flow cytometer.</p><p num="p0066">Optimally, a flow cytometer linked with one or more detecting means is used for detecting the complexes, although other means for detecting and counting the captured complaces can also be used, depending on the type of label and signal.

Preferably, the flow cytometer is linked with a first detecting means for detecting the label (of the labeled amplicon) as well as a second detecting means for detecting the signal associated with the solid substrate. Suitable equipment and methods for detecting the labels and signals using flow cytometry, and having the ability to perform multiplexing analysis, are described in <patcit id="pcit0013" dnum="US5981180A" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent Nos. 5,981,180 to Chandler et al.</text></patcit>, and <patcit id="pcit0014" dnum="US6046807A" status="new"><text>6,046,807 </text></patcit>and <patcit id="pcit0015" dnum="US6139800A" status="new"><text>6,139,800 to Chandler</text></patcit>.

In a most preferred embodiment, the microspheres are Luminex™ microspheres. However, for purposes of determining the genotype of an individual for a single allelic variation, two unique labels are sufficient to differentiate between the binding of the allele specific hybridization probe to the wild type allele compared with the binding of the allele specific hybridization probe to the variant allele.</p><p num="p0067">It will be appreciated that the probe and primer sequences need not have perfect complementarity to hybridize with the target nucleotide or amplicon thereof under hybridizing conditions. In using the probe of the invention as a hybridization probe to detect a specific sequence that may be present in a target nucleotide sequence, it is desirable that the stability of the hybridization of the blocking sequence with the target nucleotide sequence be approximately the same as the stability of the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> hybridization of the sequence-specific portion of the probe with the target nucleotide sequence. In this embodiment, the blocking sequence hybridizes with the secondary structure forming region of the target nucleotide sequence and blocks the secondary structure that interferes with hybridization of the sequence-specific portion of the probe, without providing a false positive result for hybridization of the sequence-specific portion of the probe. In practice, two probes are prepared that are designed to discriminate between two similar target nucleotide sequences, such as a wild type and mutant allele that it is desired to detect. The probes further comprise a unique identifying label and a sequence-specific portion designed to hybridize specifically with the sequence of the target nucleotide sequence that it is desired to detect.</p><p num="p0068">Alternatively, the secondary structure blocking sequence of the probe can hybridize more strongly with the target nucleotide sequence than the sequence-specific portion of the probe. To avoid the appearance of a false positive result, the sequence-specific portion of the hybridization probe must indicate or signal that it is hybridized with the target nucleotide sequence. The presence of a label such as a fluorescent probe in which the fluorescence is either enhanced or quenched by the presence of a duplex nucleotide would accomplish this result. Another useful signal would be a self-quenched fluorophore-quencher pair in the sequence-specific portion of the probe, wherein, upon binding to the target nucleotide sequence, the sequence containing the fluorophore-quencher pair assumes a linear configuration in which the fluorescence is no longer quenched.</p><p num="p0069">In addition to the primers described above, the invention also provides novel "dual-purpose" hybridization probes. The probes include: 1) a first probe nucleotide sequence complementary to a first target nucleotide sequence, and 2) a second probe sequence substantially complementary to a second target nucleotide sequence, wherein hybridization of the second probe sequence with the second target nucleotide sequence blocks secondary structure formation in the target nucleotide sequence that would otherwise interfere with binding of the first probe sequence to the first nucleotide sequence. The dual-purpose probes can be used in conjunction with any hybridization assay known in the art. The dual-purpose probes are particularly useful when the target nucleotide sequence, whether RNA or DNA, forms unwanted secondary structures as described above, wherein the secondary structures effectively mask the site of interest contained within the target nucleotide sequence. The second (blocking) sequence of the probe disrupts formation of the secondary structure in the target nucleotide sequence and facilitates probing the site of interest with the first probe nucleotide sequence. The probe is particularly useful when the sequence of interest contains an allelic variation or SNP site, which would not otherwise be detectable, and thus provides an improved method of determining the genotype of an individual.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --></p><p num="p0070">The novel probe of the present invention can be used for the dual purpose of secondary structure disruption coupled with ligation detection.

An allele specific hybridization (ASH) probe is an example of a preferred probe. When a target nucleotide sequence is amplified using a dual-purpose primer of the invention, the blocking sequence of the primer hybridizes with the secondary structure-forming region of the amplified target nucleotide sequence containing the particular allele or SNP, Because the blocking sequence hybridizes with the target nucleotide sequence, the ASH probe is able to hybridize with the region of the target nucleotide sequence that contains the allele or SNP, thus enabling detection of the allele or SNP.</p><p num="p0073">The novel probes can further comprise a capture sequence domain designed to hybridize with a detectable probe.

For example, the presence of a fluorescent probe, or the lack of fluorescent signal, as in fluorescence quenching, can be used. In another method of detection, a probe can be labetad with a radioactive label and detected with a scintillant, for example. In a preferred method, a probe can be attached to a fluorophore or other dye, or the probe can be attached to a solid substrate labeled with a fluorophore or other dye. In a preferred method, the probes contain a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence labeled with a detectable label, for example, a nucleic acid probe labeled with a tluorophorc.

In the assay employing the multimer, the initial steps are followed of hybridizing the analyte to label or amplifier probe sets, capturing probe sets in a first vessel, and transferring the complex to another vessel containing immobilized nucleic acid that will hybridize to a segment of the capturing probes.

A PE 9600 thermocycler was used.

The PCR plate with the multiplex working reagent was incubated for 10 minutes at 95°C to dissociate double-stranded DNA, followed by a 30-minute incubation at 50°C to achieve allele specific hybridization. The plate was removed and 100 µL of wash buffer was added to each well (HIV 3.0 Wash A, Bayer Diagnostics). The contents of the wells were transferred to a 96 well pre-wetted filter plate (Multiscreen<sup>®-</sup>BV 1.2µm, Millipore, Bedford MA).

Control blocker molecules were added at the same concentration. The cytochrome P450 SNP assay as set forth above was then performed using the dual-purpose primers. FIG. 7 is a schematic representation of this protocol. As shown in FIG. 8, the net signal detected in the SNP assay increased with the increasing length of the blocking sequences. By contrast, when no blocker sequence was used, little signal was generated (see column labeled<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> "conventional" in FIG. 8). When a 25 nucleotide external blocker sequence was used with the conventional primer, a 15 to 20-fold increase in the signal was seen over the primer having no blocker (see column labeled "conventional + blocker" in FIG. 8); however, the effectiveness of the 25 nucleotide external blocker was significantly less than the effectiveness of the dual-purpose primer with the 12 nucleotide blocker insert; the latter showing a two-fold net increase in signal over the 25 nucleotide external blocker.</p><heading><b>EXAMPLE 2</b></heading><heading><b>DETECTION OF WILD TYPE OR MUTANT ALLELES FOR</b></heading><heading><b>EXONS 1, 2, 6, AND 9 OF CYTOCHROME P450 CPY2D6</b></heading><p num="p0097">To detect wild type or mutant alleles for exons 1,2,6, and 9 of the cytochrome P450 CPY2D6 gene, the multiplex PCR assay set forth above was used to detect SNPs in each of the four exons. To carry out this procedure, primer sets were designed to amplify the specific regions corresponding to exons 1, 2, 6, and 9 of the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 gene. The resulting amplicons were hybridized via direct capture to ASH probes specific for the wild-type and mutant alleles. Where appropriate, dual purpose primers were used to disrupt secondary structure. Each of the ASH probes contained unique sequence domains complementary to a target sequence on a specific color-coded Luminex™ microsphere. To lower potential cross-reactivity between capture sequences on the ASH probes and the Luminex™ microspheres, non-natural iso-cytosine and iso-guanine bases were incorporated into the capture sequences on the ASH probes and the Luminex™ microspheres. Using this multiplexing assay, the mutant and wild-type alleles were readily identifiable according to the color of the Luminex™ microspheres.</p><p num="p0098">The ASH probes and Tm for each of the wild-type (top) and mutant (bottom) alleles of exons 1, 2, 6, and 9 of the cytochrome P450 CPY2D6 gene are set forth below. The Tm for the ASH probes designed to hybridize with the wild-type amplicon sequences are at least 10°C more stable (i.e., melting at least 10°C higher) than the ASH probes designed to hybridize with mutant amplicon sequences. These melting temperatures are consistent with the 10°C predicted difference in melting temperatures for one base pair mismatched sequences. Under this rubric, the allele specific hybridization probe for mutant amplicon sequences will be more stable by at least 10°C when the mutant amplicon sequences are present.
