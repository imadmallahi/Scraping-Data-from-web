No. 08/420,389, filed Apr. 12, 1995, now abandoned.</p><?description-type Brief Summary?><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Conventional organic solvent based polymer compositions have become disfavored due to problems associated with environmental pollution, conservation of resources and providing a safe working environment. Instead, aqueous solution or dispersion type coating compositions have been proposed as alternatives. In particular, much attention has been paid to reactive polymer emulsions and dispersions because of the ease with which they provide improved properties such as water and solvent resistance.</p><p>The use of combinations of polymers, aqueous emulsions and dispersions (latices) and epoxy resins or compounds is well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,049,869 to Long taught a composition including a high acid acrylic latex (5 to 20% by weight), a crosslinking agent (1 to 10%) and an ultraviolet absorber for use in preserving porous inorganic substrates. The crosslinking agent can include an epoxy resin.</p><p>Water-soluble silanes as additives in latex systems have also been disclosed in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,632 to Bredow disclosed coating compositions for Portland cement or metal. The coating composition thereof can be mixed from a pair of storage stable components; a dry mix including a fine particle size filler, an epoxy resin and optionally, a coarse aggregate, and a wet mix including a polymer latex, an amine-functional epoxy curing agent, and a water-soluble epoxy- or amino-silane.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,955 to Pons disclosed coating and adhesive compositions based on aqueous dispersions of addition polymers of one or more olefinically unsaturated monomers, emulsion stabilizers and/or emulsifiers and a water-soluble epoxysilane. The water-soluble epoxysilane is added preferably after the polymerization of the addition polymer. The shelf life, however, of such compositions is only from two to three days.</p><p>EP Patent No. 401,496 to Hahn disclosed aqueous silicon-modified plastic dispersions as adhesives by epoxysilane-treatment of a dispersion of emulsion copolymers containing carboxylic acid, amide and sulfonic acid groups. Water soluble epoxysilanes of the formula R.sub.1 R.sub.2 R.sub.3 R.sub.4 Si are disclosed with R.sub.1 =(cyclo)alkyl with reactive oxirane group; R.sub.2 =(cyclo)alkoxy, (cyclo)alkyl, aryl or aralkyl; R.sub.3, R.sub.4 =(cyclo)alkoxy, or OH. However, the composition of the synthetic latex is specific. Furthermore, the neat epoxysilane is added directly to the polymer.</p><p>In addition to these coating technologies, emulsions of trialkoxysilanes have been previously reported used as waterproofing agents. For example, buffered aqueous silane emulsions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,877,654 and 5,393,330. Alkylalkoxysilanes are also emulsified with nonionic and anionic emulsifiers for water repellency properties in U.S. Pat. No. 5,226,954.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention provides shelf stable compositions comprised of epoxysilane, a water dispersible or emulsifiable organic polymer which contains a functional group with an active hydrogen, together with a catalyst for curing the composition.. The corresponding method of the present invention for the preparation of a shelf stable composition comprises combining an epoxysilane compound in water with the organic polymer which contains a functional group with an active hydrogen, and adding at any point a catalyst for curing the composition..</p><p>One embodiment of the present invention provides shelf stable compositions comprised of water-insoluble or slightly soluble epoxysilanes, emulsifier and a water dispersible or emulsifiable organic polymer which contains a functional group with an active hydrogen, together with a catalyst for curing the composition.. The method of the present invention for the preparation of such a shelf stable composition comprises: (a) dispersing a water insoluble or slightly soluble epoxysilane compound in an aqueous solution with emulsifier to yield an aqueous emulsion, and (b) adding the silane emulsion to a water dispersed or emulsified organic polymer which contains a functional group with an active hydrogen, and adding at any point a catalyst for curing the composition..</p><p>Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an article coated and cured with any of the aforementioned reactive, aqueous compositions.</p><p>The compositions of the present invention are stable for at least about six (6) months. Moreover, improved properties such as solvent resistance, adhesion, smoothness, hardness and mar resistance are achieved with compositions of the present invention.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention provides stable epoxy silane containing compositions and methods for the preparation of stable epoxy-silane containing compositions comprising: (I) an epoxysilane, which can be a water soluble, water insoluble or slightly soluble epoxysilane; (II) optional emulsifier; (III) water; (IV) water dispersible or emulsified polymer containing a functional group with an active hydrogen; and (V) a catalyst for cure of the composition. Also provided are two part systems such that an epoxysilane emulsion comprising components (I)-(III) are combined and the components (IV) and (V) may be added upon use of components (I) to (III). Moreover, additional components, such as pH buffers may be added. Contemplated herein are also compositions for the preparation of the above compositions, namely the silane (I), the emulsifier (II), and the catalyst (V).</p><p>The present invention provides highly stable epoxysilane containing compositions that do not seed or gel during storage. Generally, they are stable for at least two to three weeks and more preferably two to three months. In fact, these compositions containing less than twenty weight percent epoxysilane last longer than six months of storage. This compares favorably with the prior art which taught silane/polymer compositions which would lose properties, such as adhesion, or even gel after two-three weeks.</p><p>The catalyst can be any that permits curing of the composition at lower temperatures, on the order of 150 compositions not containing the catalyst. The presence of the catalyst provides the additional advantage that one can use relatively water-soluble epoxysilanes and catalysts, thus providing greater freedom of operation and permitting the user to avoid having to use an emulsifier where such a component is not desired.</p><p>The cured product exhibits very satisfactory to superior properties such as high resistance to chemicals and high resistance to stains.</p><p>(I) SILANES</p><p>The epoxy functional silanes useful herein are of the general structure R.sup.1.sub.a R.sup.2.sub.b Si(OR.sup.3).sub.4-a-b where R.sup.1 is an epoxy substituted alkyl or aralkyl group, where the alkyl may have from four to thirty carbon atoms, R.sup.3 is an alkyl or alkoxy-substituted alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group having from one to ten carbon atoms, R.sup.2 is an alkyl group or alkoxy substituted alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group having from one to ten carbon atoms, a is one to three, and b is zero to two, with the proviso that a+b is 1, 2, or 3.

Illustrative of suitable branched chain hydrocarbon radicals for R.sup.2 are alkyl radicals such as isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, sec-amyl, and 4-methyl-2-pentyl. Alkoxyalkyl groups may be exemplified by n-butoxy ethyl and methoxy propyl. Aryl groups may be exemplified by phenyl and aralkyl groups may be exemplified by benzyl or ethyl phenyl.</p><p>Water soluble epoxysilanes can be provided by formulating such that all R.sup.3 groups are methyl.

These hydrocarbon groups may be substituted by halogen atoms and functional groups, including cyano and epoxy, for a part or all of the hydrogen atoms therein.</p><p>Examples of epoxy functional silanes used in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, those silanes described by Brison and Lefort in French Patent No. 1,526,231. Specific examples are 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyltriethoxysilane, 4-(methyldiethoxysilyl)-1,2-epoxycyclohexane, 3-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)propyl tri(isobutoxy) silane, 3-(2,3-epoxybutoxy)propyltriethoxysilane, and [2.2.1] bicycloheptane 2,3-epoxy-5-(2-triethoxysilyl)ethyl.</p><p>The silane(s) is present at 0.1 to 30 percent by weight of the total composition [(I)-(V)]. The preferred concentration is about 0.1 to 10 percent of the weight of the total composition.

The method for selecting the optimum HLB for a substance is well known to one skilled in the art and described in "The HLB System" by ICI Americas Inc.</p><p>Because the reactive polymer emulsion, as defined by components (II)-(IV), may be prepared prior to the addition of the precursor epoxy silane emulsion, emulsifiers of the type described above can be used in preparing these precursor compositions. Again, the emulsifiers are chosen so that the appropriate HLB is chosen to correspond to the HLB of the specific reactive polymer being emulsified with the proviso that the emulsifier(s) chosen to emulsify the reactive polymer are compatible with the emulsifier(s) used to make the precursor epoxysilane emulsion. In the precursor reactive polymer emulsion, the emulsifier should be present at 1 to 50 weight percent of the reactive polymer.</p><p>(III) WATER</p><p>The water may be present in an amount ranging from 29.85 to 99.75 weight percent of the total composition (I)-(IV). When a precursor silane emulsion is made without the polymer, about 39 to 99.75% water should be present.</p><p>(IV) POLYMERS</p><p>The reactive polymers of the present invention are those which have an active hydrogen thereon, preferably in the form of a carboxylic group. Exemplary of such polymers are those which contain terminal or pendant carboxyl groups (--COOH), some of which may be in its neutralized salt form (e.g., --COOK).

Such agents may be present at 0.1 to 20 weight percent of the total composition, as long as they do not destabilize the composition during storage.</p><p>The pH of the total composition may impact upon its hydrostability. High alkalinity or high acidity of the composition catalyzes the hydrolysis and condensation of the alkoxysilyl group of the epoxy silane. The closer the pH of the composition is to neutral (pH=7), the better the stability of the emulsion. Therefore, the preferred range of pH of the total composition is 5.5 to 8.5.

If desired, an emulsifier (II) is added and the mixture is stirred to provide a white, milky emulsion. The pH of the resulting aqueous solution or emulsion is adjusted, if necessary, to pH 7+-.1.5.</p><p>The precursor epoxysilane solution or emulsion is added to the reactive polymer (IV) or to a reactive polymer emulsion [Components (II)-(IV)] to provide a stable composition. The method employed to mix these components is not critical and any commonly used low shear equipment, such as a blade or paddle mixer, is suitable. The catalyst (V) and any optional ingredients (VI) may be added at any time, although in some cases catalysts should be added last.</p><p>The solutions and emulsions may be used as two component systems, i.e., components (I)-(III) and components (IV)-(V), mixed in shortly before use, but have sufficient stability when mixed to be used as one-component systems. The composition of components (I)-(V) form uniform aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions. Many uses of these compositions require drying under ambient conditions or at moderately elevated temperatures (e.g., baking). The resulting dried material has excellent solvent resistance, chemical resistance, hardness, mar resistance, adhesion, water resistance, durability or weatherability.</p><p>The compositions made according to the present invention may be used as industrial and architectural coatings, sealants, wood coating, adhesives and in mastics, i.e., generally in any application where the polymer would be used. For example, in textile print paste applications, the composition of the present invention would provide crock resistant colorfast applications. In wood coating, the present compositions would provide stain resistance, mar resistance and block resistance between latex surfaces in storage. As to architectural coatings, the present composition would provide scrub resistance and other improved properties. In sealants, the present composition would provide adhesion to inorganic surfaces. As is clear to one of ordinary skill in the art, there is vast array of applications of the present invention in coating, sealant, adhesives, masonry sealers, fiberglass binders and sizes, inks and other water-borne polymer systems.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>1.

Shelf Life Stability--The shelf life stability of the stable epoxy silane emulsions containing acid modified polymer dispersions or emulsions containing acid modified polymer dispersions or emulsions (Components I-IV) and the comparative examples were determined by measuring the viscosity of these compositions at various times after preparation. The viscosity was visually monitored for flow properties by titling a bottle containing the compositions back and forth or by measuring the viscosity of the compositions at 25 stabilities of the compositions are reported in Table II.</p><p>These examples show that the stable epoxy emulsions containing acid modified polymers (Components I-IV) are shelf stable for a period greater than 12 weeks provided that the pH of the composition is relatively neutral. For example, Example 27 has 10 weight percent Silane A and UCAR latex 100 and at a pH=6, had a viscosity of 1300 cP after storing at room temperature for 12 weeks. The compositions of comparative examples XXXIII and XXXV, where 10 percent of the Silane A was simply mixed with UCAR latex 100 showed an increase in viscosity, as shown in Examples 38 and 39, respectively. Comparative example XXXIII had an increase in viscosity to 3000 cP after storing at room temperature for 12 weeks. Comparative example XXXV gelled within 12 weeks.</p><p>The shelf life of the stable epoxy emulsions is important to the end use properties. For example, compositions described in Example 24 were stable for a period of 12 weeks and form a film with a smooth surface upon drying as shown in Example 67. Comparative Example XXVIII, although it did not show a change in viscosity after 12 weeks, produced a poor quality film, as shown in Example 68. This film had a cracked surface and fish eyes. The source of the surface defects was attributed to the hydrolysis and condensation of the epoxy silane to form microgels and oils.</p><p>The pH of the compositions can have a pronounced effect on the stability of the compositions. For example, the viscosity of compositions set forth by Example 22 gradually increased and finally gelled after 24 weeks, as shown in Example 75. The increase in viscosity was attributed to the alkalinity of the composition. The pH of the composition was 8.6. These compositions may be useful as a two-component system where long pot time is required.</p><p>The stability of Example 32 was observed to be poor, as shown in Example 53. Silane B is slightly soluble in water and the water solubility of this silane makes the preparation of a stable precursor epoxy emulsion difficult. The precursor epoxy silane emulsion described in Example 3 gelled within one month. Lowering the water solubility of Silane B by changing the alkoxy groups attached to the silicon atom can significantly improve the stability of the precursor epoxy silane emulsion. For example, the precursor silane emulsion described in Example 6 was stable. Of note, Silane D is insoluble in water.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE II__________________________________________________________________________Data showing that the compositions of present invention (I-IV) form morestable mixtures  than simple addition of epoxy silane or additive to aqueous emulsion ordispersion of an acid modified polymers and produce good film quality.

Solvent Resistance--The stable epoxy silane emulsions containing acid modified polymers are useful in improving the solvent resistance of films cast from them. The solvent resistance was determined by methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) double rubs. The tests were conducted according to ASTM D4752-87. Films were cured at 23 seven days or cured at 121 C. at 50% relative humidity for 7 days. The results of solvent resistance is reported in Table III.</p><p>The solvent resistance of films cast from compositions of the present invention was significantly better than films cast from the acid modified polymers alone. For example, the number of MEK double rubs of a film cast from compositions described in Example 16 and shown in Example 90 and cured at 121 III, a film of JONCRYL 77 withstood only 11 MEK rubs, as shown in Example 91. Simple mixtures of Silane A and JONCRYL 77, Comparative Example VIII, withstood only 34 rubs. In some cases, simple blends of epoxy silanes and polymers, such as Comparative Example XI, yield solvent resistant films shown in Example 94, but the shelf life of these compositions is poor. For example, Comparative Example XI gelled in two weeks, as shown in Example 56/</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE III______________________________________Data showing that the compositions of present  invention have improved solvent resistance, as  demonstrated by MEK double rubs      MEK double rubs          Cured at 23                        Cured at 121  Example Compo- 50% relative humidity for 20 min and then at 50%                         No. sition for 7 days 23                        relative humidity for 7 days______________________________________85      8      29            39  86  9 -- 40  87 10 26 --  88 11 -- 50  89 I 14  9  90 16 41 130  91 III 14 11  92 IX 41 169  93 XII 110  171  94 XI 87 127  95 VI  8  9  96 VII  45  97 VIII  34  98 XIII -- 11  99 XIV --  9  100  XV --  9  101  18 19 182  102  V  8  7  103  XVI  2 22  104  XX 57 241  105  XVIII -- 22  106  XXI 12 22  107  XIX -- 46  108  XXII -- 51  109  XXIII -- 14  110  XXIV -- 13  111  XXV --  8______________________________________ 1.

The sealant formulations are set forth in Table VI. The sealants were prepared by charging UCAR latex polymer 105 and TRITON X-405 into a mixing vessel and stirring for five minutes. A solution of NUOCEPT 95 preservative, TRITON X-405 surfactant and water was added to the mixing vessel and stirred for five minutes. The ethylene glycol, TEMOL 850 dispersing agent, ASE 60 thickener, KTPP potassium tripolyphosphate, and SANTICISER 160 plasticizer were added and mixed using a high speed mixing propeller. Mineral spirits, precursor epoxy silane emulsion or silicone additive and ammonium hydroxide were added and mixed using a spatula. A MOLTINI PLANAMAX mixer was used to stir the mixture for 20 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere. The TiO.sub.2 and DMDEE (2,2-dimorpholino diethyl ether) catalysts were added and mixed for five minutes. The mixture was degassed under reduced pressure for five minutes. The sealant was stored in a plastic sealant tube.</p><p>The sealants were cured at 23 three weeks in an environmental chamber and 1 week at ambient conditions.
