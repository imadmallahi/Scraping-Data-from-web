recording high in quality of an image obtained, excellent in
keeping quality, and moreover, excellent in ejection stability,
a cartridge and an image recording method.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0002">With the recent popularization of computers, ink jet
printers have been widely used for making prints on paper, films,
cloth and so on, not only in offices but also in homes.</p><p num="0003">The ink jet recording processes include a system in which
ink droplets are ejected by the application of pressure with
piezoelectric elements, a system in which bubbles are generated
in ink by heat, thereby ejecting ink droplets, a system using
a ultrasonic wave and a system in which ink droplets are sucked
and ejected by electrostatic force. As inks for ink jet
recording used in these systems, aqueous inks, oil-based inks
and solid (melt type) inks are used. Of these inks, the aqueous
inks have prevailed from the viewpoints of easy production,
convenience in handling, odors and safety.</p><p num="0004">Coloringmaterials used in these inks for ink jet recording
have been required to have excellent solubility in solvents,
the possibility of high-density recording, good hues, excellent 
resistance against light, heat, air, water and chemicals, good
fixing properties and the difficulty of blotting to
image-receiving materials, excellent keeping quality as the
inks, no toxicity, high purity and furthermore availability
at low cost. However, it is extremely difficult to seek a
coloring material satisfying these requirements at high levels.
In particular, a coloring material having a good magenta hue
and excellent in light fastness has been strongly desired.</p><p num="0005">Various dyes and pigments have been already proposed as
those for ink jet, and practically used. However, no coloring
material satisfying all of these requirements has been
discoveredyet under thepresent circumstances. It is difficult
to allow both the hue and the fastness required for the inks
for ink jet recording to be compatible with each other, by using
the dyes and pigments that have hitherto been well known (such
as those having Color Index (C.I.) Number) . As dyes improving
fastness, there have been proposed azo dyes derived from aromatic
amines and 5-membered heterocyclic amines described in
JP-A-55-161856 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"). However,
these dyes have unfavorable hues in yellow and cyan regions,
so that they have the problem of deteriorating color reproduction.
JP-A-61-36362 and JP-A-2-212566 disclose inks for ink jet
recording intending to allow hues and light fastness to be
compatible. However, dyes used therein are insufficient in 
solubility in water, when used as water-soluble inks. Further,
when the dyes described therein are used as water-soluble ink-jet
ink, a problem is encountered also with regard to wet heat
fastness. As means for solving these problems, there have been
proposed compounds and ink compositions described in
JP-T-11-504958 (the term "JP-T" as used herein means a published
Japanese translation of a PCT patent application). Further,
in order to improve hues and light fastness, inks for ink jet
recording using pyrazolylanilineazo are described in Japanese
Patent Application No. 2000-80733. However, in these inks for
ink jet recording, it has become clear that deterioration of
images occurs in some cases, when the inks are placed under
severe conditions such as long-term storage at high temperatures,
or when a gas such as a nitrogen oxide or ozone coexists therewith.
In order to improve these disadvantages, the dye species has
been studied. However, in gray or a secondary color such as
blue, the effect of fastness is not sufficiently observed only
when one kind of dye is changed, because of off-balanced hues.
Further, the fastness becomes worse in some cases by an
interaction due to mixing of two kinds of dyes. Accordingly,
an ink set which can significantly improve the fastness, a
cartridge, a printer using them, and highly fast printed matter
have been desired.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENITON</heading><p num="0006">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide
an ink set excellent in respect to handling, odors and safety,
high in ejection stability, moreover also excellent in hues,
light resistance and water resistance of an image obtained,
having no drawback with regard to image quality such as blotting
of a thin line, and improved in image keeping quality under
severe conditions. Another object of the invention is to
provide an ink set, a cartridge and an image recording method,
in which even an ink kept for a long period of time or under
severe conditions is high in ejection stability.</p><p num="0007">Various studies by the present inventors have proved that
the use of a specific black ink as an ink for ink jet recording
provide highly fast printed matter without the deterioration
of an image even under severe conditions such as long-term
storage at high temperatures or under conditions in which a
gas coexists. The deterioration of an image under severe
conditions and/or under the coexistence of a gas is particularly
remarkable on image receiving paper containing a white inorganic
pigment in an image receiving layer, and it is presumed that
the deterioration is affected by the reaction with the white
inorganic pigment itself or the gas component adsorbed by the
white inorganic pigment, as well as the deterioration reaction
caused by heat.</p><p num="0008">That is to say, the invention relates to an ink cartridge
containing integrally a specific black ink or independently 
at least a part thereof, in which a yellow ink, a magenta ink
and a cyan ink are used in combination. Further, the invention
relates to an ink jet printer and an image recording method
using this ink set or ink cartridge.</p><p num="0009">That is to say, the invention relates to an ink set, an
ink cartridge, an ink jet printer and an image recording method,

[hour<sup>-1</sup>] or less, in which the forced fading rate constant is
decided by dissolving and/or dispersing the dye in an aqueous
medium to form an ink composition for ink jet recording, printing
the ink composition on a reflection type medium, thereafter
measuring a reflection density through a Status A filter,
specifying one point having a reflection density (D<sub>s</sub>) in an
yellow region of 0. 90 to 1.10 as an initial density of the ink,

specification will be described here. Hammett's rule is an
empirical rule propounded by L. P. Hammett in 1935 in order
to quantitatively deal with the influence of a substituent group
on the reaction and equilibrium of a benzene derivative, and
the validity thereof has today been widely recognized. As the
substituent constants determined in Hammett's rule, there are
the σp value and the σm value. These constants are described
in detail, for example, in <i>Lange's Handbook of Chemistry</i>, the
12th edition, edited by J. A. Dean, 1979 (McGraw-Hill) and <i>Kagakuno Ryoiki</i>
(Journal of Japanese Chemistry) , an extra issue, 122,
96-103 (1979), Nankodo, although they can be found in many
general literatures. In the invention, each substituent group
is limited or illustrated by the Hammett substituent constant
σp. However, this does not mean that the substituent group
is limited to only a substituent group having the constant known
in the above-mentioned general literatures. Even when the
constant is unknown in literatures, it goes without saying that
a substituent group having the constant that will be within
the range when measured based on Hammett' s rule is also included.
Further, although the compounds represented by general formula
(1) or (2) of the invention also include some compounds other
than the benzene derivatives, the σp value is used as a measure 
indicating the electronic efficiency of the substituent group,
independently of the substituted position. In the invention,
the σp value is used in such a sense.</p><p num="0069">Examples of the electron attractive groups having a

the validity thereof has today been widely recognized. As the
substituent constants determined in Hammett's rule, there are
the σp value and the σm value. These constants are described
in detail, for example, in <i>Lange's Handbook of Chemistry</i>, the
12th edition, edited by J. A. Dean, 1979 (McGraw-Hill) and <i>Kagaku
no Ryoiki</i> (Journal of Japanese Chemistry), an extra issue, <i>122</i>,
96-103 (1979), Nankodo, although they can be found in many
general literatures. In the invention, each substituent group
is limited or illustrated by the Hammett substituent constant
σp. However, this does not mean that the substituent group
is limited to only a substituent group having the constant known
in the above-mentioned general literatures. Even when the
constant is unknown in literatures, it goes without saying that
a substituent group having the constant that will be within
the range when measured based on Hammett' s rule is also included.
Further, although the compounds represented by general formula
(1a) of the invention also include some compounds other than
the benzene derivatives, the σp value is used as a measure
indicating the electronic efficiency of the substituent group,
independently of the substituted position. In the invention,

in a 0 .1- to 3-fold excess amount, preferably in a 0.5- to 1. 0-fold
excess amount, by weight in relation to the dye.</p><p num="0281">In the invention, when the hydrophobic dye, the high
boiling organic solvent and other additives are hydrophobic,
they are emulsified and dispersed in the aqueous medium to use.
In emulsifying and dispersing them, a low boiling organic solvent
can be used in combination with them from the viewpoint of
emulsifying properties in some cases. The low boiling organic
solvent is an organic solvent having a boiling point of about
30°C to 150°C at ordinary pressure. Examples of the low boiling
organic solvents preferably used include but are not limited
to an ester (for example, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl
propionate, β-ethoxyethyl acetate ormethyl cellosolve acetate) ,
an alcohol (for example, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol
or sec-butyl alcohol), a ketone (for example, methyl isobutyl
ketone, methyl ethyl ketone or cyclohexanone), an amide (for
example, dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone) and an
ether (for example, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane).</p><p num="0282">Emulsification and dispersion are carried out in order
to disperse an oil phase in which the dye is dissolved in the
high boiling organic solvent or in the mixed solvent of the
high boiling organic solvent and the low boiling organic solvent 
in some cases into an aqueous phase mainly composed of water
to form micro oil droplets of the oil phase. In this case,
additives such as a surfactant, a wetting agent, a dye
stabilizing agent, an emulsion stabilizer, a preservative and
a fungicide, which are described later, can be added to either
of the aqueous phase and the oil phase or both as needed.</p><p num="0283">As the emulsification method, a method of adding the oil
phase to the aqueous phase is general. However, a so-called
phase inversion emulsification method of adding the aqueous
phase to the oil phase is also preferably usable.</p><p num="0284">In the emulsification and dispersion of the invention,
various surfactants can be used. Preferred examples thereof
include an anionic surfactant such as a fatty acid salt, an
alkyl sulfate, an alkylbenzenesulfonate, an alkylnaphthalenesulfonate,
a dialkylsulfosuccinate, an alkylphosphate, a
naphthalenesulfonic acid-formalin condensation product or a
polyoxyethylenealkylsulfate; and nonionic surfactant such as
a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, a polyoxyethylene alkyl allyl
ether, a polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester, a sorbitan fatty
acid ester, a polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, a
polyoxyethylenealkylamine, a glycerol fatty acid ester or an
oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymer. SURFYNOLS (Air
Products &amp; Chemicals), an acetylenic polyoxyethylene oxide
surfactant, is also preferably used. Further, amine oxide type
amphoteric surfactants such as an N,N-dimethyl-N-alkylamine 
oxide are also preferred. Furthermore, surfactants described
in JP-A-59-157636, pages 37 and 38, <i>Research Disclosure</i> No.
308119 (1989) and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2001-11821,
2001-11822, 2001-80690 and 2001-80659 can also be used.</p><p num="0285">In order to stabilize a dye dispersion just after
emulsification, a water-soluble polymer can also be added in
combination with the above-mentioned surfactant. As the
water-soluble polymer, there is preferably used polyvinyl
alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene oxide,
polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide or a copolymer thereof. A
natural water-soluble polymer such as a polysaccharide, casein
or gelatin is also preferably used. Further, in order to
stabilize the dye dispersion, a polyvinyl compound, a
polyurethane, a polyester, a polyamide, a polyurea or a
polycarbonate obtained by polymerization of an acrylate, a
methacrylate, a vinyl ester, an acrylamide, a methacrylamide,
an olefin, a styrene, a vinyl ether and an acrylonitrile, which
is substantially insoluble in the aqueous medium, . can also be
used in combination. It is preferred that these polymers
contain -SO<sup>2-</sup>or -COO<sup>-</sup>. When the polymer substantially insoluble
in the aqueous medium is used in combination, it is used
preferably in an amount of 20% by weight or less, and more
preferably in an amount of 10% by weight or less, based on the
high boiling organic solvent.</p><p num="0286">When the oil-soluble dye is dispersed by the 
emulsification and dispersion to prepare the aqueous ink,
particularly important is the control of its particle size.
In order to increase color purity and density in forming an
image by ink jet, it is indispensable to decrease the average
particle size. The volume average particle size is preferably
from 5 nm to 100 nm.</p><p num="0287">Further, it has become clear that the presence of coarse
particles plays a very major role in printing performance. That
is to say, it has been revealed that the coarse particles clog
nozzles of a head, or form stains, even when the coarse particles
do not clog the nozzles, which causes the failure of ink ejection
or the distortion of ink ejection to exert an important influence
on the printing performance. In order to prevent this, it is
important that particles having a size of 5 µm or more contained
in the ink is reduced to 10 particles or less, and that particles
having a size of 1 µm or more is reduced to 1,000 particles
or less.</p><p num="0288">As methods for removing these coarse particles, known
centrifugation and microfiltration can be used. These
separating means may be applied either just after the
emulsification and dispersion, or after various additives such
as the wetting agent and the surfactant have been added to the
emulsified dispersion and just before the resulting dispersion
is loaded in an ink cartridge.</p><p num="0289">As an effective means for reducing the average particle 
size and removing coarse particles, a mechanical emulsifier
can be used.</p><p num="0290">As the emulsifiers, known apparatus such as a simple
stirrer or impeller stirring system, an inline stirring system,
a mill system such as a colloid mill, and an ultrasonic system
can be used. However, the use of a high-pressure homogenizer
is particularly preferred.</p><p num="0291">As for the high-pressure homogenizer, a detailed
mechanism thereof is described in U.S. Patent 4,533,254 and
JP-A-6-47264. As commercially available apparatus, there are
a Gaulin homogenizer (A. P. V. GAULIN INC.), a Microfluidizer
(MICROFLUIDEX INC.) and an Ultimizer (Sugino Machine Limited).</p><p num="0292">The high-pressure homogenizer having a mechanism of
finely pulverizing particlesin ultra-high pressure jet streams,
which has recently been used and is described in U.S. Patent
5,720,551, is particularly effective. Examples of the
emulsifiers using the ultra-high pressure jet streams include
DeBEE 2000 (BEE INTERNATIONAL LTD.).</p><p num="0293">When the emulsification is conducted with the high--pressure
emulsifying disperser, the pressure is 500 bars or
more, preferably 600 bars or more, and more preferably 1800
bars or more. It is particularly preferred that two or more
types of emulsifiers are used in combination, for example, that
the dye dispersion is emulsified with the stirring emulsifier
and then passed through the high-pressure homogenizer. It is 
also preferred that the dye dispersion is once emulsified with
the emulsifier, and then passed through the high-pressure
homogenizer again after additives such as the wetting agent
and the surfactant have been added and before the resulting
ink is loaded in an ink cartridge.</p><p num="0294">When the low boiling organic solvent is contained in
addition to the high boiling organic solvent, it is preferred
from the viewpoints of stability of the emulsified product and
safety and health that the low boiling solvent is removed. As
methods for removing the low boiling solvent, various known
methods can be used depending on the type of solvent. That
is to say, such methods include evaporation, vacuum evaporation
and ultrafiltration. This process of removing the low boiling
organic solvent is preferably conducted as soon as possible
just after emulsification.</p><p num="0295">Examples of the water-soluble organic solvents available
in the invention include an alcohol (for example, methanol,
ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol,
sec-butanol, t-butanol, pentanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol or
benzyl alcohol), a polyhydric alcohol (for example, ethylene
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene
glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene
glycol, butylene glycol, hexanediol, pentanediol, glycerol,
hexanetriol or thiodiglycol) , a glycol derivative ( for example,
ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl 
ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol
monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene
glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether,
dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol
monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether,
ethylene glycol diacetate, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether
acetate, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether or ethylene glycol
monophenyl ether), an amine (for example, ethanolamine,
diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N--ethyldiethanolamine,
morpholine, N-ethylmorpholine,
ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine,
polyethyleneimine or tetramethylpropylenediamine), and
another polar solvent (for example, formamide, N,N-dimethylformamide,
N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide,
sulfolane, 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,
N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-oxazolidone,
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, acetonitrile or acetone).
The above-mentioned water-soluble organic solvents may be used
as a combination of two or more of them.</p><p num="0296">When the fine coloring particle dispersion obtained in
the invention is used as the ink for ink jet recording, additives
such as an anti-drying agent for preventing clogging caused
by drying of the ink in jet nozzles, a permeation accelerator
for allowing the ink to better permeate in paper, an ultraviolet
absorber, an antioxidant, a viscosity modifier, a surface 
tension adjuster, a dispersing agent, a dispersion stabilizer,
a fungicide, a corrosion inhibitor, a pH adjusting agent, an
antifoaming agent and a chelating agent can be accordingly
selected to use in suitable amounts.</p><p num="0297">As the anti-drying agent used in the invention, a
water-soluble organic solvent having a vapor pressure lower
than that of water is preferred. Specific examples thereof
include a polyhydric alcohol represented by ethylene glycol,
propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,
thiodiglycol, dithiodiglycol, 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol,
1,2,6-hexanetriol, an acetylene glycol derivative, glycerol
or trimethylolpropane; a lower alkyl ether of a polyhydric
alcohol such as ethylene glycol monomethyl (ormonoethyl) ether,
diethylene glycol monomethyl (or monoethyl) ether or triethylene
glycol monoethyl (or monobutyl) ether; a heterocycle
such as 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1, 3-dimethyl--2-imidazolidinone
or N-ethylmorpholine; a sulfur-containing
compound such as sulfolane, dimethyl sulfoxide or 3-sulfolene;
a multifunctional compound such as diacetone alcohol or
diethanolamine; and a urea derivative. Of these, a polyhydric
alcohol such as glycerol or diethylene glycol is more preferred.
The above-mentioned anti-drying agents may be used either alone
or as a combination of two or more of them. These anti-drying
agents are each preferably contained in the ink in an amount
of 10% to 50% by weight. </p><p num="0298">As the permeation accelerator used in the invention, there
can be used an alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol,
di(tri)ethylene glycol monobutyl ether or 1,2-hexanediol;
sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium oleate; or a nonionic surfactant.
When these are each contained in the ink in an amount of 10%
to 30% by weight, the effect is sufficiently achieved. It is
therefore preferred that these are each used within the range
of the amount added in which no blotting of print and no print
through occur.</p><p num="0299">As the ultraviolet absorbers used for improving image
keeping quality in the invention, there can be used benzotriazole
compounds described in JP-A-58-185677, JP-A-61-190537,

Furthermore, surfactants described in JP-A-59-157636, pages

be used.</p><p num="0308">The surface tension of the ink used in the invention is
preferably from 20 to 50 mN/m, and more preferably from 20 to
40 mN/m, at 25°C in both the dynamic surface tension and the
static surface tension. When the surface tension exceeds 50
mN/m, ejection stability is decreased, and blotting in color
mixing and smeared print edges occur to significantly
deteriorate print quality. On the other hand, when the surface
tension of the ink is less than 20 mN/m, the ink adheres to
a surface of hardware to cause poor print in some cases.</p><p num="0309">The viscosity of the ink of the invention is from 1 to
20 mPa·S, more preferably from 2 to 15 mPa·S, and particularly
preferably from 2 to 10 mPa·S, at 25°C. Exceeding 20 mPa·S results
in a slow fixing rate of a recorded image and deterioration 
of ejection performance, whereas less than 1 mPa·S results in
blotting of a recorded image to lower a quality level.</p><p num="0310">The viscosity of the ink is arbitrarily adjustable by
the amount of an ink solvent added. The ink solvents include,
