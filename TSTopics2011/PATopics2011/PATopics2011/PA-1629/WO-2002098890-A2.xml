The contents of the prior applications are hereby incorporated in their entirety.</p><p num="p0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0005">The p53 gene is mutated in over 50 different types of human cancers, including familial and spontaneous cancers, and is believed to be the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer (Zambetti andLevine, FASEB (1993) 7:855-865; Hollstein, etal., Nucleic Acids Res. (1994) 22:3551-3555). Greater than 90% of mutations in the p53 gene are missense mutations that alter a single amino acid that inactivates p53 function. Aberrant forms of human p53 are associated with poor prognosis, more aggressive tumors, metastasis, and short survival rates (Mitsudomi et al., Clin Cancer Res 2000 Oct; 6(10):4055-63; Koshland, Science (1993) 262:1953).</p><p num="p0006">The human p53 protein normally functions as a central integrator of signals including DNA damage, hypoxia, nucleotide deprivation, and oncogene activation (Prives, Cell (1998) 95:5-8). In response to these signals, p53 protein levels are greatly increased with the result that the accumulated p53 activates cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the nature and strength of these signals. Indeed, multiple lines of experimental evidence have pointed to a key role for p53 as a tumor suppressor (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331). For example, homozygous p53 "knockout" mice are developmentally normal but exhibit nearly 100% incidence of neoplasia in the first year of life (Donehower et ah, Nature (1992) 356:215-221).</p><p num="p0007">The biochemical mechanisms and pathways through which p53 functions in normal and cancerous cells are not fully understood, but one clearly important aspect of p53 function is its activity as a gene-specific transcriptional activator. Among the genes with known p53-response elements are several with well-characterized roles in either regulation of the cell cycle or apoptosis, including GADD45, p21/Wafl/Cipl, cyclin G, Bax, IGF- BP3, and MDM2 (Levine, Cell (1997) 88:323-331).</p><p num="p0008">Microtubules have a central role in the regulation of cell shape and polarity during differentiation, chromosome partitioning at mitosis, and intracellular transport. Microtubules undergo rearrangements involving rapid transitions between stable and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
dynamic states during these processes. Microtubule affinity regulating kinases (MARK) are a novel family of protein kinases that phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins and trigger microtubule disruption (Drewes, G., et al. (1997) Cell 89: 297-308).</p><p num="p0009">Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 1 (MARK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein tau, leading to disruption of microtubules. It shares 90% amino acid homology with the rat version of MARK1, and demonstrates ubiquitous expression with highest levels in testis and brain (Nagase, T. et al. (2000) DNA Res. 7: 143-150).</p><p num="p0010">EMKl (MARK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase with two isoforms, which differ by the presence or absence of a 162-bp alternative exon (Espinosa, L. and Navarro, E.</p><p num="p0011">(1998) Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 81:278-282). Both human isoforms are coexpressed in a number of cell lines and tissues, with the highest expression found in heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and at lower levels in lung, liver, and kidney (Inglis, J. et al. (1993) Mammalian Genome 4: 401-403). Due to the physical location of this gene, Ilql2-ql3, EMKl is a candidate gene for carcinogenic events (Courseaux, A. et al. (1995) Mammalian Genome 6: 311-312), and has been associated with colon and prostate cancer (Moore, T. M., et al. (2000) J Biol Chem 275:4311-22; Navarro, E., et al.</p><p num="p0012">(1999) Biochim Biophys Acta 1450: 254-64).</p><p num="p0013">Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 3 (MARK3) was originally identified as a marker (KP78) induced by treatment with DNA damaging agents. The loss of MARK3 was associated with carcinogenesis in the pancreas (Parsa, I. (1988) Cell Growth Differ. 9: 197-208). MARK3 may be involved in cell cycle regulation, and alterations in the MARK3 gene may lead to carcinogenesis. MARK 3 is ubiquitously expressed throughout human tissues, with an additional 3.0 Kb transcript present in the heart (Peng, C. et al. (1998) Cell Growth Differ. 9: 197-208).</p><p num="p0014">MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase like 1 (MARKL1) has two isoforms (Nagase, T. et al. (2001) DNA Res. 8: 85-95), is activated by the beta-catenin/Tcf complex in hepatic cell lines, and may be involved in hepatic carcinogenesis (Kato, T. et al. (2001). Neoplasia 3:4-9). The ability to manipulate the genomes of model organisms such as Drosophila provides a powerful means to analyze biochemical processes that, due to significant evolutionary conservation, has direct relevance to more complex vertebrate organisms. Due to a high level of gene and pathway conservation, the strong similarity of cellular processes, and the functional conservation of genes between these model organisms and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
mammals, identification of the involvement of novel genes in particular pathways and their functions in such model organisms can directly contribute to the understanding of the correlative pathways and methods of modulating them in mammals (see, for example, Mechler BM et al., 1985 EMBO J 4:1551-1557; Gateff E. 1982 Adv. Cancer Res. 37: 33- 74; Watson KL., et al., 1994 J Cell Sci. 18: 19-33; Miklos GL, and Rubin GM. 1996 Cell 86:521-529; Wassarman DA, et al., 1995 Curr Opin Gen Dev 5: 44-50; and Booth DR. 1999 Cancer Metastasis Rev. 18: 261-284). For example, a genetic screen can be carried out in an invertebrate model organism having underexpression (e.g. knockout) or overexpression of a gene (referred to as a "genetic entry point") that yields a visible phenotype. Additional genes are mutated in a random or targeted manner. When a gene mutation changes the original phenotype caused by the mutation in the genetic entry point, the gene is identified as a "modifier" involved in the same or overlapping pathway as the genetic entry point. When the genetic entry point is an ortholog of a human gene implicated in a disease pathway, such as p53, modifier genes can be identified that may be attractive candidate targets for novel therapeutics.</p><p num="p0015">All references cited herein, including sequence information in referenced Genbank identifier numbers and website references, are incorporated herein in their entireties.</p><p num="p0016">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have discovered genes that modify the p53 pathway in Drosophila, and identified their human orthologs, hereinafter referred to as MARK. The invention provides methods for utilizing these p53 modifier genes and polypeptides to identify candidate therapeutic agents that can be used in the treatment of disorders associated with defective p53 function. Preferred MARK-modulating agents specifically bind to MARK polypeptides and restore p53 function. Other preferred MARK-modulating agents are nucleic acid modulators such as antisense oligomers and RNAi that repress MARK gene expression or product activity by, for example, binding to and inhibiting the respective nucleic acid (i.e. DNA or mRNA).</p><p num="p0017">MARK-specific modulating agents may be evaluated by any convenient in vitro or in vivo assay for molecular interaction with a MARK polypeptide or nucleic acid. In one embodiment, candidate p53 modulating agents are tested with an assay system comprising a MARK polypeptide or nucleic acid. Candidate agents that produce a change in the activity of the assay system relative to controls are identified as candidate p53 modulating agents. The assay system may be cell-based or cell-free. MARK-modulating agents 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
include MARK related proteins (e.g. dominant negative mutants, and bio therapeutics); MARK-specific antibodies; MARK-specific antisense oligomers and other nucleic acid modulators; and chemical agents that specifically bind MARK or compete with MARK binding target. In one specific embodiment, a small molecule modulator is identified using a kinase assay. In specific embodiments, the screening assay system is selected from a binding assay, an apoptosis assay, a cell proliferation assay, an angiogenesis assay, and a hypoxic induction assay.</p><p num="p0018">In another embodiment, candidate p53 pathway modulating agents are further tested using a second assay system that detects changes in the p53 pathway, such as angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation changes produced by the originally identified candidate agent or an agent derived from the original agent. The second assay system may use cultured cells or non-human animals. In specific embodiments, the secondary assay system uses non-human animals, including animals predetermined to have a disease or disorder implicating the p53 pathway, such as an angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation disorder (e.g. cancer).</p><p num="p0019">The invention further provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway in a mammalian cell by contacting the mammalian cell with an agent that specifically binds a MARK polypeptide or nucleic acid.

The KP78a gene was identified as a modifier of the p53 pathway. Accordingly, vertebrate orthologs of these modifiers, and preferably the human orthologs, microtubule affinity regulator kinase (MARK) genes (i.e., nucleic acids and polypeptides) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of pathologies associated with a defective p53 signaling pathway, such as cancer. In vitro and in vivo methods of assessing MARK function are provided herein.</p><p num="p0022">Modulation of the MARK or their respective binding partners is useful for understanding the association of the p53 pathway and its members in normal and disease conditions and for developing diagnostics and therapeutic modalities for p53 related pathologies. MARK-modulating agents that act by inhibiting or enhancing MARK expression, directly

or indirectly, for example, by affecting a MARK function such as enzymatic (e.g., catalytic) or binding activity, can be identified using methods provided herein. MARK modulating agents are useful in diagnosis, therapy and pharmaceutical development.</p><p num="p0023">Nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention</p><p num="p0024">Sequences related to MARK nucleic acids and polypeptides that can be used in the invention are disclosed in Genbank (referenced by Genbank identifier (GI) number) as GI#s 9845486 (SEQ ID NO:l), 9845488 (SEQ ID NO:2), 18578044 (SEQ ID NO:3), 14250621 (SEQ ID NO:6), 15042610 (SEQ ID NO:7), 8923921 (SEQ ID NO:8), 17445805 (SEQ ID NO:9), 7959214 (SEQ ID NO: 11), 14042208 (SEQ ID NO: 12), , 3089348 (SEQ ID NO: 13), 4505102 (SEQ ID NO:14), 5714635 (SEQ ID NO:15), 18448970 (SEQ ID NO: 18), 13366083 (SEQ ID NO:19), 14017936 (SEQ ID NO:22), and 16555377 (SEQ ID NO:23) for nucleic acid, and GI#s 9845487 (SEQ ID NO:24), 8923922 (SEQ ID NO:25), 3089349 (SEQ ID NO:26), 4505103 (SEQ ID NO:27), 13366084 (SEQ ID NO:28) and 13899225 (SEQ ID NO:29) for polypeptides.</p><p num="p0025">Additionally, nucleic acid sequences of SEQ TD NOs:4, 5, 16, 17, 20, 21, and novel nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 can also be used in the invention.</p><p num="p0026">MARKs are kinase proteins with kinase and UBA/TS-N domains. The term "MARK polypeptide" refers to a full-length MARK protein or a functionally active fragment or derivative thereof. A "functionally active" MARK fragment or derivative exhibits one or more functional activities associated with a full-length, wild-type MARK protein, such as antigenic or immunogenic activity, enzymatic activity, ability to bind natural cellular substrates, etc. The functional activity of MARK proteins, derivatives and fragments can be assayed by various methods known to one skilled in the art (Current Protocols in Protein Science (1998) Coligan et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Somerset, New</p><p num="p0027">Jersey) and as further discussed below. For purposes herein, functionally active fragments also include those fragments that comprise one or more structural domains of a MARK, such as a kinase domain or a binding domain. Protein domains can be identified using the PFAM program (Bateman A., et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1999, 27:260-2; http ://pfam. wustl.edu) . For example, the proten kinase domains of MARKs from GI#s 9845487 (SEQ ID NO:24), 8923922 (SEQ ID NO:25), 4505103 (SEQ TD NO:27), and 13899225 (SEQ ID NO:29) is located at approximately amino acid residues 20 to 271, 60 to 311, 56 to 307, and 59 to 310, respectively (PFAM 00069). Further, the ubiquitin associated (UBA TS-N) domains of MARKs from GI#s 9845487 (SEQ ID NO:24), 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
8923922 (SEQ ID NO:25), 4505103 (SEQ ED NO:27and 13899225 (SEQ ED NO:29) is located at approximately amino acid residues 291 to 330, 331 to 370, 327 to 366, and 330 to 369, respectively (PFAM 00627). Methods for obtaining MARK polypeptides are also further described below. In some embodiments, preferred fragments are functionally active, domain-containing fragments comprising at least 25 contiguous amino acids, preferably at least 50, more preferably 75, and most preferably at least 100 contiguous amino acids of any one of SEQ ID NOs:24, 25,26,27, 28, or 29 (a MARK). In further preferred embodiments, the fragment comprises the entire kinase (functionally active) domain. The term "MARK nucleic acid" refers to a DNA or RNA molecule that encodes a</p><p num="p0028">MARK polypeptide. Preferably, the MARK polypeptide or nucleic acid or fragment thereof is from a human, but can also be an ortholog, or derivative thereof with at least 70% sequence identity, preferably at least 80%, more preferably 85%, still more preferably 90%, and most preferably at least 95% sequence identity with MARK. Normally, orthologs in different species retain the same function, due to presence of one or more protein motifs and/or 3-dimensional structures. Orthologs are generally identified by sequence homology analysis, such as BLAST analysis, usually using protein bait sequences. Sequences are assigned as a potential ortholog if the best hit sequence from the forward BLAST result retrieves the original query sequence in the reverse BLAST (Huynen MA and Bork P, Proc Natl Acad Sci (1998) 95:5849-5856; Huynen MA et al. , Genome Research (2000) 10:1204-1210). Programs for multiple sequence alignment, such as CLUSTAL (Thompson JD et al, 1994, Nucleic Acids Res 22:4673-4680) may be used to highlight conserved regions andor residues of orthologous proteins and to generate phylogenetic trees. In a phylogenetic tree representing multiple homologous sequences from diverse species (e.g., retrieved through BLAST analysis), orthologous sequences from two species generally appear closest on the tree with respect to all other sequences from these two species. Structural threading or other analysis of protein folding (e.g., using software by ProCeryon, Biosciences, Salzburg, Austria) may also identify potential orthologs. In evolution, when a gene duplication event follows speciation, a single gene in one species, such as Drosophila, may correspond to multiple genes (paralogs) in another, such as human. As used herein, the term "orthologs" encompasses paralogs. As used herein, "percent (%) sequence identity" with respect to a subject sequence, or a specified portion of a subject sequence, is defined as the percentage of nucleotides or amino acids in the candidate derivative sequence identical with the nucleotides or amino acids in the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
subject sequence (or specified portion thereof), after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, as generated by the program WU-BLAST-2.0al9 (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. (1997) 215:403-410; http://blast.wustl.edu blast/README.html) with all the search parameters set to default values. The HSP S and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched. A % identity value is determined by the number of matching identical nucleotides or amino acids divided by the sequence length for which the percent identity is being reported. "Percent (%) amino acid sequence similarity" is determined by doing the same calculation as for determining % amino acid sequence identity, but including conservative amino acid substitutions in addition to identical amino acids in the computation.</p><p num="p0029">A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid having similar properties such that the folding or activity of the protein is not significantly affected. Aromatic amino acids that can be substituted for each other are phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine; interchangeable hydrophobic amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine; interchangeable polar amino acids are glutamine and asparagine; interchangeable basic amino acids are arginine, lysine and histidine; interchangeable acidic amino acids are aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and interchangeable small amino acids are alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine and glycine.</p><p num="p0030">Alternatively, an alignment for nucleic acid sequences is provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2:482-489; database: European Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/MPsrch/; Smith and Waterman, 1981, J. of Molec.BioL, 147: 195- 197; Nicholas et al., 1998, "A Tutorial on Searching Sequence Databases and Sequence Scoring Methods" (www.psc.edu) and references cited therein.; W.R. Pearson, 1991, Genomics 11:635-650). This algorithm can be applied to amino acid sequences by using the scoring matrix developed by Dayhoff (Dayhoff : Atlas of Protein Sequences and Structure, M. O. Dayhoff ed., 5 suppl. 3:353-358, National Biomedical Research</p><p num="p0031">Foundation, Washington, D.C., USA), and normalized by Gribskov (Gribskov 1986 Nucl. Acids Res. 14(6):6745-6763). The Smith- Waterman algorithm may be employed where default parameters are used for scoring (for example, gap open penalty of 12, gap

From the data generated, the "Match" value reflects "sequence identity."</p><p num="p0032">Derivative nucleic acid molecules of the subject nucleic acid molecules include sequences that hybridize to the nucleic acid sequence of any of SEQ TD NOs:l through 23. The stringency of hybridization can be controlled by temperature, ionic strength, pH, and the presence of denaturing agents such as formamide during hybridization and washing. Conditions routinely used are set out in readily available procedure texts {e.g., Current Protocol in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, Chap. 2.10, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Publishers (1994); Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor (1989)). In some embodiments, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention is capable of hybridizing to a nucleic acid molecule containing the nucleotide sequence of any one of SEQ ED NOs:l through 23 under stringent hybridization conditions that comprise: prehybridization of filters containing nucleic acid for 8 hours to overnight at 65° C in a solution comprising 6X single strength citrate (SSC) (IX SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na citrate; pH 7.0), 5X Denhardt's solution, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA; hybridization for 18-20 hours at 65° C in a solution containing 6X SSC, IX Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate; and washing of filters at 65° C for lh in a solution containing 0.2X SSC and 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate). In other embodiments, moderately stringent hybridization conditions are used that comprise: pretreatment of filters containing nucleic acid for 6 h at 40° C in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 5mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA; hybridization for 18-20h at 40° C in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 5mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 10% (wt vol) dextran sulfate; followed by washing twice for 1 hour at 55° C in a solution containing 2X SSC and 0.1% SDS.</p><p num="p0033">Alternatively, low stringency conditions can be used that comprise: incubation for 8 hours to overnight at 37° C in a solution comprising 20% formamide, 5 x SSC, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5X Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 μg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA; hybridization in the same buffer for 18 to 20 hours; and washing of filters in 1 x SSC at about 37° C for 1 hour.

Isolation, Production. Expression, and Mis-expression of MARK Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides</p><p num="p0034">MARK nucleic acids and polypeptides, useful for identifying and testing agents that modulate MARK function and for other applications related to the involvement of MARK in the p53 pathway. MARK nucleic acids and derivatives and orthologs thereof may be obtained using any available method. For instance, techniques for isolating cDNA or genomic DNA sequences of interest by screening DNA libraries or by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are well known in the art. In general, the particular use for the protein will dictate the particulars of expression, production, and purification methods. For instance, production of proteins for use in screening for modulating agents may require methods that preserve specific biological activities of these proteins, whereas production of proteins for antibody generation may require structural integrity of particular epitopes. Expression of proteins to be purified for screening or antibody production may require the addition of specific tags {e.g., generation of fusion proteins). Overexpression of a MARK protein for assays used to assess MARK function, such as involvement in cell cycle regulation or hypoxic response, may require expression in eukaryotic cell lines capable of these cellular activities. Techniques for the expression, production, and purification of proteins are well known in the art; any suitable means therefore may be used (e.g., Higgins SJ and Hames BD (eds.) Protein Expression: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press Inc., New York 1999; Stanbury PF et al., Principles of</p><p num="p0035">Fermentation Technology, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition, Elsevier Science, New York, 1995; Doonan S (ed.) Protein Purification Protocols, Humana Press, New Jersey, 1996; Coligan JE et al, Current Protocols in Protein Science (eds.), 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). In particular embodiments, recombinant MARK is expressed in a cell line known to have defective p53 function (e.g. SAOS-2 osteoblasts, H1299 lung cancer cells, C33A and HT3 cervical cancer cells, HT-29 and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, among others, available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). The recombinant cells are used in cell-based screening assay systems of the invention, as described further below. The nucleotide sequence encoding a MARK polypeptide can be inserted into any appropriate expression vector. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals, including promoter/enhancer element, can derive from the native MARK gene and/or its flanking regions or can be heterologous. A variety of host- vector expression systems may be utilized, such as mammalian cell systems infected with virus {e.g. vaccinia virus, adenovirus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with virus {e.g. baculo virus); 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors, or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA. A host cell strain that modulates the expression of, modifies, and/or specifically processes the gene product may be used.</p><p num="p0036">To detect expression of the MARK gene product, the expression vector can comprise a promoter operably linked to a MARK gene nucleic acid, one or more origins of replication, and, one or more selectable markers {e.g. thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, etc.). Alternatively, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying for the expression of the MARK gene product based on the physical or functional properties of the MARK protein in in vitro assay systems {e.g. immunoassays). The MARK protein, fragment, or derivative may be optionally expressed as a fusion, or chimeric protein product (i.e. it is joined via a peptide bond to a heterologous protein sequence of a different protein), for example to facilitate purification or detection. A chimeric product can be made by ligating the appropriate nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired amino acid sequences to each other using standard methods and expressing the chimeric product. A chimeric product may also be made by protein synthetic techniques, e.g. by use of a peptide synthesizer (Hunkapiller etal., Nature (1984) 310:105-111).</p><p num="p0037">Once a recombinant cell that expresses the MARK gene sequence is identified, the gene product can be isolated and purified using standard methods {e.g. ion exchange, affinity, and gel exclusion chromatography; centrifugation; differential solubility; electrophoresis, cite purification reference). Alternatively, native MARK proteins can be purified from natural sources, by standard methods {e.g. immunoaffinity purification). Once a protein is obtained, it may be quantified and its activity measured by appropriate methods, such as immunoassay, bioassay, or other measurements of physical properties, such as crystallography. The methods of this invention may also use cells that have been engineered for altered expression (mis-expression) of MARK or other genes associated with the p53 pathway. As used herein, mis-expression encompasses ectopic expression, over-expression, under- expression, and non-expression {e.g. by gene knock-out or blocking expression that would otherwise normally occur).</p><p num="p0038">Genetically modified animals</p><p num="p0039">Animal models that have been genetically modified to alter MARK expression may be used in in vivo assays to test for activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent, or to further assess the role of MARK in a p53 pathway process such as apoptosis or cell proliferation.

Preferably, the altered MARK expression results in a detectable phenotype, such as decreased or increased levels of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, or apoptosis compared to control animals having normal MARK expression. The genetically modified animal may additionally have altered p53 expression (e.g. p53 knockout). Preferred genetically modified animals are mammals such as primates, rodents (preferably mice), cows, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs and cats. Preferred non-mammalian species include zebrafish, C. elegans, and Drosophila. Preferred genetically modified animals are transgenic animals having a heterologous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element in a portion of its cells, i.e. mosaic animals (see, for example, techniques described by Jakobovits, 1994, Curr. Biol. 4:761-763.) or stably integrated into its germ line DNA (i.e., in the genomic sequence of most or all of its cells). Heterologous nucleic acid is introduced into the germ line of such transgenic animals by genetic manipulation of, for example, embryos or embryonic stem cells of the host animal.</p><p num="p0040">Methods of making transgenic animals are well-known in the art (for transgenic mice see Brinster et al., Proc.

J. Robertson, ed., IRL Press (1987)). Clones of the nonhuman transgenic animals can be produced according to available methods (see Wilmut, I. et al. (1997) Nature 385:810-813; and PCT International Publication Nos. WO 97/07668 and WO 97/07669).</p><p num="p0042">Ln one embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-out" animal having a heterozygous or homozygous alteration in the sequence of an endogenous MARK gene that results in a decrease of MARK function, preferably such that MARK expression is

undetectable or insignificant. Knock-out animals are typically generated by homologous recombination with a vector comprising a transgene having at least a portion of the gene to be knocked out. Typically a deletion, addition or substitution has been introduced into the transgene to functionally disrupt it. The transgene can be a human gene (e.g., from a human genomic clone) but more preferably is an ortholog of the human gene derived from the transgenic host species. For example, a mouse MARK gene is used to construct a homologous recombination vector suitable for altering an endogenous MARK gene in the mouse genome. Detailed methodologies for homologous recombination in mice are available (see Capecchi, Science (1989) 244:1288-1292; Joyner et al, Nature (1989) 338:153-156). Procedures for the production of non-rodent transgenic mammals and other animals are also available (Houdebine and Chourrout, supra; Pursel et al., Science (1989) 244:1281-1288; Simms et al, Bio/Technology (1988) 6:179-183). In a preferred embodiment, knock-out animals, such as mice harboring a knockout of a specific gene, may be used to produce antibodies against the human counterpart of the gene that has been knocked out (Claesson MH et al., (1994) Scan J Immunol 40:257-264; Declerck PJ et al., (1995) J Biol Chem. 270:8397-400).</p><p num="p0043">In another embodiment, the transgenic animal is a "knock-in" animal having an alteration in its genome that results in altered expression (e.g., increased (including ectopic) or decreased expression) of the MARK gene, e.g., by introduction of additional copies of MARK, or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for altered expression of an endogenous copy of the MARK gene. Such regulatory sequences include inducible, tissue-specific, and constitutive promoters and enhancer elements. The knock-in can be homozygous or heterozygous.</p><p num="p0044">Transgenic nonhuman animals can also be produced that contain selected systems allowing for regulated expression of the transgene. One example of such a system that may be produced is the cre/loxP recombinase system of bacteriophage PI (Lakso et al., PNAS (1992) 89:6232-6236; U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,317). If a cre/loxP recombinase system is used to regulate expression of the transgene, animals containing transgenes encoding both the Cre recombinase and a selected protein are required. Such animals can be provided through the construction of "double" transgenic animals, e.g., by mating two transgenic animals, one containing a transgene encoding a selected protein and the other containing a transgene encoding a recombinase. Another example of a recombinase system is the FLP recombinase system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (O'Gorman et al. (1991) Science 251:1351-1355; U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,182). n a preferred embodiment,

both Cre-LoxP and Flp-Frt are used in the same system to regulate expression of the transgene, and for sequential deletion of vector sequences in the same cell (Sun X et al (2000) Nat Genet 25:83-6).</p><p num="p0045">The genetically modified animals can be used in genetic studies to further elucidate the p53 pathway, as animal models of disease and disorders implicating defective p53 function, and for in vivo testing of candidate therapeutic agents, such as those identified in screens described below. The candidate therapeutic agents are administered to a genetically modified animal having altered MARK function and phenotypic changes are compared with appropriate control animals such as genetically modified animals that receive placebo treatment, and/or animals with unaltered MARK expression that receive candidate therapeutic agent.</p><p num="p0046">In addition to the above-described genetically modified animals having altered MARK function, animal models having defective p53 function (and otherwise normal MARK function), can be used in the methods of the present invention. For example, a p53 knockout mouse can be used to assess, in vivo, the activity of a candidate p53 modulating agent identified in one of the in vitro assays described below. p53 knockout mice are described in the literature (Jacks et al., Nature 2001;410:1111-1116, 1043-1044; Donehower et al, supra). Preferably, the candidate p53 modulating agent when administered to a model system with cells defective in p53 function, produces a detectable phenotypic change in the model system indicating that the p53 function is restored, i.e., the cells exhibit normal cell cycle progression.</p><p num="p0047">Modulating Agents</p><p num="p0048">The invention provides methods to identify agents that interact with and/or modulate the function of MARK and/or the p53 pathway. Such agents are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications associated with the p53 pathway, as well as in further analysis of the MARK protein and its contribution to the p53 pathway.

D (Oxford University Press, Oxford, England), pp. 169-203; Fashema SF et al., Gene (2000) 250:1- 14; Drees BL Curr Opin Chem Biol (1999) 3:64-70; Vidal M and Legrain P Nucleic Acids Res (1999) 27:919-29; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,868). Mass spectrometry is an alternative preferred method for the elucidation of protein complexes (reviewed in, e.g., Pandley A and Mann M, Nature (2000) 405:837-846; Yates JR 3<sup>rd</sup>, Trends Genet (2000) 16:5-8). An MARK-interacting protein may be an exogenous protein, such as a MARK- specific antibody or a T-cell antigen receptor (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988)</p><p num="p0057">Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Harlow and Lane (1999) Using antibodies: a laboratory manual.

In alternative preferred embodiments, a MARK-modulating agent binds a MARK substrate, binding partner, or cofactor.</p><p num="p0058">Antibodies</p><p num="p0059">In another embodiment, the protein modulator is a MARK specific antibody agonist or antagonist. The antibodies have therapeutic and diagnostic utilities, and can be used in screening assays to identify MARK modulators. The antibodies can also be used in dissecting the portions of the MARK pathway responsible for various cellular responses and in the general processing and maturation of the MARK.</p><p num="p0060">Antibodies that specifically bind MARK polypeptides can be generated using known methods. Preferably the antibody is specific to a mammalian ortholog of MARK polypeptide, and more preferably, to human MARK. Antibodies may be polyclonal, monoclonal (mAbs), humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab').sub.2 fragments, fragments produced by a FAb expression horary, anti- idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. Epitopes of MARK which are particularly antigenic can be selected, for example, by routine screening of MARK polypeptides for antigenicity or by applying a theoretical method for selecting antigenic regions of a protein (Hopp and Wood (1981), Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-28; Hopp and Wood, (1983) Mol. Immunol. 20:483-89;</p><p num="p0061">Sutcliffe et al., (1983) Science 219:660-66) to the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ED NOs:24, 25, 26, 27, 28, or 29. Monoclonal antibodies with affinities of 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>1</sup> preferably 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>"1</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, or stronger can be made by standard procedures as described (Harlow and Lane, supra; Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice (2d ed) Academic Press, New York; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,381,292; 4,451,570; and 4,618,577). Antibodies may be generated against crude cell extracts of MARK or substantially purified fragments thereof. If MARK fragments are used, they preferably comprise at least 10, and more preferably, at least 20 contiguous amino acids of a MARK protein. In a particular embodiment, MARK-specific antigens and/or immunogens are coupled to carrier proteins that stimulate the immune response. For example, the subject polypeptides are covalently coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier, and the conjugate is emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, which enhances the immune response. An appropriate immune system such as a laboratory rabbit or mouse is immunized according to conventional protocols. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="18"/>-->
 The presence of MARK-specific antibodies is assayed by an appropriate assay such as a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using immobilized corresponding MARK polypeptides. Other assays, such as radioimmunoassays or fluorescent assays might also be used. Chimeric antibodies specific to MARK polypeptides can be made that contain different portions from different animal species. For instance, a human immunoglobulin constant region may be linked to a variable region of a murine mAb, such that the antibody derives its biological activity from the human antibody, and its binding specificity from the murine fragment. Chimeric antibodies are produced by splicing together genes that encode the appropriate regions from each species (Morrison et al.,</p><p num="p0062">Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1984) 81:6851-6855; Neuberger et al., Nature (1984) 312:604-608; Takeda et al., Nature (1985) 31:452-454). Humanized antibodies, which are a form of chimeric antibodies, can be generated by grafting complementary-determining regions (CDRs) (Carlos, T. M., J. M. Harlan. 1994. Blood 84:2068-2101) of mouse antibodies into a background of human framework regions and constant regions by recombinant DNA technology (Riechmann LM, et al., 1988 Nature 323: 323-327). Humanized antibodies contain ~10% murine sequences and ~90% human sequences, and thus further reduce or eliminate immunogenicity, while retaining the antibody specificities (Co MS, and Queen C. 1991 Nature 351: 501-501; Morrison SL. 1992 Ann. Rev. Immun. 10:239-265). Humanized antibodies and methods of their production are well-known in the art (U.S. Pat.

express the targeted protein (Menard S, et al., Int J. Biol Markers (1989) 4: 131-134). A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, fluorescent emitting lanthanide metals, chemiluminescent moieties, bioluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like (U.S. Pat.

The therapeutically effective dose and dosage regimen is determined by clinical studies. Typically, the amount of antibody administered is in the range of about 0.1 mg/kg -to about 10 mg/kg of patient weight. For parenteral administration, the antibodies are formulated in a unit dosage injectable form (e.g., solution, suspension, emulsion) in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Such vehicles are inherently nontoxic and non- therapeutic. Examples are water, saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin. Nonaqueous vehicles such as fixed oils, ethyl oleate, or liposome carriers may also be used. The vehicle may contain minor amounts of additives, such as buffers and preservatives, which enhance isotonicity and chemical stability or otherwise enhance therapeutic potential. The antibodies' concentrations in such vehicles are typically in the range of about 1 mg/ml to aboutlO mg/ml. Emmunotherapeutic methods are further described in the literature (US Pat.

Preferred nucleic acid modulators interfere with the function of the MARK nucleic acid such as DNA replication, transcription, translocation of the MARK RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the MARK RNA, splicing of the MARK RNA to yield one or more mRNA species, or catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the MARK RNA.

 In one embodiment, the antisense oligomer is an oligonucleotide that is sufficiently complementary to a MARK mRNA to bind to and prevent translation, preferably by binding to the 5' untranslated region. MARK-specific antisense oligonucleotides, preferably range from at least 6 to about 200 nucleotides. In some embodiments the oligonucleotide is preferably at least 10, 15, or 20 nucleotides in length. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide is preferably less than 50, 40, or 30 nucleotides in length. The oligonucleotide can be DNA or RNA or a chimeric mixture or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone. The oligonucleotide may include other appending groups such as peptides, agents that facilitate transport across the cell membrane, hybridization-triggered cleavage agents, and intercalating agents.</p><p num="p0069">In another embodiment, the antisense oligomer is a phosphothioate morpholino oligomer (PMO). PMOs are assembled from four different morpholino subunits, each of which contain one of four genetic bases (A, C, G, or T) linked to a six-membered morpholine ring. Polymers of these subunits are joined by non-ionic phosphodiamidate intersubunit linkages. Details of how to make and use PMOs and other antisense oligomers are well known in the art (e.g. see WO99/18193; Probst JC, Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide and Ribozyme Design, Methods.

 Nucleic acid modulators are commonly used as research reagents, diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite specificity, are often used to elucidate the function of particular genes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,790). Nucleic acid modulators are also used, for example, to distinguish between functions of various members of a biological pathway. For example, antisense oligomers have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals and man and have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials to be safe and effective (Milligan JF, et al, Current Concepts in Antisense Drug Design, J Med Chem. (1993) 36:1923-1937; Tonkinson JL et al, Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides as Clinical Therapeutic Agents, Cancer Invest. (1996) 14:54-65). Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, a MARK-specific nucleic acid modulator is used in an assay to further elucidate the role of the MARK in the p53 pathway, and/or its relationship to other members of the pathway. In another aspect of the invention, a MARK-specific antisense oligomer is used as a therapeutic agent for treatment of p53- related disease states.</p><p num="p0071">Assay Systems</p><p num="p0072">The invention provides assay systems and screening methods for identifying specific modulators of MARK activity. As used herein, an "assay system" encompasses all the components required for performing and analyzing results of an assay that detects and/or measures a particular event. In general, primary assays are used to identify or confirm a modulator's specific biochemical or molecular effect with respect to the MARK nucleic acid or protein. In general, secondary assays further assess the activity of a MARK modulating agent identified by a primary assay and may confirm that the modulating agent affects MARK in a manner relevant to the p53 pathway. In some cases, MARK modulators will be directly tested in a secondary assay.</p><p num="p0073">In a preferred embodiment, the screening method comprises contacting a suitable assay system comprising a MARK polypeptide with a candidate agent under conditions whereby, but for the presence of the agent, the system provides a reference activity (e.g. kinase activity), which is based on the particular molecular event the screening method detects. A statistically significant difference between the agent-biased activity and the reference activity indicates that the candidate agent modulates MARK activity, and hence the ρ53 pathway.

 Primary Assays</p><p num="p0074">The type of modulator tested generally determines the type of primary assay.</p><p num="p0075">Primary assays for small molecule modulators For small molecule modulators, screening assays are used to identify candidate modulators. Screening assays may be cell-based or may use a cell-free system that recreates or retains the relevant biochemical reaction of the target protein (reviewed in Sittampalam GS et al., Curr Opin Chem Biol (1997) 1:384-91 and accompanying references). As used herein the term "cell-based" refers to assays using live cells, dead cells, or a particular cellular fraction, such as a membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondrial fraction. The term "cell free" encompasses assays using substantially purified protein (either endogenous or recombinantly produced), partially purified or crude cellular extracts. Screening assays may detect a variety of molecular events, including protein-DNA interactions, protein-protein interactions {e.g., receptor-ligand binding), transcriptional activity {e.g., using a reporter gene), enzymatic activity (e.g., via a property of the substrate), activity of second messengers, immunogenicty and changes in cellular morphology or other cellular characteristics. Appropriate screening assays may use a wide range of detection methods including fluorescent, radioactive, colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and amperometric methods, to provide a read-out for the particular molecular event detected.</p><p num="p0076">Cell-based screening assays usually require systems for recombinant expression of MARK and any auxiliary proteins demanded by the particular assay. Appropriate methods for generating recombinant proteins produce sufficient quantities of proteins that retain their relevant biological activities and are of sufficient purity to optimize activity and assure assay reproducibility. Yeast two-hybrid and variant screens, and mass spectrometry provide preferred methods for determining protein-protein interactions and elucidation of protein complexes. In certain applications, when MARK-interacting proteins are used in screens to identify small molecule modulators, the binding specificity of the interacting protein to the MARK protein may be assayed by various known methods such as substrate processing (e.g. ability of the candidate MARK-specific binding agents to function as negative effectors in MARK-expressing cells), binding equilibrium constants (usually at least about 10<sup>7</sup>M<sup>"</sup>\ preferably at least about 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>, more preferably at least about 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>"1</sup>), and immunogenicity (e.g. ability to elicit MARK specific antibody

in a heterologous host such as a mouse, rat, goat or rabbit). For enzymes and receptors, binding may be assayed by, respectively, substrate and ligand processing.</p><p num="p0077">The screening assay may measure a candidate agent's ability to specifically bind to or modulate activity of a MARK polypeptide, a fusion protein thereof, or to cells or membranes bearing the polypeptide or fusion protein. The MARK polypeptide can be full length or a fragment thereof that retains functional MARK activity. The MARK polypeptide may be fused to another polypeptide, such as a peptide tag for detection or anchoring, or to another tag. The MARK polypeptide is preferably human MARK, or is an ortholog or derivative thereof as described above. In a preferred embodiment, the screening assay detects candidate agent-based modulation of MARK interaction with a binding target, such as an endogenous or exogenous protein or other substrate that has MARK -specific binding activity, and can be used to assess normal MARK gene function.</p><p num="p0078">Suitable assay formats that may be adapted to screen for MARK modulators are known in the art. Preferred screening assays are high throughput or ultra high throughput and thus provide automated, cost-effective means of screening compound libraries for lead compounds (Fernandes PB, Curr Opin Chem Biol (1998) 2:597-603; Sundberg SA, Curr Opin Biotechnol 2000, 11:47-53). In one preferred embodiment, screening assays uses fluorescence technologies, including fluorescence polarization, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. These systems offer means to monitor protein-protein or DNA-protein interactions in which the intensity of the signal emitted from dye-labeled molecules depends upon their interactions with partner molecules {e.g., Selvin PR, Nat Struct Biol (2000) 7:730-4; Fernandes PB, supra; Hertzberg RP and Pope AJ, Curr Opin Chem Biol (2000) 4:445-451).</p><p num="p0079">A variety of suitable assay systems may be used to identify candidate MARK and p53 pathway modulators (e.g. U.S. Pat.

In some preferred embodiments the screening assay detects the ability of the test agent to modulate the kinase activity of a MARK polypeptide. In further embodiments, a cell-free kinase assay system is used to identify a candidate p53 modulating agent, and a secondary, cell-based assay, such as an apoptosis or hypoxic induction assay (described below), may be used to further characterize the candidate p53 modulating agent. Many different assays for kinases have been reported in the literature 
<!-- EPO <DP n="24"/>-->
and are well known to those skilled in the art (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,992; Zhu et al., Nature Genetics (2000) 26:283-289; and WO0073469). Radioassays, which monitor the transfer of a gamma phosphate are frequently used. For instance, a scintillation assay for p56 (lck) kinase activity monitors the transfer of the gamma phosphate from gamma -<sup>33</sup>P ATP to a biotinylated peptide substrate; the substrate is captured on a streptavidin coated bead that transmits the signal (Beveridge M et al, J Biomol Screen (2000) 5:205-212). This assay uses the scintillation proximity assay (SPA), in which only radio-ligand bound to receptors tethered to the surface of an SPA bead are detected by the scintillant immobilized within it, allowing binding to be measured without separation of bound from free ligand.</p><p num="p0082">Other assays for protein kinase activity may use antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated substrates. For instance, the kinase receptor activation (KIRA) assay measures receptor tyrosine kinase activity by ligand stimulating the intact receptor in cultured cells, then capturing solubilized receptor with specific antibodies and quantifying phosphorylation via phosphotyrosine ELISA (Sadick MD, Dev Biol Stand (1999) 97: 121- 133).</p><p num="p0083">Another example of antibody based assays for protein kinase activity is TRF (time- resolved fluorometry). This method utilizes europium chelate-labeled anti- phosphotyrosine antibodies to detect phosphate transfer to a polymeric substrate coated onto microtiter plate wells.

Assays for apoptosis may be performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin- 11 -dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The TUNEL assay is used to measure nuclear DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis ( Lazebnik et al, 1994, Nature 371, 346), by following the incorporation of fluorescein-dUTP (Yonehara etal, 1989, J. Exp. Med. 169, 1747). Apoptosis may further be assayed by acridine orange staining of tissue culture cells (Lucas, R., et al., 1998, Blood 15:4730-41). An apoptosis assay system may comprise a cell that expresses a MARK, and that optionally has defective p53 function (e.g. p53 is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the apoptosis assay system and changes in induction of apoptosis relative to controls where no test agent is added, identify candidate p53 modulating agents. In some embodiments of the invention, an apoptosis

assay may be used as a secondary assay to test a candidate p53 modulating agents that is initially identified using a cell-free assay system. An apoptosis assay may also be used to test whether MARK function plays a direct role in apoptosis. For example, an apoptosis assay may be performed on cells that over- or under-express MARK relative to wild type cells. Differences in apoptotic response compared to wild type cells suggests that the MARK plays a direct role in the apoptotic response. Apoptosis assays are described further in US Pat. No. 6,133,437.</p><p num="p0085">Cell proliferation and cell cycle assays. Cell proliferation may be assayed via bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) incorporation. This assay identifies a cell population undergoing DNA synthesis by incorporation of BRDU into newly-synthesized DNA. Newly-synthesized DNA may then be detected using an anti-BRDU antibody (Hoshino et al, 1986, Int. J. Cancer 38, 369; Campana et al, 1988, J. Immunol. Mefh. 107, 79), or by other means. Cell Proliferation may also be examined using [ H]-thymidine incorporation (Chen, J.,</p><p num="p0086">1996, Oncogene 13:1395-403; Jeoung, J., 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270:18367-73). This assay allows for quantitative characterization of S-phase DNA syntheses. In this assay, cells synthesizing DNA will incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine into newly synthesized DNA. Incorporation can then be measured by standard techniques such as by counting of radioisotope in a scintillation counter (e.g., Beckman LS 3800 Liquid Scintillation Counter).</p><p num="p0087">Cell proliferation may also be assayed by colony formation in soft agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor (1989)).

Angiogenesis may be assayed using various human endothelial cell systems, such as umbilical vein, coronary artery, or dermal cells. Suitable assays include Alamar Blue based assays (available from Biosource International) to measure proliferation; migration assays using fluorescent molecules, such as the use of Becton Dickinson Falcon HTS FluoroBlock cell culture inserts to measure migration of cells through membranes in presence or absence of angiogenesis enhancer or suppressors; and tubule formation assays based on the formation of tubular structures by endothelial cells on Matrigel® (Becton Dickinson). Accordingly, an angiogenesis assay system may comprise a cell that expresses a MARK, and that optionally has defective p53 function (e.g. p53 is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the angiogenesis assay system and changes in angiogenesis relative to controls where no test agent is added, identify candidate p53 modulating agents.

The alpha subunit of the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HEF-1), is upregulated in tumor cells following exposure to hypoxia in vitro. Under hypoxic conditions, HEF-1 stimulates the expression of genes known to be important in tumour cell survival, such as those encoding glyolytic enzymes and VEGF. Induction of such genes by hypoxic conditions may be assayed by growing cells 
<!-- EPO <DP n="27"/>-->
transfected with MARK in hypoxic conditions (such as with 0.1% 02, 5% CO2, and balance N2, generated in a Napco 7001 incubator (Precision Scientific)) and normoxic conditions, followed by assessment of gene activity or expression by Taqman®. For example, a hypoxic induction assay system may comprise a cell that expresses a MARK, and that optionally has a mutated p53 (e.g. p53 is over-expressed or under-expressed relative to wild-type cells). A test agent can be added to the hypoxic induction assay system and changes in hypoxic response relative to controls where no test agent is added, identify candidate p53 modulating agents. In some embodiments of the invention, the hypoxic induction assay may be used as a secondary assay to test a candidate p53 modulating agents that is initially identified using another assay system. A hypoxic induction assay may also be used to test whether MARK function plays a direct role in the hypoxic response.

Differences in hypoxic response compared to wild type cells suggests that the MARK plays a direct role in hypoxic induction.</p><p num="p0091">Cell adhesion. Cell adhesion assays measure adhesion of cells to purified adhesion proteins, or adhesion of cells to each other, in presence or absence of candidate modulating agents. Cell-protein adhesion assays measure the ability of agents to modulate the adhesion of cells to purified proteins. For example, recombinant proteins are produced, diluted to 2.5g/mL in PBS, and used to coat the wells of a microtiter plate. The wells used for negative control are not coated. Coated wells are then washed, blocked with 1% BSA, and washed again. Compounds are diluted to 2x final test concentration and added to the blocked, coated wells. Cells are then added to the wells, and the unbound cells are washed off. Retained cells are labeled directly on the plate by adding a membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, such as calcein-AM, and the signal is quantified in a fluorescent microplate reader.</p><p num="p0092">Cell-cell adhesion assays measure the ability of agents to modulate binding of cell adhesion proteins with their native ligands. These assays use cells that naturally or recombinantly express the adhesion protein of choice. In an exemplary assay, cells expressing the cell adhesion protein are plated in wells of a multiwell plate. Cells expressing the ligand are labeled with a membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, such as BCECF , and allowed to adhere to the monolayers in the presence of candidate agents.

Unbound cells are washed off, and bound cells are detected using a fluorescence plate reader.</p><p num="p0093">High-throughput cell adhesion assays have also been described. In one such assay, small molecule ligands and peptides are bound to the surface of microscope slides using a microarray spotter, intact cells are then contacted with the slides, and unbound cells are washed off. In this assay, not only the binding specificity of the peptides and modulators against cell lines are determined, but also the functional cell signaling of attached cells using immunofluorescence techniques in situ on the microchip is measured (Falsey JR et al., Bioconjug Chem. 2001 May-Jun;12(3):346-53).</p><p num="p0094">Primary assays for antibody modulators</p><p num="p0095">For antibody modulators, appropriate primary assays test is a binding assay that tests the antibody's affinity to and specificity for the MARK protein. Methods for testing antibody affinity and specificity are well known in the art (Harlow and Lane, 1988, 1999, supra). The enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) is a preferred method for detecting MARK-specific antibodies; others include FACS assays, radioimmunoassays, and fluorescent assays.</p><p num="p0096">Primary assays for nucleic acid modulators For nucleic acid modulators, primary assays may test the ability of the nucleic acid modulator to inhibit or enhance MARK gene expression, preferably mRNA expression. In general, expression analysis comprises comparing MARK expression in like populations of cells {e.g., two pools of cells that endogenously or recombinantly express MARK) in the presence and absence of the nucleic acid modulator. Methods for analyzing mRNA and protein expression are well known in the art. For instance, Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR (e.g., using the TaqMan®, PE Applied Biosystems), or microarray analysis may be used to confirm that MARK mRNA expression is reduced in cells treated with the nucleic acid modulator (e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994) Ausubel FM et al, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chapter 4; Freeman WM et al, Biotechniques (1999) 26:112-125; Kallioniemi OP, Ann Med 2001, 33:142-147; Blohm DH and Guiseppi-Elie, A Curr Opin Biotechnol 2001, 12:41-47). Protein expression may also be monitored. Proteins are most commonly detected with specific antibodies or antisera directed against either the MARK protein or

specific peptides. A variety of means including Western blotting, ELISA, or in situ detection, are available (Harlow E and Lane D, 1988 and 1999, supra).</p><p num="p0097">Secondary Assays Secondary assays may be used to further assess the activity of MARK-modulating agent identified by any of the above methods to confirm that the modulating agent affects MARK in a manner relevant to the p53 pathway. As used herein, MARK-modulating agents encompass candidate clinical compounds or other agents derived from previously identified modulating agent. Secondary assays can also be used to test the activity of a modulating agent on a particular genetic or biochemical pathway or to test the specificity of the modulating agent's interaction with MARK.</p><p num="p0098">Secondary assays generally compare like populations of cells or animals (e.g., two pools of cells or animals that endogenously or recombinantly express MARK) in the presence and absence of the candidate modulator. In general, such assays test whether treatment of cells or animals with a candidate MARK-modulating agent results in changes in the p53 pathway in comparison to untreated (or mock- or placebo-treated) cells or animals. Certain assays use "sensitized genetic backgrounds", which, as used herein, describe cells or animals engineered for altered expression of genes in the p53 or interacting pathways.</p><p num="p0099">Cell-based assays</p><p num="p0100">Cell based assays may use a variety of mammalian cell lines known to have defective p53 function (e.g. SAOS-2 osteoblasts, H1299 lung cancer cells, C33A and HT3 cervical cancer cells, HT-29 and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, among others, available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). Cell based assays may detect endogenous p53 pathway activity or may rely on recombinant expression of p53 pathway components. Any of the aforementioned assays may be used in this cell-based format. Candidate modulators are typically added to the cell media but may also be injected into cells or delivered by any other efficacious means.</p><p num="p0101">Animal Assays</p><p num="p0102">A variety of non-human animal models of normal or defective p53 pathway may be used to test candidate MARK modulators. Models for defective p53 pathway typically use genetically modified animals that have been engineered to mis-express (e.g., over-express

or lack expression in) genes involved in the p53 pathway. Assays generally require systemic delivery of the candidate modulators, such as by oral administration, injection, etc.</p><p num="p0103">In a preferred embodiment, p53 pathway activity is assessed by monitoring neovascularization and angiogenesis. Animal models with defective and normal p53 are used to test the candidate modulator's affect on MARK in Matrigel® assays. Matrigel® is an extract of basement membrane proteins, and is composed primarily of laminin, collagen TV, and heparin sulfate proteoglycan. It is provided as a sterile liquid at 4° C, but rapidly forms a solid gel at 37° C. Liquid Matrigel® is mixed with various angiogenic agents, such as bFGF and VEGF, or with human tumor cells which over-express the MARK. The mixture is then injected subcutaneously(SC) into female athymic nude mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY) to support an intense vascular response. Mice with Matrigel® pellets may be dosed via oral (PO), intraperitoneal (IP), or intravenous (IV) routes with the candidate modulator. Mice are euthanized 5 - 12 days post-injection, and the Matrigel® pellet is harvested for hemoglobin analysis (Sigma plasma hemoglobin kit). Hemoglobin content of the gel is found to correlate the degree of neovascularization in the gel.</p><p num="p0104">In another preferred embodiment, the effect of the candidate modulator on MARK is assessed via tumorigenicity assays. In one example, xenograft human tumors are implanted SC into female athymic mice, 6-7 week old, as single cell suspensions either from a pre-existing tumor or from in vitro culture. The tumors which express the MARK endogenously are injected in the flank, 1 x 10 to l x lO cells per mouse in a volume of 100 μT, using a 27 gauge needle. Mice are then ear tagged and tumors are measured twice weekly. Candidate modulator treatment is initiated on the day the mean tumor weight reaches 100 mg. Candidate modulator is delivered TV, SC, IP, or PO by bolus administration. Depending upon the pharmacokinetics of each unique candidate modulator, dosing can be performed multiple times per day. The tumor weight is assessed by measuring perpendicular diameters with a caliper and calculated by multiplying the measurements of diameters in two dimensions. At the end of the experiment, the excised tumors maybe utilized for biomarker identification or further analyses. For immunohistochemistry staining, xenograft tumors are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,</p><p num="p0105">0.1M phosphate, pH 7.2, for 6 hours at 4°C, immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS, and rapidly frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen.

Diagnostic and therapeutic uses</p><p num="p0106">Specific MARK-modulating agents are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications where disease or disease prognosis is related to defects in the p53 pathway, such as angiogenic, apoptotic, or cell proliferation disorders. Accordingly, the invention also provides methods for modulating the p53 pathway in a cell, preferably a cell pre-determined to have defective p53 function, comprising the step of administering an agent to the cell that specifically modulates MARK activity. Preferably, the modulating agent produces a detectable phenotypic change in the cell indicating that the p53 function is restored, i.e., for example, the cell undergoes normal proliferation or progression through the cell cycle.</p><p num="p0107">The discovery that MARK is implicated in p53 pathway provides for a variety of methods that can be employed for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of diseases and disorders involving defects in the p53 pathway and for the identification of subjects having a predisposition to such diseases and disorders. Various expression analysis methods can be used to diagnose whether MARK expression occurs in a particular sample, including Northern blotting, slot blotting, ribonuclease protection, quantitative RT-PCR, and microarray analysis, (e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994) Ausubel FM et al, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., chapter 4; Freeman WM et al, Biotechniques (1999) 26:112-125; Kallioniemi OP, Ann Med 2001, 33:142-147; Blohm and Guiseppi-Elie, Curr Opin Biotechnol 2001, 12:41-47). Tissues having a disease or disorder implicating defective p53 signaling that express a MARK, are identified as amenable to treatment with a MARK modulating agent. In a preferred application, the p53 defective tissue overexpresses a MARK relative to normal tissue. For example, a Northern blot analysis of mRNA from tumor and normal cell lines, or from tumor and matching normal tissue samples from the same patient, using full or partial MARK cDNA sequences as probes, can determine whether particular tumors express or overexpress MARK. Alternatively, the TaqMan® is used for quantitative RT- PCR analysis of MARK expression in cell lines, normal tissues and tumor samples (PE Applied Biosystems). Various other diagnostic methods may be performed, for example, utilizing reagents such as the MARK oligonucleotides, and antibodies directed against a MARK, as described above for: (1) the detection of the presence of MARK gene mutations, or the detection of either over- or under-expression of MARK mRNA relative to the non- disorder state; (2) the detection of either an over- or an under-abundance of MARK gene

product relative to the non-disorder state; and (3) the detection of perturbations or abnormalities in the signal transduction pathway mediated by MARK.</p><p num="p0108">Thus, in a specific embodiment, the invention is drawn to a method for diagnosing a disease in a patient, the method comprising: a) obtaining a biological sample from the patient; b) contacting the sample with a probe for MARK expression; c) comparing results from step (b) with a control; and d) determining whether step (c) indicates a likelihood of disease. Preferably, the disease is cancer, most preferably a cancer as shown in TABLE 1. The probe may be either DNA or protein, including an antibody.</p><p num="p0109">EXAMPLES</p><p num="p0110">The following experimental section and examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.</p><p num="p0111">I. Drosophila p53 screen The Drosophila p53 gene was overexpressed specifically in the wing using the vestigial margin quadrant enhancer. Increasing quantities of Drosophila p53 (titrated using different strength transgenic inserts in 1 or 2 copies) caused deterioration of normal wing morphology from mild to strong, with phenotypes including disruption of pattern and polarity of wing hairs, shortening and thickening of wing veins, progressive crumpling of the wing and appearance of dark "death" inclusions in wing blade. In a screen designed to identify enhancers and suppressors of Drosophila p53, homozygous females carrying two copies of p53 were crossed to 5663 males carrying random insertions of a piggyBac transposon (Fraser M et al, Virology (1985) 145:356-361). Progeny containing insertions were compared to non-insertion-bearing sibling progeny for enhancement or suppression of the p53 phenotypes. Sequence information surrounding the piggyBac insertion site was used to identify the modifier genes. Modifiers of the wing phenotype were identified as members of the p53 pathway. kp78a was a suppressor of the wing phenotype. Human orthologs of the modifiers are referred to herein as MARK.</p><p num="p0112">BLAST analysis (Altschul et al., supra) was employed to identify Targets from Drosophila modifiers.
