The complex interactions between blood cells, specific plasma proteins and the vascular surface, maintain the fluidity of blood unless injury and blood loss occurs (EP-A-987274). Many significant disease states are related to abnormal haemeostasis. For example, local thrombus formation due to rupture of atheroslerotic plaque is a major cause of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Treatment of an occlusive coronary thrombus by either thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous angioplasty may be accompanied by acute thrombolytic reclosure of the affected vessel. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
There continues to be a need for safe and effective therapeutic anticoagulants to limit or prevent thrombus formation. It is most desirable to develop agents that inhibit coagulation without directly inhibiting thrombin but by inhibiting other steps in the coagulation cascade like factor Xa and/or factor Vila activity. It is now believed that inhibitors of factor Xa carry a lower bleeding risk than thrombin inhibitors (A. E. P. Adang &amp;J. B. M. Rewinkel, Drugs of the Future 2000, 25, 369-383).</p><p num="p0007">Low molecular weight, factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitors that are effective but do not cause unwanted side effects have been described, for example, in WO-A-95/29189. However, besides being an effective factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitor, it is desirable that such inhibitors also have further advantageous properties, for instance stability in plasma and liver and selectivity versus other serine proteases whose inhibition is not intended, such as thrombin. There is an ongoing need for further low molecular weight factor Xa specific blood clotting inhibitors, which are effective and have the above advantages as well.</p><p num="p0008">Specific inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor catalytic complex using monoclonal antibodies (WO-A-92/06711) or a protein such as chloromethyl ketone inactivated factor Vila (WO-A-96/12800, WO-A-97/47651) is an extremely effective means of controlling thrombus formation caused by acute arterial injury or the thrombotic complications related to bacterial septicemia. There is also experimental evidence suggesting that inhibition of factor Vila/tissue factor activity inhibits restenosis following balloon angioplasty. Bleeding studies have been conducted in baboons and indicate that inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor complex has the widest safety window with respect to therapeutic effectiveness and bleeding risk of any anticoagulant approach tested including thrombin, platelet and factor Xa inhibition. Certain inhibitors of factor Vila have already been described. EP-A-987274, for example discloses compounds containing a tripeptide unit, which inhibit factor Vila. However, the property profile of these compounds is still not ideal, and there is an ongoing need for further low molecular weight factor Vila inhibitory blood clotting inhibitors. WO-A-99/33800 discloses indole derivatives, which inhibit factor Xa activity.</p><p num="p0009">The present invention satisfies the above needs by providing novel compounds of the formula I, which exhibit better factor Xa and/or factor Vila inhibitory activity and are favorable agents with high bioavailability.

Further, the term alkyl as used herein expressly includes saturated groups as well as unsaturated groups which latter groups contain one or more, for example one, two or three, double bonds and/or triple bonds, provided that the double bonds are not located within a cyclic alkyl group in such a manner that an aromatic system results. All these statements also apply if an alkyl group occurs as a substituent on another residue, for example in an alkyloxy residue, an alkyloxycarbonyl residue or an arylalkyl residue. Examples of „-(C-]-C<sub>8</sub>)-alkyl" or „-(Cι-C<sub>8</sub>)- alkylene" are alkyl residues containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 carbon atoms are methyl, methylene, ethyl, ethylene. propyl, propylene, butyl, butylene, pentyl, pentylene, hexyl, heptyl or octyl, the n-isomers of all these residues, isopropyl, isobutyl, 1-methylbutyl, isopentyl,

The term „-(Crj-C6)-alkyi" or „-(Crj-C<sub>8</sub>)-alkylene" is a hydrocarbon residues containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 carbon atoms. The term ,,-Cfj-alkyl" or „-</p><p num="p0483">Cn-alkylene" is a covalent bond. Unsaturated alkyl residues are, for example, alkenyl residues such as vinyl, 1-propenyl, 2- propenyl (= allyl), 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, 2-methyI-2-butenyl, 3-methyl-2-butenyl, 5-hexenyI or 1,3-pentadienyl, or alkynyl residues such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl (= propargyl) or 2-butynyl. Alkyl. residues can also be unsaturated when they are substituted. Examples of -(C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>8</sub>)-cycloalkyl cyclic alkyl residues are cycloalkyl residues containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 ring carbon atoms like cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyloheptyl or cyclooctyl, which can also be substituted and/or unsaturated. Unsaturated cyclic alkyl groups and unsaturated cycloalkyl groups like, for example, cyclopentenyl or cyclohexenyl can be bonded via any carbon atom. Of course, a cyclic alkyl group has to contain at least three carbon atoms, and an unsaturated alkyl group has to contain at least two carbon atoms. Thus, a group like (Cι-Cs)-alkyl is to be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic (Cι-Cs)-alkyl, (Cs-CeJ-cycloalkyl, and unsaturated (C<sub>2</sub>-Cs)-alkyl like (C<sub>2</sub>-Cs)-alkenyl or (C<sub>2</sub>-Cs)-alkynyl.

A further route to specifically substituted indole derivatives proceeds via 2,3-dihydroindoles (indolines) which can be easily obtained by reduction of indoles, for example by hydrogenation, or by cyclization of suitable phenylethylamine derivatives. Indolines can- undergo a variety of electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction allowing the introduction of various substituents into the benzene nucleus which cannot directly be introduced by such reactions into the benzene nucleus of the indole molecule.

Starting indole derivatives for the preparation of compounds of the formula I carrying a halogen substituent in the 3-position can also be obtained according to procedures described in the literature like the following. For the fluorination of 1 H-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-position N-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethy!pyridinium triflate is the reagent of choice (T. Umemoto, S. Fukami, G.

Chlorination of 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl esterderivatives in the 3-position by reaction with sulfuryl chloride in benzene yields 3-chloro-1 H-indoIe-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (Chem. Abstr. 1962, 3441 i - 3442b); the same result can obtained by means of NCS (D. Comins, M. Killpack, Tetrahedron Lett. 33 (1989) 4337; M. Brennan, K. Erickson, F. Szmlac, M. Tansey, J. Thornton, Heterocycles 24 (1986) 2879). Bromination of 1H-indole-2- carboxylic acid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-position can be achieved by reaction with NBS (M. Tani, H. Ikegami, M. Tashiro, T. Hiura, H. Tsukioka, Heterocycles 34 (1992) 2349). Analogously to the procedures described above NIS can be used efficiently for the iodination in the of 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-position. Furthermore the iodination of 1 H-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester derivatives in the 3-position the use of iodine is efficient (T. Sakamoto, T. Nagano, Y. Kondo, H. Yamanaka Chem. Pharm. Bull. 36 (1988) 2248).</p><p num="p0524">Especially the groups present in the indole ring system can be modified by a variety of reactions and thus the desired residues R<sup>1a</sup>, R<sup>1b</sup>, R<sup>1c</sup>, R<sup>1d</sup> and R<sup>1e</sup> be obtained.

A reduction of a nitro group may also be carried out at a later stage of the synthesis of a compound of the formula I, and a reduction of a nitro group to an amino group may also occur simultaneously with a reaction performed on another functional group, for example when reacting a group like a cyano group with hydrogen sulfide or when hydrogenating a group. In order to introduce or derive the residues R<sup>1a</sup>"<sup>e</sup>, amino groups can then be modified according to standard procedures for alkylation, for example by reaction with (substituted) alkyl halogenides or by reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, according to standard procedures for acylation, for example by reaction with activated carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid chlorides,

The compound of the formula 15 thus obtained can already contain the desired final groups, i. e. the groups R<sup>8</sup> and R<sup>50</sup> can be the groups -N(R<sup>1</sup>)R<sup>2</sup>-V-G-M and R°-Q- as defined in the formula I,</p><p num="p0533">formula</p><p num="p0534"><img id="imgf000076_0001" orientation="portrait" wi="140" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" file="imgf000076_0001.tif" inline="no" he="35"/>

In the course of the preparation of the compounds of the formula l it can generally be advantageous or necessary to introduce functional groups which reduce or prevent undesired reactions or side reactions in the respective synthesis step, in the form of precursor groups which are later converted into the desired functional groups, or to temporarily block functional groups by a protective group strategy suited to the synthesis problem. Such strategies are well known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, 1991, or P. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Thieme 1994). As examples of precursor groups cyano groups and nitro groups may be mentioned. The cyano group can in a later step be transformed into carboxylic acid derivatives or by reduction into aminomethyl groups, or the nitro groups may be transformed by reduction like catalytic hydrogenation into amino groups. Protective groups can also have the meaning of a solid phase, and cleavage from the solid phase stands for the removal of the protective group. The use of such techniques is known to those skilled in the art (Burgess K (Ed.) Solid Phase Organic Synthesis ,New York: Wiley, 2000). For example, a phenolic hydroxy group can be attached to a trityl-

Similarly, the residues R<sup>1e</sup>, R<sup>1a</sup>, R<sup>1b</sup>, R<sup>1c</sup> and R<sup>1d</sup> in the formulae 14 and 15 have the corresponding definitions of R<sup>7</sup>, R<sup>6</sup>, R<sup>5</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, and R<sup>3</sup> in formula l as defined above, however, for the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I these residues, too, can in principle be present at the stage of the condensation of a compound of the formula 14 with a compound of the formula HR<sup>8</sup>' giving a compound of the formula 15 in the form of precursor groups or in protected form.</p><p num="p0537">The residues R<sup>49</sup> in the compounds of the formula 14 which can be identical or different, can be, for example, hydroxy or (CrC<sub>4</sub>)-alkoxy, i. e., the groups COR<sup>49</sup> present in the compounds of the formula 14 can be, for example, the free carboxylic acids or esters thereof like alkyl esters as can be the groups COR<sup>8</sup> in the compoμnds of the formula I. The groups COR<sup>49</sup> can also be any other activated derivative of a carboxylic acid which allows amide formation, ester formation or thioester formation with a compound of the formula HR<sup>8</sup>'. The group COR<sup>49</sup> can be, for example, an acid chloride, an activated ester like a substituted phenyl ester, an azolide like an imidazolide, an azide or a mixed anhydride, for example a mixed anhydride with a carbonic acid, ester or with a sulfonic acid, which derivatives can all be prepared from the carboxylic acid by standard procedures and can be reacted with an amine, an alcohol or a mercaptan of the formula HR<sup>8</sup>' under standard conditions. A carboxylic acid group COOH representing COR<sup>49</sup> in a compound of the formula 14 can be obtained, for example, from an ester group introduced into the indole system during an indole synthesis by standard hydrolysis procedures. Compounds of the formula I in which a group COR<sup>8</sup> is an ester group can also be prepared from compounds of the formula 14 in which COR<sup>49</sup> is a carboxylic acid group by common esterification reactions like, for example, reacting the acid with an alcohol under acid catalysis, or alkylation of a salt of the carboxylic acid with an electrophile like an alkyl halogenide, or by

transesterification from another ester. Compounds of the formula I in which a group COR<sup>8</sup> is an amide group can be prepared from amines and compounds of the formula 14 in which COR<sup>49</sup> is a carboxylic acid group or an ester thereof by common amination reactions. Especially for the preparation of amides the compounds of the formula 14 in which COR<sup>49</sup> is a carboxylic acid group can be condensed under standard conditions with compounds of the formula HR<sup>8</sup>' which are amines by means of common coupling reagents used in peptide synthesis. Such coupling reagents are, for example, carbodiimides like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiazoles like carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and similar reagents, propylphosphonic anhydride, 0-((cyano-(ethoxycarbonyl)-methylene)amino)-N,N,N',N'- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU), diethylphosphoryl cyanide (DEPC) or bis-(2-oxo-<sup>~</sup> 3-oxazolidinyl)-phosphoryl chloride (BOP-CI) and many others.</p><p num="p0538">If the residue -Q-R<sup>0</sup> present in an indole of the formula I or the residue R<sup>50</sup> present in an indole of the formula 14, or a residue in which functional groups within the residue -Q-R<sup>0</sup> or R<sup>50</sup> are present in protected form or in the form of a precursor group, have not already been introduced during a preceding step, for example during a synthesis of the indole nucleus, these residues can, for example, be introduced into the 1-position of the indole system by conventional literature procedures well known to one skilled in the art for N-alkylation, reductive amination, N-arylation, N-acylation or N-sulfonylation of ring nitrogen atoms of heterocycles. The starting indole derivative that is to be employed in such a reaction carries a hydrogen atom in the 1-position. N-Alkylation of a ring nitrogen atom can, for example, be performed under standard conditions, preferably in the presence of a base, using an alkylating compound of the formula LG-Q-R<sup>0</sup> or of the formula R<sup>50</sup>-LG, wherein the atom in the group Q or in the group R<sup>50</sup> bonded to the group LG in this case is an aliphatic carbon atom of an alkyl moiety and LG is a leaving group, for example halogen like chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a sulfonyloxy group like tosyloxy, mesyloxy or trifluormethylsulfonyloxy. LG may, for example, also be a hydroxy group which, in order to achieve the alkylation reaction, is activated by a conventional activating agent. For the preparation of compounds in which A is a direct linkage and an aromatic group is directly bonded to the 1-position of the indole system, conventional arylation procedures can be used. For example aryl fluorides like alkyl fluorobonzoates or 4- fluorophenyl methyl sulfones can be employed as arylating agents. Such processes are described, for example, By S. Stabler, Jahangir, Synth. Commun. 24 (1994) 123; I. Khanna, R. Weier, Y. Yu, X. Xu. F. Koszyk, J. Med. Chem.40 (1997) 1634. Alternatively a wide variety of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="79"/>-->
substituted aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl triflates can serve as arylating agents at the 1- position of the indole system in a copper salt or palladium mediated reaction according to R. Sarges, H. Howard, K. Koe, A. Weissmann, J. Med. Chem, 32 (1989) 437; P. Unangst, D. Connor, R. Stabler, R. Weikert, J. Heterocycl. Chem, 24 (1987) 811; G. Tokmakov, I.

The activity of the compounds of the formula I can be determined, for example, in the assays described below or in other assays known to those skilled in the art.

For the production of pills, tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, <sub>.</sub> cornstarch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, saline, alcohols, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable carriers for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain about .0.5 % to 90 % by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. The amount of the active ingredient of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 500 mg. In addition to the active ingredients of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or prodrugs and to carrier substances, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain additives such as, for example, fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain two or more compounds of the formula I, and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. In case a pharmaceutical preparation contains two or more compounds of the formula I, the selection of the individual compounds can aim at a specific overall pharmacological profile of the pharmaceutical preparation. For example, a highly potent compound with a shorter duration of action may be combined with a long-acting compound of lower potency. The flexibility permitted with respect to the choice of substituents in the compounds of the formula I allows a great deal of control over the biological and physico- chemical properties of the compounds and thus allows the selection of such desired 
<!-- EPO <DP n="83"/>-->
compounds. Furthermore, in addition to at least one compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically tolerable salt and/or its prodrug, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more other therapeutically or prophylactically active ingredients. When using the compounds of the formula I the dose can vary within wide limits and, as is customary and is known to the physician, is to be suited to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the specific compound employed, on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, on the mode and the schedule of administration, or on whether an acute or chronic condition is treated or whether prophylaxis is carried out. An appropriate dosage can be established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art. In general, the daily dose for achieving the desired results in an adult weighing about 75 kg is from 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, in particular from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, (in each case in mg per kg of body weight). The daily dose can be divided, in particular in the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. As usual, depending on individual behavior it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the daily dose indicated.</p><p num="p0546">A compound of the formula I can also advantageously be used as an anticoagulant outside an individual. For example, an effective amount of a compound of the invention can be contacted with a freshly drawn blood sample to prevent coagulation of the blood sample. Further, a compound of the formula I or its salts can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example in in vitro diagnoses, and as an auxiliary in biochemical investigations. For example, a compound of the formula I can be used in an assay to identify the presence of factor Xa arid/or factor Vila or to isolate factor Xa and/or factor Vila in a substantially purified form. A compound of the invention can be labeled with, for example, a radioisotope, and the labeled compound bound to factor Xa and/or factor Vila is then detected using a routine method useful for detecting the particular label. Thus, a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof can be used as a probe to detect the location or amount of factor Xa and/or factor Vila activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo. Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be used as synthesis intermediates for the preparation of other compounds, in particular of other pharmaceutical active ingredients, which are obtainable from the compounds of the formula I, for example by introduction of substituents or modification of functional groups.</p><p num="p0547">The general synthetic sequences for preparing the compounds useful in the present invention our outlined in the examples given below.

Purified enzymes were used in chromogenic assays. The concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50 % decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by linear regression after plotting the relative rates of hydrolysis (compared to the uninhibited control) versus the log of the concentration of the compound of formula I. For calculating the inhibition constant Ki, the IC50 value was corrected for competition with substrate using the formula</p><p num="p0624">Ki = IC50 / {1 + (substrate concentration / Km)} wherein Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (Chen and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 (1973), 3099-3108; I. H. Segal, Enzyme Kinetics, 1975, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 100-125; which were incorporated herein by reference). a) Factor Xa Assay 
<!-- EPO <DP n="96"/>-->
In the assay for determining the inhibition of factor Xa activity TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05 % (w/v) PEG-8000, 0.02 % (w/v) NaN<sub>3</sub>) was used. The IC50 was determined- by combining in appropriate wells of a Costar half-area microtiter plate 25 μl human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc.; South Bend, Indiana) in TBS-PEG; 40 μl 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG (uninhibited control) or various concentrations of the compound to be tested diluted in 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG; and substrate S-2765 (N(α)-benzyloxycarbonyl- D-Arg-Gly-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide; Kabi Pharmacia, Inc.; Franklin, Ohio) in TBS-PEG. The assay was performed by pre-incubating the compound of formula I plus enzyme for 10 min. Then the assay was initiated by adding substrate to obtain a final volume of 100 μl. The initial velocity of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was measured by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Bio-tek Instruments kinetic plate reader (Ceres UV900HDi) at 25 °C during the linear portion of the time course (usually 1.5 min after addition of substrate). The enzyme concentration was 0.5 nM and substrate concentration was 140 μM. b) Factor Vila Assay The inhibitory activity towards factor VHa/tissue factor activity was determined using a chromogenic assay essentially as described previously 0- A. Ostrem et al., Biochemistry 37 (1998) 1053-1059 which was incorporated herein by reference). Kinetic assays were conducted at 25 °C in half-area microtiter plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts) using a kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectramax 250). A typical assay consisted of 25 μl human factor Vila and TF (5 nM and 10 nM, respective final concentration) combined with 40 μl of inhibitor dilutions in 10% DMSO/TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 % PEG 8000, pH 8.15). Following a 15 minutes preincubation period, the assay was initiated by the addition of 35 μl of the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (D-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Pharmacia Hepar Inc., 500 μM final concentration).
