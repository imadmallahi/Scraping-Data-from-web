The invention additionally concerns novel polymers useful for formulating the disclosed water-based ink compositions.</p><heading>BACKGROUND</heading><p>Concern for the environment as well as increasingly stringent regulation of air quality, pollution and hazardous waste has created a need for alternatives to the use of petroleum and petroleum-based products in ink compositions. The primary focus has been on the development of water- and soy-based printing inks. The major reason for using water-based ink compositions is that because organic solvents are not present except in very small quantities, potential problems such as toxicity, flammability and other hazards are minimized. The major drawback of the currently available water-based inks, however, is their generally poor water fastness, which limits their utility.</p><p>The present invention is addressed to the aforementioned limitation in the art, and provides a water-based ink composition which is also water-fast. That is, the ink compositions are prepared in water, substantially without toxic and/or hazardous organic solvents, but after printing and drying become insoluble in water and many of the common organic solvents as well.</p><p>The novel ink compositions are advantageous in other ways as well. In contrast to many ink compositions of the prior art, the compositions of the invention may be used on a wide variety of substrates, dry quickly after application, and tend not to bleed or smear after drying. In addition, the present ink compositions are generally low in viscosity (and thus relatively easy to work with), display good soak resistance, and have a relatively long shelf life, typically on the order of a year or more.</p><p>Traditional water-based inks are based on resin systems which are dispersed in water. Several references describe inks which are based on aqueous vehicles. U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,417 to Hauser et al., for example, describes low viscosity aqueous printing ink compositions based on polyacrylic resins containing carboxyl groups, and which also contain a humectant, pigment and, optionally, a water-dilutable organic solvent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,245 to Zuraw et al. describes water-based printing inks made with modified rosin grinding resins. U.S. Pat.

The composition comprises components which are soluble in water, or readily rendered soluble in water by addition of a suitable reagent. Accordingly the ink formulation may be prepared in water without need for organic solvents, but is insoluble in water after drying on a substrate.</p><p>The binder material of the ink formulation may comprise a single polymeric material, two or more polymeric materials in combination, a single monomeric material, or two or more monomeric materials in combination, provided that the materials are such that the selected colorant is either ionically or physically entrapped thereby. For example, a first polymeric material bearing negative charges may be used in combination with a second polymeric material bearing positive charges, so as to form a polymeric network in which a colorant having both positive and negative charges is ionically entrapped. Similarly, a first monomeric acidic material, e.g., citric acid or the like, may be used in combination with a second monomeric basic material, e.g., a simple diamine or triamine, so as to form a binder material in the form of a network which, similarly, entraps the colorant either ionically, physically, or both.</p><p>In another embodiment, the invention provides novel polymers useful in the present water-based ink compositions. A first group of these resins, designated herein as Group A, contain hydrophobic segments and ionic segments which are preferably although not necessarily distinct and nonidentical. Group A resins comprise first mer units having the structural formula (I) and second mer units having the structural formula (II) ##STR1## wherein R.sup.1 is a hydrophobic moiety, R.sup.2 is an ionic group, Z.sup.1 and Z.sup.2 are linking moieties, and m and n are independently 0 or 1. These resins may contain additional units having the structural formula (III) ##STR2## where Z.sup.3 provides for intramolecular cross-linking as will be explained below.</p><p>A second group of novel polymers includes resins which are structurally distinguishable from the aforementioned Group A resins, but are similar insofar as they also include hydrophobic segments and ionic segments. For convenience, these novel polymers are termed Group B resins herein, and may be defined as comprising first mer units having the structural formula (IVa) and/or (IVb) and second mer units containing pendant carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid or sulfonic acid groups or sulfonate groups neutralized with ammonia and/or other amine-containing moieties, such second mer units typically having the structural formula (V) ##STR3## In formulae (IVa) and (IVb), R.sup.3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, while R.sup.4a and R.sup.4b are alkyl, with R.sup.4a preferably being lower alkyl. In formula (V), R.sup.5 is an anionic species selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, phosphate and sulfonate, and R.sup.6 is a cationic species, typically a quaternary ammonium moiety, e.g., imidazolyl, NR.sup.7.sub.4.sup.+, or the like, wherein the R.sup.7 moieties may be the same or different and are, for example, hydrogen or lower alkyl. R.sup.6 may be associated with a polymer; for example, it may represent a nitrogen atom in either the backbone of a polymer or a pendant group of a polymer. R.sup.6 may also represent a nitrogen atom in a diamine cross-linking group, such that R.sup.6 provides for linkage to another segment of the resin in an intramolecularly crosslinked network. As with the former group of resins, this group also can include additional mer units having the structural formula (III).</p><p>Group C resins, the third group of novel polymers herein, comprise first mer units having the structure (VI) and second mer units having the structure (VII) and/or (VIIII) ##STR4## wherein, in structure (VII), R.sup.8 represents hydrogen, alkyl of 3 to 16 carbon atoms, or lower acyl --(CO)--R.sup.9 where R.sup.9 is lower alkyl.</p><p>Group D resins, the fourth group of novel polymers herein, have backbones containing a polyethylene glycol moiety and mer units having the structures (IX), (X), (XI) or combinations thereof. ##STR5## In these structures, R.sup.10 is --COOH or --NH.sub.2, x is 0 to 4, and y is 0 or 1. Specific examples of such polymers will be detailed below.</p><p>The resins of Groups A, B, C and D are novel polymers which find utility in a variety of contexts, but have been found to be particularly suitable in conjunction with the preparation of water-based inks, such as those provided herein.</p><p>The ink compositions of the invention provide a number of advantages. Specifically, the novel ink compositions:</p><p>may be prepared in water, but are water-fast once applied to a substrate and allowed to dry;</p><p>are indelible with respect to other liquids as well, including alkaline solutions, detergents, and organic solvents such as alcohols, acetone and toluene;</p><p>may be used on a wide variety of substrates, including cellulosic materials, glass and many types of plastic;</p><p>dry very quickly after application, taking only a few minutes, and tend not to bleed, smear or rub after drying;</p><p>are relatively simple to manufacture;</p><p>display good soak resistance;</p><p>may be readily tailored with respect to variables such as viscosity, surface tension, dielectric constant and color density by varying the amount or type of resin or additives used;</p><p>may also be tailored with respect to end use, i.e., as jet printing inks, pc printing inks, or the like;</p><p>are not flammable;</p><p>are not harmful to the environment; and</p><p>are thermally stable up to temperatures of at least about 150 C.-200</p><p>It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compositions of the invention may provide for other advantages also, depending on the exact choice and relative amounts of the components used as well as on the intended use of the compositions.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Definitions and Nomenclature</p><p>Before the present compounds, compositions and methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.</p><p>It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a resin" includes mixtures of resins, reference to "a polymer" includes mixtures of polymers, reference to "a colorant" includes mixtures of two or more colorants, and the like. Also, it should be noted that reference to "a mer unit" having a particular generic structure includes reference to two or more mer units which may or may not have the same specific structure.</p><p>In this specification and in the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings:</p><p>The term "water-soluble" as used herein to describe the nature of the ink composition prior to drying on a substrate is intended to mean that the composition dissolves virtually completely. Generally, this will mean that the solubility of the composition is at least about 0.5 mg/ml in water.</p><p>The term "water-fast" as used herein to describe the nature of the ink composition after drying on a substrate is intended to mean that the dried composition is insoluble (less than about 1 mg/ml) in water.</p><p>The term "biocompatible" to describe the preferred ink compositions of the invention is used to mean that the components of the compositions do not degrade or otherwise adversely affect biological materials in any significant way.</p><p>The term "organic solvent" is used herein in its conventional sense to refer to a liquid organic compound, typically a monomeric organic material in the form of a liquid, preferably a relatively nonviscous liquid, the molecular structure of which contains hydrogen atoms, carbon atoms, and optionally other atoms as well, and which is capable of dissolving solids, gases or liquids. The present ink formulations are "substantially free" of organic solvents, i.e., they contain less than about 5.0 wt. % organic solvents, more preferably less than about 3.0 wt. % organic solvents, and most preferably are completely free of organic solvents. However, materials classified as organic solvents in this way may be included in the composition in greater quantities if all such solvent present physically interacts with, chemically reacts with, and/or neutralizes the binder material such that it becomes part of the binder/colorant matrix upon drying on a substrate, so that the presence of any such solvent in free, unassociated form is minimal, i.e., within the aforementioned limited ranges.</p><p>The term "entrapped" is used herein to refer to the manner in which colorant is bound by the binder material. The colorant may be ionically associated with the binder material (and thus "ionically entrapped" as the term is used herein), i.e., wherein ionizable or ionized species present on the colorant bind to corresponding species on the binder material. Alternatively, the colorant may be "physically entrapped" by the binder, i.e., physically retained by a matrix, such as a matrix of two or more polymeric materials. In either case, "entrapment" is such that after the ink composition dries on a substrate, leaching of colorant from the binder material does not occur.</p><p>The term "volatile" is used herein to describe certain types of neutralizing agents useful in conjunction with the present ink compositions. The term is used in its conventional sense to refer to a liquid compound which readily vaporizes, has a relatively low boiling point or subliming temperature at atmospheric pressure, and has a relatively high vapor pressure at room temperature. Generally, such compounds will have a boiling point of less than about 20 preferably less than about 0 vapor pressure of at least about 500 kPa and preferably at least about 750 kPa at room temperature. Examples of particularly preferred "volatile" neutralizing agent are ammonia and methylamine. The term "nonvolatile" as used herein to refer to certain other neutralizing agents is intended to mean agents which cannot be classified as "volatile" as just described. Such agents may be liquids or solids. An example of a particularly preferred "nonvolatile" neutralizing agent is imidazole.</p><p>The term "hydrophobic" refers to a tendency not to associate with water. The term is used herein to refer to certain substituents in a relative sense, i.e., by identifying the substituent R.sup.1 as "hydrophobic," it is meant that R.sup.1 is hydrophobic relative to other portions of the molecular structure containing the substituent.</p><p>The term "alkyl" as used herein refers to a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, octyl, decyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl and the like. Preferred alkyl groups herein contain 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The term "lower alkyl" is intended to mean an alkyl group of one to six carbon atoms, preferably one to four carbon atoms.</p><p>The term "alkoxy" as used herein refers to an alkyl group bound through an oxygen atom, e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, or the like. The term "lower alkoxy" is intended to mean an alkoxy group of one to six carbon atoms, preferably one to four carbon atoms.</p><p>The term "alkylene" as used herein refers to a difunctional saturated branched or unbranched hydrocarbon chain containing from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, and includes, for example, methylene (--CH.sub.2 --), ethylene (--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --), propylene (--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --), 2-methylpropylene [--CH.sub.2 --CH(CH.sub.3)--CH.sub.2 --], hexylene [--(CH.sub.2).sub.6 --] and the like. "Lower alkylene" refers to an alkylene group of 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms.</p><p>The term "acyl" is used herein in its conventional sense to refer to an alkyl group bound through a carbonyl moiety, i.e., --(CO)--R where R is alkyl as defined above. The term "lower acyl" is used to refer to an acyl group wherein "R" is lower alkyl.</p><p>"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. For example, the phrase "optionally substituted heterocyclic group" means that a heterocyclic group may or may not be substituted and that the description includes both unsubstituted heterocyclic groups and heterocyclic groups where there is substitution.</p><p>The Novel Ink Compositions</p><p>The aqueous ink compositions of the invention accordingly comprise an aqueous liquid vehicle, an effective amount of a colorant, and a binder material adapted to ionically or physically entrap the colorant. The binder material may be a single polymer, a mixture of two or more polymers, a mixture of a monomer and a polymer, or a mixture of two or more monomers.</p><p>In one embodiment, the binder material is a single polymeric material comprising a resin which is water soluble in its "free" state or which is readily rendered water soluble by admixture with a suitable neutralizing reagent. However, when admixed with water at room temperature, the resin becomes insoluble in water after drying on a substrate. The composition has a pH in the range of approximately 3 to 12.5, preferably in the range of approximately 4 to 9, and most preferably in the range of 5 to 8. Although the ink compositions are primarily useful for ink jet printing, they may be used in a variety of other contexts as well, as will be explained below.</p><p>Generally, in this embodiment, when a single polymeric material is used as the binder material, it is preferred that the polymer be provided with acidic or basic groups, preferably acidic groups, which may be readily neutralized with a suitable neutralizing composition effective to render the polymer water soluble. For example, the polymer may contain carboxylic acid groups which may then be neutralized with a base such as ammonia, a lower alkyl substituted amine, a polymeric amine, a heterocylic amine such as imidazole, or a combination of such reagents. In a particularly preferred embodiment, neutralization of a polymer bearing acidic groups is first conducted with a volatile neutralizing agent effective to produce a solution of approximately 1 to 50 wt. %, more preferably 5 to 30 wt. %, and most preferably 10 to 20 wt. % of the resin in water; examples of such volatile neutralizing agents are ammonia and methylamine. This procedure is then followed by further neutralizing the polymer with a nonvolatile organic base, e.g., imidazole or an alternative amine as described above. The amount and type of nonvolatile organic base is such that the polymer remains in solution upon volatilization of the initial neutralizing agent but which, after the ink composition has been deposited on and allowed to dry on a substrate, does not render the dried deposit soluble when water is applied thereto. Generally, between about 0.01% and 100% and preferably between about 10% to 100% of acidic groups will be neutralized. In some cases, however, neutralization will not be necessary, i.e., when the polymer is water soluble. Further discussion of suitable binder materials is presented in detail hereinbelow.</p><p>The aqueous liquid vehicle will generally be deionized water, although other nonorganic compounds which are either water soluble or water miscible may be included as well. Generally, an inorganic base such as ammonia or an organic amine (e.g., a lower alkyl amine) is added to bring the pH into the desired range. Where a neutralizing composition is used comprising such a reagent, the composition serves a dual purpose, i.e., to render the binder material water soluble and to adjust the pH of the ink composition upward.</p><p>The colorant may be any pigment, dye or stain which may be dissolved, dispersed or suspended in the aqueous liquid vehicle and which is effective to provide the dried ink with the desired color and color intensity. Colorants which tend to be immobilized on the selected resin, e.g., through covalent or ionic attachment, are preferred. Such colorants include azo or "direct" dyes as well as dyes containing acidic groups (e.g., carboxylate, phosphonate or sulfonate moieties), basic groups (e.g., amine salts), or both. In any case, the colorant and the binder material should be selected so that in combination, the colorant becomes entrapped by the binder.</p><p>Specific examples of suitable colorants include: Dispersol Blue Grains (Zeneca, Inc.), Duasyn Acid Blue (Hoechst Celanese), Duasyn Direct Turquoise Blue (Hoechst Celanese), Phthalocyanine blue (C.I. 74160), Diane blue (C.I. 21180), Pro-jet Cyan 1 (Zeneca, Inc.). Milori blue (an inorganic pigment equivalent to ultramarine) as cyan colorants; Dispersol Red D-B Grains (Zeneca, Inc.), Brilliant carmine 6B (C.I. 15850), Pro-jet magenta (Zeneca, Inc.), Brilliant Red F3B-SF (Hoechst Celanese), Red 3B-SF (Hoechst Celanese), Acid Rhodamine (Hoechst Celanese), Quinacridone magenta (C.I. Pigment Red 122) and Thioindigo magenta (C.I. 73310) as magenta colorants; Dispersol Yellow D-7G 200 Grains (Zeneca, Inc.), Brilliant yellow (Hoechst Celanese), Pro-jet yellow 1 (Zeneca, Inc.), benzidine yellow (C.I. 21090 and C.I. 21100) and Hansa Yellow (C.I. 11680) as yellow colorants; organic dyes; and black materials such as carbon black, charcoal and other forms of finely divided carbon, iron oxide, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and the like. Specific and preferred black colorants include Acid Black 48 (Aldrich), Direct Black 58756 A (Crompton &amp; Knowles), BPI Molecular Catalytic Gray (Brain Power), Fasday Cool Gray (Hunter Delator), Dispersol Navy XF Grains (Zeneca, Inc.), Dispersol Black CR-N Grains (Zeneca, Inc.), Dispersol Black XF Grains (Zeneca, Inc.), Hostafine Black TS (Hoechst Celanese), Hostafine Black T (Hoechst Celanese), Duasyn Direct Black (Zeneca), Pro-jet Black 1 (Zeneca, Inc.) and Pro-jet Fast Black 2 (Zeneca, Inc.).</p><p>Generally, it is preferred that the colorant be present in an amount ranging from about 0.1 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the ink composition, more preferably from about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of the ink composition, and most preferably from about 1 wt. % to about 5 wt. % of the ink composition.</p><p>The binder material, in a first embodiment, comprises a single polymeric material. The material may be any one of the above-mentioned polymers in Groups A, B, C or D, which will be described in further detail in the following section, or it may be a known resin which functions in an equivalent manner, i.e., to entrap the colorant, either physically or through ionic interaction. Any such resin, also, should be selected such that it is soluble in water or readily rendered soluble in water by addition of a suitable neutralizing agent, but is water-fast after being applied to a substrate and allowed to dry. Preferably, the resin is also selected such that it is biocompatible.</p><p>Commercially available polymeric materials which may be used include, but are not limited to, polyethyleneimine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyoxazoline, polyvinylpyridine, polyallylamine (including N-alkylated and N,N-dialkylated polyallylamines), polyvinylaziridine, polyimidazole, polylysine, alginic acid, chitin, chitosan, poly(amino and alkylated amino)ethylenes and ethoxylated polyethyleneimine.</p><p>In general, the molecular weight of any polymeric material used in the present ink formulations will be between about 300 and 150,000, and preferably between about 300 and 100,000, although smaller and larger molecular species may be used depending on the application.</p><p>As explained above, the binder material can comprise not only a single polymeric material but also a mixture of two or more polymeric materials, preferably although not necessarily Group A, B, C or D resins, so as to produce an interpolymer matrix. The only requirement here with respect to the polymers selected and the relative quantities used is that ionic or physical entrapment of colorant be such that colorant leaching is precluded. In a preferred embodiment, when a mixture of polymeric materials is used, one polymer has acidic groups, e.g., carboxylic acid groups, and a second polymer has basic groups, e.g., ionized amine moieties. Examples of suitable combinations include, for example, polyethyleneimine, N-alkylated polyethyleneimine, polyimidazole or polyvinylpyridine in combination with an acrylate copolymer such as acrylamide acrylic acid, acrylonitrile acrylic acid, styrene acrylic acid, or the like.</p><p>In another embodiment, the binder material comprises a mixture of monomeric species which in combination act to ionically or physically entrap the colorant. In such a case, a first monomeric species is used which is acidic, and a second monomeric species is used which is basic. Again, the only limitation on the particular species selected is that the combination provide for complete entrapment of colorant such that there is no leaching after the ink has been applied to and allowed to dry upon a substrate. Preferred acidic materials in this embodiment contain two or more acidic groups, e.g., citric acid, tartaric acid, glutaric acid, gluconic acid, and benzene tetracarboxylic acid. Monoacids may be used, but should be combined with di- or polyacids. Similarly, preferred basic materials in this embodiment contain two or more basic groups, e.g., diamines, polyamines and the like. Examples of particularly preferred bases include hexamethylene tetraamine, triethylene tetraamine, ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, tetraethylene pentamine, pentaethylene hexamine, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine, 1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylene tetramine and N-alkylated as well as N,N-dialkylated substituted amines. If desired, combinations of acids may be used, as may combinations of bases.</p><p>Finally, a single polymeric material may be used in conjunction with a single monomeric material, again, with the materials selected such that the two components are together capable of providing a matrix which entraps the colorant. When the polymer contains acidic groups, the monomeric material will contain basic groups, and vice versa. The polymer can be any one of the resins of Groups A through D, or it may be a functionally equivalent material.</p><p>The ink compositions of the invention may contain other components as well. A preferred additive is urea or an alkyl-substituted urea, which may be substituted for one or more of the above-mentioned bases, or it may be used in conjunction therewith. Additionally, it may be preferable in some cases to include a humectant. Suitable humectants include, for example, triacetin, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and glycerol. It may also be preferable to include anti-foaming agents with certain compositions; examples of suitable anti-foaming agents include 1-dodecyl alcohol, Silicon Antifoam 85390 (Fluka), Surfynol DF75 (Air Products), Surfynol DF210 (Air Products), Carboflow 32W (B. F. Goodrich), Tego Airex 900 (TegoChemie USA), TegoFoamex 1488 (TegoChemie USA), Siliconantifoamer S670 (Wacker) and Foam Blast 338 (Ross Chemicals). Other additives include viscosity modifiers, surface tension control agents such as anionic and nonionic surface active agents, preservatives and biocides. It may also be desirable in some cases to include cross-linking agents such as imidazole, substituted imidazoles, polyethyleneimines, polyvinylimidazole, polyvinylpyridine, and polyaminosiloxanes. Finally, it may also be preferred in some cases to include polyethylene glycol (PEG) when the composition is formulated for jet printing. Incorporation of PEG in the present ink formulations lowers surface tension, improves water fastness, and reduces the likelihood that the ink will dry on the jet printing nozzle. When PEG is included in the ink formulation, it should represent on the order of 0.1 to 20 wt. % of the formulation, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt. % of the formulation, and most preferably approximately 6.0 wt. %.</p><p>However, even though the ink composition may contain these additional components, it is strongly preferred that for jet printing inks, the binder, colorant and water that are present should in combination represent at least about 90 wt. % of the composition. Also, the composition may contain very small amounts of monomeric organic solvents, e.g., lower alcohols or the like. Any such solvents should be present in an amount that is less than about 5 wt. %, preferably less than about 3 wt. %, of the ink composition. However, if a monomeric solvent is included in the composition which physically interacts or chemically reacts with the binder material so as to form part of the binder/colorant matrix which forms the substance of the dried ink composition, somewhat more solvent may be included.</p><p>Novel Polymeric Structures</p><p>As noted above, a number of polymers useful in conjunction with the present ink compositions are new. The polymers of Groups A and B, as defined above, contain hydrophobic segments and ionic segments which are typically although not necessarily distinct and nonidentical.</p><p>With regard to Group A resins, such polymers contain first mer units having the structural formula (I) and second mer units having the structural formula (II), wherein R.sup.1, R.sup.2, Z.sup.1, Z.sup.2, m and n are as defined earlier herein. ##STR6##</p><p>Preferably, R.sup.1 is a hydrophobic moiety selected from the group consisting of: cyano; lower alkyl esters; unsubstituted monocyclic five- and six-carbon aromatic moieties; monocyclic five- and six-carbon aromatic moieties substituted with 1 to 4 substituents selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen and nitro; unsubstituted monocyclic five- and six-carbon heterocyclic moieties containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms; and monocyclic five- and six-carbon heterocyclic moieties containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms and 1 to 4 substituents selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen and nitro. Examples of particularly preferred groups suitable as R.sup.1 include imidazolyl and pyrrolidinyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, e.g., carboxylate-, sulfonate- or phosphate-substituted lower alkylene groups, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or the like.</p><p>R.sup.2 represents a salt moiety --W.sup.+ X.sup.-  or Y.sup.- Z.sup.+  or a zwitterionic species --A.sup.+ --L.sup.1 --B.sup.-  or --C.sup.- --L.sup.2 --D.sup.+  wherein W, Z, A and D are independently either imidazolyl or a quaternary ammonium moiety optionally substituted with alkyl groups, preferably lower alkyl groups, and further wherein Z may be a metallic cation such as sodium, lithium, or the like, X, Y, B and C are selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, phosphate and sulfonate, and L.sup.1 and L.sup.2 are alkylene linking moieties. Examples of ionic species include, for example, --COO.sup.- Z.sup.+, --P(O)O.sub.2.sup.2- Z.sup.2+, --SO.sub.3.sup.- Z.sup.+, --NH.sub.4.sup.+ X.sup.-, --CH.sub.2 --NR.sub.3.sup.+ X.sup.-, and ##STR7## where R is generally hydrogen or lower alkyl, while zwitterionic species include, for example, ##STR8## The linking groups Z.sup.1 and Z.sup.2 are optional, as may be deduced from the definition of the subscripts "m" and "n," i.e., they may be zero or one. If present, Z.sup.1 and Z.sup.2 are independently selected from the group consisting of arylene, optionally containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms, C.sub.6 -C.sub.18 aralkylene, C.sub.1 -C.sub.12 alkylene, --CO--, --COO--, --CONH-- and --NHCO--. Lower alkylene and amide linkages are particularly preferred.</p><p>Such resins may contain two or more different structural units encompassed by the genus of formula (I), and/or two or more different structural units encompassed by the genus of formula (II). The resins may also include additional vinyl-based mer units having the structural formula (III) ##STR9## wherein Z.sup.3 is a cross-linking moiety promoting intramolecular cross-linking of the resin, such that it is bound to another vinyl unit within the same resinous species. Z.sup.3 may be a siloxane or polysiloxane moiety, a silazane or polysilazane moiety, or a diamine --NR--Z.sup.4 --NR-- where, as before, R is hydrogen or lower alkyl and Z.sup.4 is an optional linking moiety, typically lower alkylene.</p><p>Examples of specific such resins include the following: ##STR10##</p><p>A second group of novel polymers (Group B) again, contain first mer units having the structural formula (IVa) and/or (IVb) and second mer units containing pendant carboxyl, phosphate and/or sulfonate groups (exemplified by structure (V)). The acidic groups present in these latter mer units are preferably neutralized as described above so as to provide the substituent R.sup.6 ; that is, neutralization is carried out using ammonia and/or an amine such as a lower alkyl amine (mono-, di- or trisubstituted), a diamine of the formula H.sub.2 N--R.sup.8 --NH.sub.2 where R.sup.8 is lower alkylene or arylene, a monomeric polyamine, a polymeric amine or imine (e.g., polyethyleneimine), a heterocyclic amine such as imidazole, or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. Examples of particularly suitable amines include imidazole, 4,4'-bipyridyl, tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, tetramethylethylenediamine and triethylenetetraamine.</p><p>For example, the polymers of Group B may be treated as described in the preceding section with respect to acidic binding materials in general, i.e., they may be neutralized initially with a volatile base such as ammonia so as to render ionic a fraction of the carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid and/or sulfonic acid groups, followed by further neutralization with a nonvolatile organic base, e.g., a lower alkyl substituted amine, a diamine, a mono-, di- or triethanolamine, a polymeric amine or imine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine, or other heterocyclic amines such as imidazole. Again, between about 0.01% and 100% and preferably between about 10% to 100% of the pendant carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid and/or sulfonic acid groups may be neutralized in this manner, with the desired fraction of neutralized acidic groups, as noted above, dependent on the polymer and its solubility in water. With polymers that are more water soluble, fewer acidic groups need to be neutralized, while with polymers that are less soluble in water, more acidic groups will need to be neutralized. In each case, however, neutralization of Group B resins must be carried out to an extent sufficient to render the polymer substantially water soluble.</p><p>With mer units having the structural formula (IVb), a similar neutralization technique may be used using a carboxylic acid (i.e., to increase the water solubility of the polymer), a dicarboxylic acid (for the same reason, as well as to provide cross-linking) such as adipic or succinic acids, or a polyacid. Examples of suitable acids include oxalic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, dihydroxyfumaric acid, succinic acid, glutamic acid, adipic acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, 1,2- and 1,3-cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, 1,2,3-, 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid, tricarballylic acid, 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylic acid, norbornene tetracarboxylic acid, 3,3'4,4'-benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4,5,6-benzene hexacarboxylic acid, a-amino acids such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and the like. Any one of these acids may also be substituted, e.g., with one or more alkyl, typically lower alkyl, groups, or they may be converted to anhydride form.</p><p>As with Group A resins, polymers of Group B may contain two or more different structural units of the first type and two or more different structural units of the second type.</p><p>In the mer units of formula (IVa) and (IVb), R.sup.3, as noted above, is either hydrogen or lower alkyl, while R.sup.4a and R.sup.4b preferably being lower alkyl. In the commercially available material sold under the trademark Carboset</p><p>In the mer units of formula (V), R.sup.5 is carboxylate, phosphate or sulfonate, although carboxylate is preferred. R.sup.6 is a cationic counterion associated with R.sup.5, and is preferably a quaternary ammonium moiety, e.g., imidazolyl, pyrrolidinyl, NR.sup.7.sub.4.sup.+, wherein R.sup.7 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, or R.sup.6 may represent a nitrogen atom in a polymer such as polyethyleneimine, or a nitrogen atom in a diamine cross-linking group, such that R.sup.6 provides for linkage to another segment of the resin in an intramolecularly crosslinked network.</p><p>Still other polymers useful for formulating the present ink compositions are those of Groups C and D. Group C polymers comprise first mer units having the structure (VI) --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --NH-- and second mer units having the structure (VII) --CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --NR.sup.8 -- or (VIII) --CH.sub.2 --CH(COOH)--, wherein, in structure (VII), R.sup.8 represents hydrogen, alkyl of 3 to 16 carbon atoms, or lower acyl --(CO)--R.sup.9 where R.sup.9 is lower alkyl. Examples of such polymers are thus the following: ##STR11##</p><p>Group D polymers have backbones containing a polyethylene glycol moiety and mer units having the structures (IX), (X), (XI) or combinations thereof. ##STR12## In these structures, R.sup.10 is --COOH or --NH.sub.2, x is 0 to 4, and y is 0 or 1. Particularly preferred polymers within this group are those derived from polyethylene glycols and an amino acid such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine or 4-hydroxyproline. Examples of such polymers are as follows: ##STR13##</p><p>The polymers of Groups C and D, when containing acidic groups, are preferably neutralized as described previously, e.g., initially using a volatile neutralizing agent such as ammonia and subsequently with a nonvolatile organic base such as imidazole or the like. As above, a particularly preferred embodiment involves partial neutralization of the selected polymer's pendant acidic groups, followed by further neutralization with a heterocyclic amine such as imidazole, with the relative amounts of polymer, ammonia and heterocyclic amine selected to provide the desired water solubility of the polymer.</p><p>For the present purpose, it should be emphasized that these novel polymers are particularly useful in conjunction with the inventive ink formulations. However, it will be appreciated that some or all of these polymers may have other utility as well, e.g., in biomaterials or the like.</p><p>The novel polymers may be synthesized from monomeric starting materials or they may be prepared by chemically modifying commercially available products, using techniques well known or readily available to those skilled in the art of polymer chemistry. Typically, to prepare Group A and Group B polymers, modification of standard, commercially available polymers will take the form of treating the polymer so that it then contains both hydrophobic and ionic portions. For example, commercially available resins which contain pendant carboxyl groups may be modified so that a fraction of those groups are ionic and associated with hydrophobic counterions, e.g., imidazolium ions or quaternary ammonium salts. Examples of commercially available resins which may be modified in this way include the following acrylate-based polymers: Aqua-hyde Inc.); Surcol Inc.); Neocryl Goodrich); and Joncryl generally between about 0.01% and 100% and preferably between about 10% to 100% of the pendant carboxyl groups in such polymers may be rendered ionic in this manner.</p><p>Group C polymers containing mer units (VI) and (VII) can generally be prepared by treating polyethyleneimine with any one of a variety of alkyl and/or aryl halides, typically C.sub.2 -C.sub.16 alkyl and/or aryl halides, in a solvent such as methanol, dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, or the like. Polymers containing mer units (VI) and (VIII) can be prepared by copolymerization of aziridine and methyl acrylate under acidic conditions, followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the acrylate group.</p><p>Group D polymers are generally prepared by first activating an a-amino-protected diacid with N-hydroxysuccinimide to provide an activated ester, e.g., of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or the like, and then reacting the activated ester with polyethylene glycol, and hydrolyzing the resulting product.</p><p>Methods of Manufacture and Use</p><p>The aforementioned ink compositions may be prepared in any number of ways, as will be appreciated by those working in the field of printing ink chemistry and ink manufacturing technology. A preferred method for formulating the ink compositions, however, involves first dispersing the selected colorant in deionized water (or obtaining a predispersed colorant/water admixture), followed by admixture with a solution of the selected binder material(s) in water, in turn followed by incorporation of additives such as humectant, anti-foaming agent, and the like, and any species necessary for purposes of neutralization, e.g., an amine such as ammonia and/or imidazole when an acidic resin is used. This admixture is then stirred and mixed in either a fine ball mill or an emulsifier mixer, and filtered to achieve a particle size of less than about 5 μm, preferably less than about 1 μm, in diameter.</p><p>The ink compositions of the invention may be used as jet printing inks, flexographic inks, lithographic inks, screen printing inks, or the like. Depending on the desired utility, the viscosity of the ink composition will need to be adjusted. For example, the preferred viscosity for a jet printing ink is in the range of approximately 1.5 to 15 cP, more preferably in the range of approximately 1.5 to 10 cP, and most preferably in the range of approximately 3 to 5 cP, while the preferred viscosity for a screen printing ink is in the range of approximately 100 to 400 cP, more preferably in the range of about 200 to 300 cP.</p><p>When tailored for use with pc printers, the present ink composition need not be limited with respect to sonic velocity or resistivity. However, viscosity considerations are somewhat different than for other end uses, insofar as lower viscosities are generally preferred for pc printing, typically less than about 2.5 cP, preferably less than about 2.0 cP, and most preferably in the range of about 1.5 to 2.0 cP. It is generally desirable that when formulating the compositions for pc printers, the binder material should comprise a mixture of two monomeric materials, preferably a di- or polyacid in combination with a di- or polyamine, as discussed hereinabove. Also, any components selected for use in pc printing ink compositions should be thermally stable, as they are subjected to higher temperatures, in general, than other types of inks. Finally, pc printing inks may involve a different pH range than other types of ink compositions, and should be chloride-free to avoid corrosion.</p><p>As explained in U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,417 to Hauser et al., viscosity may be adjusted using any known substances so long as those materials do not adversely affect the ink composition and the substrate on which the composition is ultimately applied. Suitable viscosity control agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxylpropyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, water soluble acrylic resins and polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p><p>The ink compositions of the invention are not intended to be limited to use on particular substrates. The present compositions are in fact quite versatile insofar as they may be used on paper, plastic, metal, ceramics, and the like. In some cases, for example with a number of plastic materials, it may be necessary to pretreat the surface on which the ink is to be applied so that it is rendered hydrophilic, i.e., such that carboxyl or other ionized groups are provided thereon.</p><p>Experimental</p><p>The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of synthetic organic chemistry, polymerization, ink manufacture, and the like, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.
