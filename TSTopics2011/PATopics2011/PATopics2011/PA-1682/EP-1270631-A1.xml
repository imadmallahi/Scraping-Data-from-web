give cured rubbers suitable to prepare manufactured articles,
in particular O-ring and gaskets, capable to maintain
elastomeric properties at very low temperatures, also of
-60°C, preferably of -70°C, having improved mechanical properties,
in particular high hardness, also higher than 70 Shore
A, preferably higher than 80 Shore A, combined with improved
chemical resistance and to solvents (lower swelling) and
having the characteristic to be processable with the rubber
processing technologies in open or closed mixers.</p><p num="0002">It is known that hydrogenated elastomers cannot be used
to prepare the above gaskets due to the high swelling to
solvents, for example hydrocarbons.</p><p num="0003">Fluorinated rubbers are also known, for example Tecnoflon®,
which shows an excellent chemical resistance and to
solvents, excellent sealing properties, but they have the
drawback not to be usable at low temperatures, for example
lower than -20°C ÷ -30°C.</p><p num="0004">Rubbers containing perfluoropolyether blocks are known
which have excellent elastomeric properties at low temperature 
and chemical resistance and to solvents, but they have the
drawback to have a poor hardness, generally lower than 70
Shore A. Furthermore said rubbers have the drawback not to be
processable with the conventional rubber technologies (open or
closed mixers). For this purpose see USP 5,837,774 which
describes curable rubbers containing PFPEs and having terminal
unsaturations of olefinic type. They are cured by hydrosilylation
with polysilanes and Pt catalysts. As said, the above
cured rubbers do not show a hardness higher than 70 Shore A.
Besides the used catalysts are very expensive and easily
poisonable, and therefore a specific equipment is required for
obtaining said crosslinkable elastomers, which is not
accessible to the most of the elastomer substances
transformers.

USP 6,020,450 describes polymers based on PFPEs and siloxanes,
having alkoxysilane chain end groups. Said polymers can be
used to prepare elastomers, or as release agents in silicone
formulations. Also in this case the cured products show a low
hardness. Besides above polymers are not suitable to prepare
blends with conventional rubbers, such as EPDM, since they do
not cure with the curing agents of the hydrogenated rubbers.</p><p num="0005">PFPE-based polyurethanes are also known. They however
have the drawback that the crosslinking process is very quick.
In fact after few seconds the viscosity of the prepolymer 
under reaction becomes very high, whereby it is practically
not possible to compound said polymers with fillers and
additives. Therefore it is not possible to modulate the
mechanical properties of a predetermined basis composition. In
order to modulate said properties it is necessary to change
the monomeric composition of the polymer. This is a drawback
from the industrial point of view since it requires frequent
changements of the basis polymer production with consequent
increase of costs. See for example EP 359,273 and USP
4,782,130 which describe linear or crosslinked polyurethanes
having elastomeric properties, obtained starting from
(per)fluoropolyether diols. The crosslinked structures are
obtained by adding to the fluorinated prepolymer, obtained by
reacting the PFPE diol with polyisocyanates, compounds having
a low molecular weight, both aliphatic and aromatic, suitably
functionalized, such for example triols, tetraols or
triamines, or alternatively isocyanate trimers. Besides said
polyurethanes are obtainable only by casting, by adding the
crosslinking agent immediately before the casting in the
mould. Therefore the manufactured article in this case can be
prepared only during the elastomer synthesis. The rubber
cannot be processed in conventional rubber equipments, such,
as said, mixers.</p><p num="0006">Fluorinated thermoprocessable elastomers containing 
(per)fluoropolyether sequences, obtainable by
polycondensation, are known in the prior art. See EP 621,298.
The obtained elastomers show an improved flexibility at low
temperature, but they have the drawback to have a very low
chemical resistance and to solvents.</p><p num="0007">USP 5,204,441 describes polyurethane elastomers containing
branched perfluoroalkyl groups. The polyurethanes
obtained according to said patent show improved processability,
however these polyurethanes are not usable at low
temperatures.</p><p num="0008">The need was felt to have available elastomers allowing
to overcome the above drawbacks of the fluorinated
polyurethanes of the prior art, and having therefore the combination
of the above properties.</p><p num="0009">The Applicant has surprisingly and unexpectedly found
crosslinkable elastomeric polymers capable to solve the above
technical problem.</p><p num="0010">An object of the present invention are curable (per)fluoropolyether

semicrystalline fluoropolymers, i.e. a polymer having at least
a glass transition temperature and a melting temperature,
preferably said semicrystalline fluoropolymers are selected
from PTFE and modified PTFEs.</p><p num="0030">Preferably the compound has the following composition,

wherein the amounts of components (expressed in phr per 100
parts by weight of crosslinkable elastomer) are:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>curing agent: from 0.1 to 6;</li><li>filler: from 0 to 50, preferably from 10 to 40;</li><li>crosslinking coagent: from 0 to 5.</li></ul></p><p num="0031">Other additives can be added to the compound: for example
antiflame, antioxidant, antifoam, antistatic agents and, generally
the additives used in rubbers.</p><p num="0032">The curing compound is obtained by mixing the various
components in the mixer using the conventional rubber
tecnologies. For example the mixer can be an open, cylinder or
closed (Banbury) type.</p><p num="0033">After having obtained from the compound the cured
manufactured article, a treatment at temperatures in the range
100° and 135°C can optionally be carried out to remove the
optional residual peroxide. </p><p num="0034">The cured manufactured articles, as said obtainable from
the crosslinkable polymers of the invention, are usable as
gaskets for low temperatures with good elastomeric properties,
also at temperatures lower than -60°C, preferably lower
than -70°C and a Shore A hardness higher than 70. Furthermore
said crosslinkable polymers are processable with the
conventional rubber technologies in open or closed mixers
and have an improved chemical resistance and to solvents. The
obtained manufactured articles appear free from bubbles,
roughness, surface defects and have a high gloss. This result
is unexpected since it is well known that the PFPEs easily
solubilize the gases which unavoidably develop during radical
curing. Therefore it is surprising that the manufactured
article extracted from the press does not show bubbles.
Without to be bound to any theory the Applicant believes that
this could be explained with the surprisingly low amount of
radical initiator which is necessary to obtain a sufficient
crosslinking to have the required properties for the indicated
applications.</p><p num="0035">The Applicant has found that the crosslinkable polymers
of the invention can be mixed with hydrogenated rubbers to
give cured compounds. This makes available modified hydrogenated
rubbers which easily are released from the moulds, and
which therefore allow to reduce or remove the number of 
discards obtained by using hydrogenated rubbers. In fact one
of the drawbacks of hydrogenated rubbers when they are moulded
is that after a limited number of mouldings, the moulds are
dirty whereby it is necessary to stop the moulding and to
clean the moulds. The modified hydrogenated rubbers as said do
not show the problem of the mould dirting whereby from the
industrial point of view they are advantageous.</p><p num="0036">Furthermore the so cured modified hydrogenated rubbers
show low surface tension and high contact angle with hydrocarbons.
This leads to an improved chemical resistance and to
solvents with respect to the non modified hydrogenated rubbers,
and to an improved friction coefficient. The so modified
hydrogenated rubbers show said effects lasting in the time.
Said effects are unexpected since one could not predict that
the hydrogenated rubbers and the polymers of the invention cocured
and above all led to macroscopically homogeneous
polymers having surface properties such as not to dirty the
moulds, i.e. led to manufactured articles defect free. The
above properties are combined with good mechanical properties
of the manufactured article.</p><p num="0037">The crosslinkable polymer of the invention can therefore
be mixed with one or more uncured hydrogenated rubbers. Examples
of hydrogenated rubbers are natural rubber, ethylene/propylene
rubbers, butyl, butadiene and styrene rubbers. The 
ratio by weight between the polyurethane of the present invention
and the hydrogenated rubber is from 0.3:100 to 50:100,
preferably from 1:100 to 15:100.</p><p num="0038">The curing agents, crosslinking coagents, fillers and
additives used for these rubber mixtures are those above
mentioned.</p><p num="0039">The following Examples illustrate the invention but they
