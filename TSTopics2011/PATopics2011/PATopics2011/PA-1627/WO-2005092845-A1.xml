The subject compounds are particularly useful as PPAR agonists and to treat atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and Syndrome X (also known as metabolic syndrome) in mammals, including humans. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of negative energy balance (NEB) and associated diseases in ruminants. Atherosclerosis, a disease of the arteries, is recognized to be the leading cause of death in the United States and Western Europe. The pathological sequence leading to atherosclerosis and occlusive heart disease is well known. The earliest stage in this sequence is the formation of "fatty streaks" in the carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries and in the aorta. These lesions are yellow in color due to the presence of lipid deposits found principally within smooth-muscle cells and in macrophages of the intima layer of the arteries and aorta. Further, it is postulated that most of the cholesterol found within the fatty streaks, in turn, gives rise to development of the "fibrous plaque," which consists of accumulated intimal smooth muscle cells laden with lipid and surrounded by extra-cellular lipid, collagen, elastin and proteoglycans. These ceils plus matrix form a fibrous cap that covers a deeper deposit of cell debris and more extracellular lipid. The lipid is primarily free and esterified cholesterol. The fibrous plaque forms slowly, and is likely in time to become calcified and necrotic, advancing to the "complicated lesion," which accounts for the arterial occlusion and tendency toward mural thrombosis and arterial muscle spasm that characterize advanced atherosclerosis. Epidemiological evidence has firmly established hyperlipidemia as a primary risk factor in causing cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis. In recent years, leaders of the medical profession have placed renewed emphasis on lowering plasma cholesterol levels, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in particular, as an essential step in prevention of CVD. The upper limits of "normal" are now known to be significantly lower than heretofore appreciated. As a result, large segments of Western populations are now realized to be at particularly high risk. Additional independent risk factors include glucose intolerance, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, and being of the male sex. Cardiovascular disease is especially prevalent among diabetic subjects, at least in part because of the existence of multiple independent risk factors in this population. Successful treatment of hyperlipidemia in the general population, and in diabetic subjects in particular, is therefore of exceptional medical importance. In spite of the early discovery of insulin and its subsequent widespread use in the treatment of diabetes, and the later discovery of and use of sulfonylureas, biguanides and thiazolidenediones, such as troglitazone, rosiglitazone or pioglitazone, as oral hypoglycemic

 agents, the treatment of diabetes could be improved. The use of insulin typically requires multiple daily doses. Determination of the proper dosage of insulin requires frequent estimations of the sugar in urine or blood. The administration of an excess dose of insulin causes hypoglycemia, with effects ranging from mild abnormalities in blood glucose to coma, or even death. Treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II diabetes, NIDDM) usually consists of a combination of diet, exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents, e.g., thiazolidenediones, and in more severe cases, insulin. However, the clinically available hypoglycemic agents can have side effects that limit their use. In the case of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type I), insulin is usually the primary course of therapy. Thus, although there are a variety of anti-atherosclerosis and diabetes therapies, there is a continuing need and a continuing search in this field of art for alternative therapies. Moreover, negative energy balance (NEB) is a problem frequently encountered in ruminants particularly dairy cows. NEB may be experienced at any time during the cows life but it is particularly prevalent during the transition period. The ruminant transition period is defined as the period spanning late gestation to early lactation. This is sometimes defined as from 3 weeks before to three weeks after parturition, but has been expanded to 30 days prepartum to 70 days postpartum (J N Spain and W A Scheer, Tri-State Dairy Nutrition Conference, 2001 , 13). Energy balance is defined as energy intake minus energy output and an animal is descibed as being in negative energy balance if energy intake is insufficient to meet the demands on maintenance and production (eg milk). A cow in NEB has to find the energy to meet the deficit from its body reserves. Thus cows in NEB tend to lose body condition and liveweight, with cows that are more energy deficient tending to lose condition and weight at a faster rate. It is important that the mineral and energy balance and overall health of the cow is managed well in the transition period, since this interval is critically important to the subsequent health, production, and profitability in dairy cows. Long chain fatty acids (or non esterified fatty acids, NEFAs) are also mobilised from body fat. NEFAs, already elevated from around 7 days prepartum, are a significant source of energy to the cow during the early postpartum period, and the greater the energy deficit the higher the concentration of NEFA in the blood. Some workers suggest that in early lactation (Bell and references therein-see above) mammary uptake of NEFAs accounts for some milk fat synthesis. The circulating NEFAs are taken up by the liver and are oxidised to carbon dioxide or ketone bodies, including 3-hydroxybutyrate, by mitochondria, or reconverted via esterification into triglycerides and stored. In non-ruminant mammals it is thought that entry of NEFAs into the mitochondria is controlled by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT- 1) however, some studies have shown that in ruminants there is little change in activity of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 CPT-1 during the transition period (G. N. Douglas, J. K. Drackley, T. R. Overton, H. G. Bateman, J. Dairy Science, 1998, Supp 1 , 81 , 295). Furthermore, the capacity of the ruminant liver for synthesising very low density lipoproteins to export triglycerides from the liver is limited. Significantly, if NEFA uptake by the bovine liver becomes excessive, accumulation of ketone bodies can lead to ketosis, and excessive storage of triglycerides may lead to fatty liver. Fatty liver can lead to prolonged recovery for other disorders, increased incidence of health problems, and development of "downer cows" that die. Thus, fatty liver is a metabolic disease of ruminants, particularly high producing dairy cows, in the transition period that negatively impacts disease resistance (abomasal displacement, lameness), immune function (mastitits, metritis), reproductive performance (oestrus, calving interval, foetal viability, ovarian cysts, metritis, retained placenta), and milk production (peak milk yield, 305 day milk yield). Fatty liver has largely developed by the day after parturition and precedes an induced (secondary) ketosis. It usually results from increased esterification of NEFA absorbed from blood coupled with the low ability of ruminant liver to secrete triglycerides as very low-density lipoproteins. By improving energy balance, or by treating the negative energy balance, the negative extent of the sequelae will be reduced. This is addressed by the compounds of the present invention.</p><p num="p0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to compounds of Formula I</p><p num="p0003"><img id="imgf000004_0001" orientation="portrait" wi="112" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" file="imgf000004_0001.tif" inline="no" he="34"/>

In general, the compounds of this invention can be made by processes that include processes analogous to those known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. Certain processes for the manufacture of the compounds of this invention are provided as further features of the invention and are illustrated by the following reaction schemes. Other processes may be described in the experimental section. The Reaction Schemes herein described are intended to provide a general description of the methodology employed in the preparation of many of the Examples given. However, it will be evident from the detailed descriptions given in the Experimental section that the modes of preparation employed extend further than the general procedures described herein. In particular, it is noted that the compounds prepared according to these Schemes may be modified further to provide new Examples within the scope of this invention. For example, an ester functionality may be reacted further using procedures well known to those skilled in the art to give another ester, an amide, an acid, a carbinol or a ketone. As an initial note, in the preparation of compounds of the present invention, it is noted that some of the preparation methods useful for the preparation of the compounds described herein may require protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary amine, secondary amine, carboxyl in intermediates). The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparative methods and can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The use of such protection/deprotection methods is also within the ordinary skill in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991. For example, in the reaction schemes below, certain compounds contain primary amines or carboxylic acid functionalities, which may interfere with reactions at other sites of the molecule if left unprotected. Accordingly, such functionalities may be protected by an appropriate protecting group, which may be removed in a subsequent step. Suitable protecting groups for amine and carboxylic acid protection include those protecting groups commonly used in peptide synthesis (such as N-t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and 9- fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl for amines and lower alkyl or benzyl esters for carboxylic acids) which are generally not chemically reactive under the reaction conditions described and can typically be removed without chemically altering other functionality in the compound.

Any glucosidase inhibitor can be used in combination with a compound of the present invention. A glucosidase inhibitor inhibits the enzymatic hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates by glycoside hydrolases, for example amylase or maltase, into bioavailable simple sugars, for example, glucose. The rapid metabolic action of glucosidases, particularly following the intake of high levels of carbohydrates, results in a state of alimentary hyperglycemia which, in adipose or diabetic subjects, leads to enhanced secretion of insulin, increased fat synthesis and a reduction in fat degradation. Following such hyperglycemias, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="41"/>-->
 hypoglycemia frequently occurs, due to the augmented levels of insulin present. Additionally, it is known chyme remaining in the stomach promotes the production of gastric juice, which initiates or favors the development of gastritis or duodenal ulcers. Accordingly, glucosidase inhibitors are known to have utility in accelerating the passage of carbohydrates through the stomach and inhibiting the absorption of glucose from the intestine. Furthermore, the conversion of carbohydrates into iipids of the fatty tissue and the subsequent incorporation of alimentary fat into fatty tissue deposits is accordingly reduced or delayed, with the concomitant benefit of reducing or preventing the deleterious abnormalities resulting therefrom. Such glucosidase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Biochemistry (1969) 8: 4214). A generally preferred glucosidase inhibitor includes an amylase inhibitor. An amylase inhibitor is a glucosidase inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic degradation of starch or glycogen into maltose. Such amylase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Methods Enzymol. (1955) 1: 149).

 The starting materials and reagents for the above-described compounds of the present invention and combination agents, are also readily available or can be easily synthesized by those skilled in the art using conventional methods of organic synthesis. For example, many of the compounds used herein, are related to, or are derived from compounds in which there is a large scientific interest and commercial need, and accordingly many such compounds are commercially available or are reported in the literature or are easily prepared from other commonly available substances by methods which are reported in the literature. Some of the compounds of the present invention or intermediates in their synthesis have asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore are enantiomers or diastereomers. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known per se., for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by, for example, chiral HPLC methods or converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diasteromeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, an enantiomeric mixture of the compounds or an intermediate in their synthesis which contain an acidic or basic moiety may be separated into their compounding pure enantiomers by forming a diastereomeric salt with an optically pure chiral base or acid (e.g., 1-phenyl-ethyl amine or tartaric acid) and separating the diasteromers by fractional crystallization followed by neutralization to break the salt, thus providing the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers and mixtures thereof are considered as part of the present invention. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention are atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of the present invention. More specifically, the compounds of the present invention can be obtained by fractional crystallization of the basic intermediate with an optically pure chiral acid to form a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="45"/>-->
 diastereomeric salt. Neutralization techniques are used to remove tne salt and provide the enantiomerically pure compounds. Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be obtained in enantiomerically enriched form by resolving the racemate of the final compound or an intermediate in its synthesis (preferably the final compound) employing chromatography (preferably high pressure liquid chromatography [HPLC]) on an asymmetric resin (preferably Chiralcel™ AD or OD (obtained from Chiral Technologies, Exton, Pennsylvania)) with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon (preferably heptane or hexane) containing between 0 and 50% isopropanol (preferably between 2 and 20 %) and between 0 and 5% of an alkyl amine (preferably 0.1% of diethylamine). Concentration of the produ ct containing fractions affords the desired materials. Some of the compounds of the present invention are acidic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Some of the compounds of the present invention are basic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. AN such salts are within the scope of the present invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods such as combining the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate . The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. The compounds can be obtained in crystalline form by dissolution in an appropriate solvent(s) such as ethanol, hexanes or water/ethanol mixtures. The compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs are all adapted to therapeutic use as agents that activate peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) activity in mammals, particularly humans. Thus, it is believed the compounds of the present invention, by activating the PPAR receptor, stimulate transcription of key genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and also those involved in high density lipoprotein (HDL) assembly (for example apolipoprotein Al gene transcription), accordingly reducing whole body fat and increasing HDL cholesterol - By virtue of their activity, these agents also reduce plasma levels of triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and their associated components in mammals, particularly humans, as well as increasing HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein Al. Hence, these compounds are useful for the treatment and correction of the various dysiipidemias observed to be associated with the development and incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, including hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The present compounds are also useful for modulation of plasma and or serum or tissue lipids or lipoproteins, such as HDL subtypes (e.g., increase, including pre-beta HDL, HDL-1,-2 and 3 particles) as measured by precipitation or by apo-protein content, size, density, NMR profile, FPLC and charge and particle number and its constituents; and LDL 
<!-- EPO <DP n="46"/>-->
 subtypes (including LDL subtypes e.g., decreasing small dense LDL, oxidized LDL, VLDL, apo(a) and Lp(a)) as measured by precipitation, or by apo-protein content, size density, NMR profile, FPLC and charge; IDL and remnants (decrease); phospholipids (e.g., increase HDL phospholipids); apo-lipoproteins (increase A-l, A-ll, A-IV, decrease total and LDL B-1 CO, decrease B-48, modulate C-ll, C-lll, E, J); paraoxonase (increase, anti-oxidant effects, anti- inflammatory effects); decrease post-prandial (hyper)lipemia; decrease triglycerides, decrease non-HDL; elevate HDL in subjects with low HDL and optimize and increase ratios of HDL to LDL (e.g., greater than 0.25). Given the positive correlation between triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and their associated apolipoproteins in blood with the development of cardiovascular, cerebral vascular and peripheral vascular diseases, the compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs, by virtue of their pharmacologic action, are useful for the prevention, arrestment and/or regression of atherosclerosis and its associated disease states. These include cardiovascular disorders (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, corona ry artery disease, ventricular dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary vascular disease, vascular hemostatic disease, cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction), complications due to cardiovascular disease, and cognitive dysfunction (including, but not limited to, dementia secondary to atherosclerosis, transient cerebral ischemic attacks, neurodegeneration, neuronal deficient, and delayed onset or procession of Alzheimer's disease). Thus, given the ability of the compounds of the present invention, their prodru gs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs to reduce plasma triglycerides and total plasma cholesterol, and increase plasma HDL cholesterol, they are of use in the treatment of diabetes, including impaired glucose tolerance, diabetic complications, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, as described previously. In addition, the compounds are useful For the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. Also, the compounds are useful in the treatment of obesity given the ability of the compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs to increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation. The utility of the compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs as medical agents in the treatment of the above described disease/conditions in mammals (e.g. humans, male or female) is demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of the present invention in one or more of the conventional assays and in vivo assays described below. The in vivo assays (with appropriate modifications within the skill in the art) can be used to determine the activity of other lipid or triglyceride controlling agents as well as the compounds of the present invention. Thus, the protocols described below can also be used to demonstrate the utility of the combinations of the agents (i.e., the com ounds of the present invention) described herein. In addition, such assays provide a means whereby the activities of the compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such 
<!-- EPO <DP n="47"/>-->
 compounds and prodrugs (or the other agents described herein) can be compared to each other and with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in mammals, including humans, for the treatment of such diseases. The following protocols can of course be varied by those skilled in the art. PPAR FRET Assay Measurement of coactivator recruitment by a nuclear receptor-ligand association is a method for evaluating the ability of a ligand to produce a functional response through a nuclear receptor. The PPAR FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assay measures the ligand-dependent interaction between nuclear receptor and coactivator. GST/ PPAR (α,β,and γ) ligand binding domain (LBD) is labeled with a europium-tagged anti-GST antibody, while an SRC-1 (Sterol Receptor Coactivator-1) synthetic peptide containing an amino terminus long chain biotin molecule is labeled with streptavidin-linked allophycocyanin (APC). Binding of ligand to the PPAR LBD causes a conformational change that allows SRC- 1 to bind. Upon SRC-1 binding, the donor FRET molecule (europium) comes in close proximity to the acceptor molecule (APC), resulting in fluorescence energy transfer between donor (337 nm excitation and 620 nm emission) and acceptor (620 nm excitation and 665 nm emission). Increases in the ratio of 665nm emission to 620 nm emission is a measure of the ability of the ligand-PPAR LBD to recruit SRC-1 synthetic peptide and therefore a measure of the ability of a ligand to produce a functional response through the PPAR receptor. [1] GST/ PPAR LBD Expression. The human PPARα LBD (amino acids 235-507) is fused to the carboxy terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pGEX-6P-1 (Pfizer, Inc.).

Fusion protein is purified on glutathione sepharose 4B beads, eluted in 10 mM reduced glutathione, and dialyzed against 1x PBS at 4°C. Fusion protein is quantitated by Bradford assay (M.M.</p><p num="p0054">Bradford, Analst. Biochem. 72:248-254; 1976), and stored at -20°C in 1x PBS containing 40% glycerol and 5 mM dithiothreitol.

Animals are dosed dai ly by oral gavage with vehicle (water or 0.5% methylcellulose 0.05% Tween 80) or with vehicle containing test compound at the desired dose for 5 days. HDL-cholesterol and human a poAI are determined initially (day 0) and 90 minutes post dose (day 5) using methods based on standard procedures. Mouse HDL is separated from apoB-containing lipoproteins by dextran sulfate precipitation as described elsewhere (Francone et al., J. Lipid. Res. 1996, 37:1268-1277). Cholesterol is measured enzymatically using a commercially available cholesterol/HP Reagent kit (Boehringer MannHeim, Indianapolis, IND) and spectrophotometrically quantitated on a microplate reader. Human apoAI is measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (Francone et al_, J. Lipid. Res. 1996, 37: 1268-1277). Measurement of glucose lowering in the ob/ob mouse The hypoglycemic activity of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by the amount of test compound that reduces glucose levels relative to a vehicle without test compound in male ob/ob mice. The test also allows the determination of an 
<!-- EPO <DP n="49"/>-->
 approximate minimal effective dose (MED) value for the in vivo reduction of plasma glucose concentration in such mice for such test compounds. Five to eight week old male C57BL/6J-ob/ob mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) are housed five per cage under standard animal care practices. After a one- week acclimation period, the animals are weighed and 25 microliters of blood are collected from the retro-orbital sinus prior to any treatment. The blood sample is immediately diluted 1:5 with saline containing 0.025% sodium heparin, and held on ice for metabolite analysis. Animals are assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean for plasma glucose concentration. After group assignment, animals are dosed orally each day for four days with the vehicle consisting of either: (1 ) 0.25% w/v methyl cellulose in water without pH adjustment; or (2) 0.1% Pluronic<sup>®</sup> P105 Block Copolymer Surfactant (BASF Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment. On day 5, the animals are weighed again and then dosed orally with a test compound or the vehicle alone. All compounds are administered in vehicle consisting of either: (1) 0.25% w/v methyl cellulose in water; (2) 10% DMSO/0.1 % Pluronic<sup>®</sup> in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment; or 3) neat PEG 400 without pH adjustment. The animals are then bled from the retro-orbital sinus three hours later for determination of blood metabolite levels. The freshly collected samples are centrifuged for two minutes at 10,000 x g at room temperature. The supernatant is analyzed for glucose, for example, by the Abbott VP™ (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostics Division, Irving, TX) and VP Super System<sup>®</sup> Autoanalyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX), or by the Abbott Spectrum</p><p num="p0055">CCX™ (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX) using the A-Gent™Glucose-UV Test reagent system (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX) (a modification of the method of Richterich and Dauwalder, Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift, 101: 860 (1971)) (hexokinase method) using a 100 mg/dl standard. Plasma glucose is then calculated by the equation: Plasma glucose (mg/dl)=Sample value x 8.14 where 8.14 is the dilution factor, adjusted for plasma hematocrit (assuming the hematocrit is 44%). The animals dosed with vehicle maintain substantially unchanged hyperglycemic glucose levels (e.g., greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl), animals treated with compounds having hypoglycemic activity at suitable doses have significantly depressed glucose levels. Hypoglycemic activity of the test compounds is determined by statistical analysis (unpaired t- test) of the mean plasma glucose concentration between the test compound group and vehicle-treated group on day 5. The above assay carried out with a range of doses of a test compound allows the determination of an approximate minimal effective dose (MED) value for the in vivo reduction of plasma glucose concentration. Measurement of insulin, triglyceride. and cholesterol levels in the ob/ob mouse The compounds of the present invention are readily adapted to clinical use as hyperinsulinemia reversing agents, triglyceride lowering agents and hypocholesterolemic 
<!-- EPO <DP n="50"/>-->
 agents. Such activity can be determined by the amount of test compound that reduces insulin, triglycerides or cholesterol levels relative to a control vehicle without test compound in male ob/ob mice. Since the concentration of cholesterol in blood is closely related to the development of cardiovascular, cerebral vascular or peripheral vascular disorders, the compounds of the present invention, by virtue of their hypocholesterolemic action, prevent, arrest and/or regress atherosclerosis. Since the concentration of insulin in blood is related to the promotion of vascular cell growth and increased renal sodium retention, (in addition to the other actions, e.g., promotion of glucose utilization) and these functions are known causes of hypertension, the compounds of the present invention, by virtue of their hypoinsulinemic action, prevent, arrest and/or regress hypertension. Since the concentration of triglycerides in blood contributes to the overall levels of blood lipids, the compounds of the present invention, by virtue of their triglyceride lowering and/or free fatty acid lowering activity prevent, arrest and/or regress hyperlipidemia. Free fatty acids contribute to the overall level of blood lipids and independently have been negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity in a variety of physiologic and pathologic states. Five to eight week old male C57BL/6J-ob/ob mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) are housed five per cage under standard animal care practices and fed standard rodent diet ad libitum. After a one-week acclimation period, the animals are weighed and 25 microliters of blood are collected from the retro-orbital sinus prior to any treatment. The blood sample is immediately diluted 1:5 with saline containing 0.025% sodium heparin, and held on ice for plasma glucose analysis. Animals are assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean for plasma glucose concentration. The compound to be tested is administered by oral gavage as an about 0.02% to 2.0% solution (weight/volume (w/v)) in either (1) 10% DMSO/0.1 % Pluronic<sup>®</sup> P105 Block Copolymer Surfactant (BASF Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment or (2) 0.25% w/v methylcellulose in water without pH adjustment. Alternatively, the compound to be tested can be administered by oral gavage dissolved in or in suspension in neat PEG 400. Single daily dosing (s.i.d.) or twice daily dosing (b.i.d.) is maintained for 1 to, for example, 15 days. Control mice receive the 10% DMSO/0.1% Pluronic<sup>®</sup> P105 in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment or the 0.25% w/v methylcellulose in water without pH adjustment, or the neat PEG 400 without pH adjustment. Three hours after the last dose is administered, the animals are sacrificed and blood is collected into 0.5 ml serum separator tubes containing 3.6 mg of a 1 :1 weight/weight sodium fluoride: potassium oxalate mixture. The freshly collected samples are centrifuged for two minutes at 10,000 x g at room temperature, and the serum supernatant is transferred and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="51"/>-->
 diluted 1:1 volume/volume with a 1TIU/ml aprotinin solution in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment. The diluted serum samples are then stored at -80°C until analysis. The thawed, diluted serum samples are analyzed for insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol levels. Serum insulin concentration is determined using Equate<sup>®</sup> RIA INSULIN kits (double antibody method; as specified by the manufacturer) available from Binax, South Portland, ME. The interassay coefficient of variation is &lt; 10%. Serum triglycerides are determined using the Abbott VP™ and VP Super System<sup>®</sup> Autoanalyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX), or the Abbott Spectrum CCX<sup>™</sup> (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX) using the A-Gent™ Triglycerides Test reagent system (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostics Division, Irving, TX) (lipase-coupled enzyme method; a modification of the method of Sampson, et al., Clinical Chemistry 21: 1983 (1975)). Serum total cholesterol levels are determined using the Abbott VP™ and VP Super System<sup>®</sup> Autoanalyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX), and A-Gent™ Cholesterol Test reagent system (cholesterol esterase-coupled enzyme method; a modification of the method of Allain, et al. Clinical Chemistry 20: 470 (1974)) using 100 and 300 mg/dl standards. Serum free fatty acid concentration is determined utilizing a kit from WAKO (Osaka, Japan), as adapted for use with the Abbott VP™ and VP Super System® Autoanalyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX), or the Abbott Spectrum CCX™ (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX). Serum insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids and total cholesterol levels are then calculated by the equations: Serum insulin (μU/ml) = Sample value x 2; Serum triglycerides (mg/dl) = Sample value x 2; Serum total cholesterol (mg/dl) = Sample value x 2; Serum free fatty acid (μEq/l) = Sample value x 2; where 2 is the dilution factor. The animals dosed with vehicle maintain substantially unchanged, elevated serum insulin (e.g., 275 μU/ml), serum triglycerides (e.g., 235 mg/dl), serum free fatty acid (1500 mEq/ml) and serum total cholesterol (e.g., 190 mg/dl) levels. The serum insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acid and total cholesterol lowering activity of the test compounds are determined by statistical analysis (unpaired t-test) of the mean serum insulin, triglycerides, or total cholesterol concentration between the test compound group and the vehicle-treated control group. Measurement of energy expenditure in rats As would be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art, during increased energy expenditure, animals generally consume more oxygen. In addition, metabolic fuels such as, for example, glucose and fatty acids, are oxidized to C0<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>0 with the concomitant evolution of heat, commonly referred to in the art as thermogenesis. Thus, the measurement of oxygen consumption in animals, including humans and companion animals, is an indirect measure of thermogenesis. Indirect calorimetry is commonly used in animals, e.g., humans, by those skilled in the relevant art to measure such energy expenditures. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="52"/>-->
 Those skilled in the art understand that increased energy expenditure and the concomitant burning of metabolic fuels resulting in the production of heat may be efficacious with respect to the treatment of, e.g., obesity. The ability of the compounds of the present invention to generate a thermogenic response can be demonstrated according to the following protocol: This in vivo screen is designed to evaluate the efficacy of compounds that are PPAR agonists, using as an efficacy endpoint measurement of whole body oxygen consumption. The protocol involves: (a) dosing fatty Zucker rats for about 6 days, and (b) measuring oxygen consumption. Male fatty Zucker rats having a body weight range of from about 400 g to about 500 g are housed for from about 3 to about 7 days in individual cages under standard laboratory conditions prior to the initiation of the study. A compound of the present invention and a vehicle is administered by oral gavage as a single daily dose given between about 3 p.m. to about 6 p.m . for about 6 days. A compound of the present invention is dissolved in vehicle containing about 0.25 % of methyl cellulose. The dosing volume is about 1 ml. About 1 day after the last dose of the compound is administered, oxygen consumption is measured using an open circuit, indirect calorimeter (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH 43204). The Oxymax gas sensors are calibrated with N<sub>2</sub> gas and a gas mixture (about 0.5 % of C0<sub>2</sub>, about 20.5 % of 0<sub>2</sub>, about 79 % of N<sub>2</sub>) before each experiment. The subject rats are removed from their home cages and their body weights recorded. The rats are placed into the sealed chambers (43 x 43 x 10 cm) of the Oxymax, the chambers are placed in the activity monitors, and the air flow rate through the chambers is then set at from about 1.6 L/min to about 1.7 L/min. The Oxymax software then calculates the oxygen consumption (mL/kg/h) by the rats based on the flow rate of air through the chambers and the difference in oxygen content at the inlet and output ports. The activity monitors have 15 infrared light beams spaced about one inch apart on each axis, and ambulatory activity is recorded when two consecutive beams are broken, and the results are recorded as counts. Oxygen consumption and ambulatory activity are measured about every 10 min for from about 5 h to about 6.5 h. Resting oxygen consumption is calculated on individual rats by averaging the values excluding the first 5 values and the values obtained during time periods where ambulatory activity exceeds about 100 counts. In Vivo Atherosclerosis Assay Anti-atherosclerotic effects of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by the amount of compound required to reduce the lipid deposition in rabbit aorta. Male New Zealand White rabbits are fed a diet containing 0.2% cholesterol and 10% coconut oil for 4 days (meal-fed once per day). Rabbits are bled from the marginal ear vein and total plasma cholesterol values are determined from these samples. The rabbits are then assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean ±SD for total 
<!-- EPO <DP n="53"/>-->
 plasma cholesterol concentration, HDL cholesterol concentration and triglyceride concentration. After group assignment, rabbits are dosed daily with compound given as a dietary admix or on a small piece of gelatin based confection. Control rabbits receive only the dosing vehicle, be it the food or the gelatin confection. The cholesterol/coconut oil diet is continued along with the compound administration throughout the study. Plasma cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride values can be determined at any point during the study by obtaining blood from the marginal ear vein. After 3-5 months, the rabbits are sacrificed and the aortae are removed from the thoracic arch to the branch of the iliac arteries. The aortae are cleaned of adventitia, opened longitudinally and then stained with Sudan IV as described by Hoiman et. al. (Lab. Invest. 1958, 7, 42-47). The percent of the surface area stained is quantitated by densitometry using an Optimas Image Analyzing System (Image Processing Solutions; North Reading MA). Reduced lipid deposition is indicated by a reduction in the percent surface area stained in the compound- receiving group in comparison with the control rabbits. The utility of the formula I compounds useful in the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs as agents in the treatment of the above described disease/conditions in ruminants is additionally demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of the present invention in the assays described below. Negative energy balance To determine negative energy balance, serum concentrations of NEFAs or ketone bodies, or levels of triglycerides in liver tissues, are measured. Higher than 'normal' levels of NEFA's and/or triglycerides and/or ketone bodies are indicators of negative energy balance. Levels considered 'higher than normal' or 'excessive' are: NEFA's &gt;800μmol/L in serum. Triglycerides &gt;10% w/w in liver tissue. Ketone bodies &gt;1.2 Dmol/L in serum. Determination of changes in blood non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations and liver triglycerides levels: Compounds are administered once or several times in the transition period at dose levels predicted to be effective by comparing results of in-vitro receptor affinity tests in laboratory species and pharmacokinetic evaluations in cattle. NEFA levels are determined via standard laboratory methods, for example, using the commercial WAKO NEFA kit (Wako Chemical Co., USA, Dallas, TX, 994-75409), and liver triglyceride content is determined using the method as described in the literature (J. K. Drackley, J. J. Veenhuizen, M. J. Richard and J. W. Young, J Dairy Sci, 1991 , 74, 4254)). All animals may be obtained from a commercial dairy farm approximately thirty days prior to anticipated calving date. The cows are moved into separate building, approximately 
<!-- EPO <DP n="54"/>-->
 10-14 days prior to their anticipated calving dates and switched to the TMR-Close-Up dry diet. Enrolment of animals in the study begins approximately 7 days prior to their anticipated calving dates. The animals may be moved to the "on-test" pen, weighed and are locked each AM into feed stanchions. At that time, appropriate doses are administered and appropriate blood samples obtained (see table below for sample data for a PPAR alpha agonist, compound Z, 2-Methyl-5-(4'-trifluoromethoxy-biphenyl-4-ylsulfamoyl)-benzoic acid (EXAMPLE 193). Animals enrolled in T01 were treated with vehicle control every other day (eod) beginning at the estimated Day -7 prior to calving, and once again at calving. Animals enrolled in T02 were treated with compound Z, 2-Methyl-5-(4'-trifluoromethoxy-biphenyl-4-ylsulfamoyl)- benzoic acid (EXAMPLE 193) every other day beginning at the estimated Day -7 prior to calving, and once again at caiving.</p><p num="p0056"><img id="imgf000054_0001" orientation="portrait" wi="129" img-format="tif" img-content="table" file="imgf000054_0001.tif" inline="no" he="57"/>
 As soon as possible post-calving (~ 30 minutes) the cow is transferred to the freestall barn for the next scheduled milking (6:00 hrs and 19:00 hrs). Treatments on postpartum animals are administered every other day through day 8. Pre and post-calving NEFA samples are analyzed using the WAKO NEFA-C test kit (#994-75409). Post-calving liver biopsies are performed on all cows on days 5, 10 and 14 post-calving. Tissues are transported on ice and stored frozen at -70°F. At the conclusion of the study, samples are analysed of liver triglyceride levels using the method described by Drackley, J.K. et al. (1991 , J Dairy Sci (74):4254-4264). All animals treated with test article (T02) exhibited significantly lower (p&lt;0.10) serum NEFA levels as compared to control on days 1-8, with the exceptions of T02 on day 5(p=0.17). All treatment regimens significantly lowered liver triglyceride levels compared to placebo at all time points measured (Days 5, 10 and 14 postcalving).

Administration of the compounds of the present invention can be via any method which delivers a compound of this invention systemically and/or locally. These methods include oral routes, parenteral, intraduodenai routes, etc. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered orally, but parenteral administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intramedullary) may be utilized, for example, where oral administration is inappropriate or where the patient is unable to ingest the drug. In general an amount of a compound of the present invention is used that is sufficient to achieve the therapeutic effect desired (e.g., lipid lowering). In general an effective dosage for the compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably about 0.O05 to about 5 mg/kg/day.

<!-- EPO <DP n="57"/>-->
 The compounds of the present invention are generally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds of this invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, diluent or carrier. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered individually or together in any conventional oral, parenteral, rectal or transdermal dosage form. For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. A preferred formulation is a solution or suspension in an oil, for example olive oil, Miglyol™ or Capmul™, in a soft gelatin capsule. Antioxidants may be added to prevent long term degradation as appropriate. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of the present invention can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof. For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol can be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water-soluble salts. Such aqueous solutions may be suitably buffered, if necessary, and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For purposes of transdermal (e.g., topical) adm inistration, dilute sterile, aqueous or partially aqueous solutions (usually in about 0.1 % to 5%&gt; concentration), otherwise similar to the above parenteral solutions, are prepared. Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a certain amount of active ingredient are known, or will be apparent in light of this disclosure, to those skilled in this art. For examples of methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 19th Edition (1995). Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may contain 0.1%- 95% of the compound(s) of the present invention, preferably 1%-70%. In any event, the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="58"/>-->
 composition or formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of a compound(s) according to the present invention in an amount effective to treat the disease/condition of the subject being treated, e.g., atherosclerosis. Since the present invention has an aspect that relates to the treatment of the disease/conditions described herein with a combination of active ingredients, which may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions: a compound of the present invention, a prodrug thereof or a salt of such compound or prodrugs and a second compound as described above. The kit for example comprises means for containing the separate compositions such as a container, a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Typically the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician. An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening. It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, ...etc.... Second Week, Monday, Tuesday,..." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several pills or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of a compound of the present invention can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the second compound can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="59"/>-->
 In another specific embodiment of the invention, a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken. The compounds of the present invention either alone or in combination with each other or other compounds generally will be administered in a convenient formulation. The following formulation examples only are illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. In the formulations which follow, "active ingredient" means a compound of the present invention.

 indicated otherwise, percent is percent by weight given the component and the total weight of the composition, temperature is in °C or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric. Commercial reagents were utilized without furt_her purification. Room or ambient temperature refers to 20-25 °C. All non-aqueous rea ctions were run under a nitrogen atmosphere for convenience and to maximize yields. Concentration in vacuo means that a rotary evaporator was used. The names for the compounds of the invention were created by the Autonom 2.0 PC-batch version from Beilstein Informationssysteme GmbH (ISBN 3-89536- 976-4). "DMSO" means dimethyl sulfoxide. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 (Varian Co., Palo Alto, CA) NMR spectrometer at ambient temperature. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (δ) relative to an external standard (tetramethylsilane). The peak shapes are denoted as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet, t, triplet, q, quartet, m, multiplet with the prefix br indicating a broadened signal. The coupling constant (J) data given have a maximum error of +0.41 Hz due to the digitization of the spectra that are acquired. Mass spectra were obtained by (1) atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in alternating positive and negative ion mode using a</p><p num="p0060">Fisons Platform II Spectrometer or a Micromass MZD Spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) or (2) electrospray ionization in alternating positive and negative ion mode using a Micromass MZD Spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) Λ/vith a Gilson LC-MS interface (Gilson Instruments, Middleton, Wl) or (3) a QP-8000 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) operating in positive or negative single ion monitoring mode, utilizing electrospray ionization or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. Where the intensity of chlorine- or bromine-containing ions are described, the expected intensity ratio was observed (approximately 3:1 for <sup>35</sup>CI/<sup>37</sup>CI-containing ions and 1:1 for <sup>79</sup>Br/<sup>81</sup>Br-containing ions) and the position of only the lower mass ion is given.

 To a solution of 5-chlorosulfonyl-2-methylbenzoic acid (200 mg, 0.85 mmol) and p- benzyloxyaniline (187 mg, 0.94 mmol) in 6 ml acetone and 3 ml dimethylformamide was added a solution of sodium bicarbonate (215 mg, 0.56 mmol) in 2 ml water. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The acetone was then removed under reduced pressure and the residual mixture was partitioned between 25 ml 1N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution and 25 ml ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with 2 x 25 ml ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts were dried (anhydrous sodium sulfate) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, 15 gm) eluting with 9:1 chloroform/methanol to yield a white solid (154 mg). The solid was triturated with dichloromethane to yield the title compound (93 mg, 28 % yield) as a white solid.
