Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relates to novel phosphonate derivatives, hydroxyphosphinyl derivatives, and phosphoramidate derivatives that inhibit N-Acetylated α-Linked Acidic Dipeptidase (NAALADase) enzyme activity, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives, and methods of using such derivatives to inhibit NAALADase enzyme activity and to treat prostate diseases in an animal.</p><p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p><heading>Prostate Cancer</heading><p>Prostate cancer is the leading form of cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer for men in the United States. The American Cancer Society has estimated that in 1996 alone, 317,100 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and 41,400 deaths were caused by prostate cancer. The incidence rate of prostate cancer increased 65% between 1980 and 1990, and will continue to rise with improved screening tests and longer life expectancies. While most men used to die of other illnesses before prostate cancer had a chance to develop, higher prostate cancer mortality rates are expected as men live longer and the disease has more time to progress.</p><p>In 1993, the molecular cloning of Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) was reported as a potential prostate carcinoma marker and hypothesized to serve as a target for imaging and cytotoxic treatment modalities for prostate cancer. PSMA antibodies, particularly indium-111 labelled and tritium labelled PSMA antibodies, have been described and examined clinically for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. PSMA is expressed in prostatic ductal epithelium and is present in seminal plasma, prostatic fluid and urine. In 1996, it was found go that the expression of PSMA cDNA confers the activity of NAALADase.</p><heading>NAALADase Inhibitors</heading><p>NAAG and NAALADase have been implicated in several human and animal pathological conditions relating to glutamate abnormalities and neurotoxicity. For example, it has been demonstrated that intra-hippocampal injections of NAAG elicit prolonged seizure activity. More recently, it was reported that rats genetically prone to epileptic seizures have a persistent increase in their basal level of NAALADase activity. These observations lend support the hypothesis that increased availability of synaptic glutamate elevates seizure susceptibility, and suggest that NAALADase inhibitors may provide anti-epileptic activity.</p><p>NAAG and NAALADase have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS and in the pathologically similar animal disease called Hereditary Canine Spinal Muscular Atrophy (HCSMA). It has been shown that concentrations of NAAG and its metabolites--NAA, glutamate and aspartate--are elevated two- to three-fold in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients and HCSMA dogs. Additionally, NAALADase activity is significantly increased (two- to three-fold) in post-mortem spinal cord tissue from ALS patients and HCSMA dogs. As such, NAALADase inhibitors might be clinically useful in curbing the progression of ALS if an increased metabolism of NAAG is responsible for the alterations of CSF levels of these acidic amino acids and peptides.</p><p>Abnormalities in NAAG levels and NAALADase activity have also been documented in post-mortem schizophrenic brain, specifically in the prefrontal and limbic brain regions.</p><p>The findings described above suggest that NAALADase inhibitors could be useful in treating glutamate abnormalities. However, the present invention is directed to the surprising and unexpected discovery that the novel compounds of the present invention are not only effective NAALADase inhibitors but are effective in treating prostate diseases, particularly prostate cancer. Although the cancer data relate to prostate cancer cells, NAALADase inhibitors are expected to be equally effective in treating cancer of other tissues where NAALADase enzyme reside, such as the brain, kidney and testis.</p><p>While a few NAALADase inhibitors have been identified, they have only been used in non-clinical research. Examples of such inhibitors include general metallopeptidase inhibitors such as o-phenanthroline, metal chelators such as EGTA and EDTA, and peptide analogs such as quisqualic acid and β-NAAG. Accordingly, a need exists for more NAALADase inhibitors to be identified and, particularly, for the treatment of prostate diseases such as prostate cancer.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention is directed to novel phosphonate derivatives, hydroxyphosphinyl derivatives, and phosphoramidate derivatives that inhibit N-Acetylated α-Linked Acidic Dipeptidase (NAALADase) enzyme activity, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives, and methods of using such derivatives to inhibit NAALADase activity and to treat diseases in an animal such as cancer and associated diseases of the prostate.</p><p>Preferred compositions of the present invention include compounds of formula I: ##STR1## wherein R.sub.1 is hydrogen, C.sub.1 -C.sub.9 straight or branched chain alkyl, C.sub.2 -C.sub.9 straight or branched chain alkenyl group, C.sub.3 -C.sub.8 cycloalkyl, C.sub.5 -C.sub.7 cycloalkenyl, or Ar.sub.1 ;</p><p>X is CH.sub.2, O, or N; and</p><p>R.sub.2 is C.sub.1 -C.sub.9 straight or branched chain alkyl, C.sub.2 -C.sub.9 straight or branched chain alkenyl group, C.sub.3 -C.sub.8 cycloalkyl, C.sub.5 -C.sub.7 cycloalkenyl, or Ar.sub.1.</p><p>The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising:</p><p>(i) a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I; and</p><p>(ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p>Preferably, the compound of formula I is present in an amount that is effective for inhibiting NAALADase enzyme activity, or treating a prostate disease in an animal.</p><p>The present invention further relates to a method of inhibiting NAALADase enzyme activity in an animal, comprising administering an effective amount of the compound of formula I to said animal.</p><p>Finally, the present invention relates to a method of treating a prostate disease in an animal, comprising administering an effective amount of the compound of formula I to said animal.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p>FIG. 1 is a bar graph plotting the growth of the prostate cancer cell line, LNCAP, against various concentrations of quisqualic acid. FIG. 1 shows the effect of 7-day treatment with quisqualate on the growth of LNCAP cells. Concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 1 μM of quisqualate show a sharp dose-dependent decrease of LNCAP cell proliferation as indicated by the significant decrease in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine.</p><p>FIG. 2 is a bar graph plotting the growth of the prostate cancer cell line, LNCAP, against various concentrations of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid. FIG. 2 shows the effect of 7-day treatment with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid on the growth of LNCAP cells. Concentrations ranging from 100 pM to 10 nM of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid show a sharp dose-dependent decrease of LNCAP cell proliferation as indicated by the significant decrease in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine.</p><p>FIG. 3 is a line graph of the response of LnCap human prostate tumors to daily treatment with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid. Mean of individual tumor volumes are plotted as a function of time after the start of treatment. Error bars represent the SEM. Treatment with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid for six weeks resulted in statistically significant difference between both the control group and animals given daily injections of drug (p=0.04), and the control group and animals implanted with polymer (p=0.02).</p><p>FIG. 4 is a line graph plotting the survival percentage of animals treated with 2(phosphonomethyl) pentanedioic acid against the number of days. FIG. 4 shows the higher mean survival percentage of animals injected with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid mixed with polymer and receiving intratumoral injections of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid compared to vehicle control. The graph shows that 88% of the animals treated with polymer were alive after 72 days compared to 55% treated with intratumoral injection and 32% of animals treated with vehicle control.</p><p>FIG. 5 is a line graph plotting tumor growth against days following rat Dunning cell R3327-G injections. Prostate cancer cells were injected on Day 0. Various dosages of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid and vehicle were injected suscutaneously daily from Days 1 to 84. FIG. 5 shows that tumor growth slowed as a function of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid dosage.</p><p>FIG. 6 is a line graph of the response of R3327-G rat prostate tumors to daily treatment with 2-[[(phenylmethyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid. Mean of individual tumor volumes expressed relative to the volume at the start of treatment (V/V.sub.o) are plotted as a function of time. Treatment with 2-[[(phenylmethyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid for 2.5 weeks resulted in a statistically significant difference between the control group and animals given daily injections of 1 μg of drug intratumorally (p=0.02).</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Definitions</p><p>"Compound 3" refers to 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentane-dioic acid, a NAALADase inhibitor.</p><p>"Inhibition", in the context of enzymes, refers to reversible enzyme inhibition such as competitive, uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition. Competitive, uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition can be distinguished by the effects of an inhibitor on the reaction kinetics of an enzyme. Competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor combines reversibly with the enzyme in such a way that it competes with a normal substrate for binding at the active site. The affinity between the inhibitor and the enzyme may be measured by the inhibitor constant, K.sub.i, which is defined as: ##EQU1## wherein [E] is the concentration of the enzyme, [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor, and [EI] is the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex formed by the reaction of the enzyme with the inhibitor. Unless otherwise specified, K.sub.i as used herein refers to the affinity between the inventive compounds and NAALADase. "IC50" is a related term used to define the concentration or amount of a compound which is required to cause a 50% inhibition of the target enzyme.</p><p>The term "inhibition", in the context of tumor growth or tumor cell growth, may be assessed by delayed appearance of primary or secondary tumors, slowed development of primary or secondary tumors, decreased occurrence of primary or secondary tumors, slowed or decreased severity of secondary effects of disease, arrested tumor growth and regression of tumors, among others. In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention.</p><p>"NAAG" refers to N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate, an important peptide component of the brain, with levels comparable to the major inhibitor neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). NAAG is neuron-specific, present in synaptic vesicles and released upon neuronal stimulation in several systems presumed to be glutamatergic. Studies suggest that NAAG may function as a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in the central nervous system, or as a precursor of the neurotransmitter glutamate.</p><p>"NAALADase" refers to N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase, a membrane-bound metallopeptidase which catabolizes NAAG to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate: ##STR2##</p><p>NAALADase shows a high affinity for NAAG with a Km of 540 nM. If NAAG is a bioactive peptide, then NAALADase may serve to inactivate NAAG'S synaptic action. Alternatively, if NAAG functions as a precursor for glutamate, the primary function of NAALADase may be to regulate synaptic glutamate availability.</p><p>"Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt of the inventive compounds which possesses the desired pharmacological activity and which is neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable. The salt can be formed with inorganic acids such as acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Examples of a base salt include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine and lysine. The basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quarternized with agents including lower alkyl halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates such as dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aralkyl halides such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides.</p><p>The term "prevention", in relation to tumor growth or tumor cell growth, means no tumor or tumor cell growth if none had occurred, no further tumor or tumor cell growth if there had already been growth.</p><p>The term "prostate disease" relates to prostate cancer such as adenocarcinoma or metastatic cancers, conditions characterized by abnormal growth of prostatic epithelial cells such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, and other conditions requiring treatment by the compounds of the present invention.</p><p>"PSA" refers to Prostate Specific Antigen, a well known prostate cancer marker. It is a protein produced by prostate cells and is frequently present at elevated levels in the blood of men with prostate cancer.

Alternatively, the compounds can be formulated into suitable lotions or creams containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl ester wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.</p><p>Topical application to the lower intestinal tract can be effected in rectal suppository formulations (see above) or in suitable enema formulations.</p><p>The compounds of the present invention may be administered by a single dose, multiple discrete doses or continuous infusion. Since the compounds are small, easily diffusible and relatively stable, they are well suited to continuous infusion. Pump means, particularly subcutaneous pump means, are preferred for continuous infusion.</p><p>Compositions and methods of the invention also may utilize controlled release technology. Thus, for example, NAALADase inhibitors may be incorporated into a polymer matrix for controlled release over a period of days. Such controlled release films are well known to the art. Examples of polymers commonly employed for this purpose that may be used in the present invention include nondegradable ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers. Certain hydrogels such as poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate) or poly(vinylalcohol) also may be useful.</p><heading>Dosage</heading><p>Dose levels on the order of about 0.1 mg to about 10,000 mg of the active ingredient compound are useful in the treatment of the above conditions, with preferred levels being about 0.1 mg to about 1,000 mg. The specific dose level for any particular patient will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the rate of excretion; drug combination; the severity of the particular disease being treated; and the form of administration. Typically, in vitro dosage-effect results provide useful guidance on the proper doses for patient administration. Studies in animal models are also helpful, particularly in determining effective doses for treating cancer. The considerations for determining the proper dose levels are well known in the art.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are administered in lyophilized form. In this case, 1 to 100 mg of a compound of the present invention may be lyophilized in individual vials, together with a carrier and a buffer, such as mannitol and sodium phosphate. The compound may be reconstituted in the vials with bacteriostatic water before administration.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the compounds of the present invention may be administered in combination with one or more therapeutic agents, including chemotherapeutic agents. TABLE I provides known median dosages for selected chemotherapeutic agents. Specific dose levels for these agents will depend upon considerations such as those identified above for the compounds of the present invention.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE I______________________________________CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT                 MEDIAN DOSAGE______________________________________Asparaginase          10,000 unitsBleomycin Sulfate     15 unitsCarboplatin           50-450 mgCarmustine            100 mgCisplatin             10-50 mgCladribine            10 mgCyclophosphamide      100 mg-2 gm(lyophilized)Cyclophosphamide (non-                 100 mg-2 gmlyophilized)Cytarabine (lyophilized                 100 mg-2 gmpowder)Dacarbazine           100 mg-200 mgDactinomycin          0.5 mgDaunorubicin          20 mgDiethylstilbestrol    250 mgDoxorubicin           10-150 mgEtidronate            300 mgEtoposide             100 mgFloxuridine           500 mgFludarabine Phosphate 50 mgFluorouracil          500 mg-5 gmGoserelin             3.6 mgGranisetron Hydrochloride                 1 mgIdarubicin            5-10 mgIfosfamide            1-3 gmLeucovorin Calcium    50-350 mgLeuprolide            3.75-7.5 mgMechlorethamine       10 mgMedroxyprogesterone   1 gmMelphalan             50 gmMethotrexate          20 mg-1 gmMitomycin             5-40 mgMitoxantrone          20-30 mgOndansetron Hydrochloride                 40 mgPaclitaxel            30 mgPamidronate Disodium  30-*90 mgPegaspargase          750 unitsPlicamycin            2,500 mcgmStreptozocin          1 gmThiotepa              15 mgTeniposide            50 mgVinblastine           10 mgVincristine           1-5 mgAldesleukin           22 million unitsEpoetin Alfa          2,000-10,000 unitsFilgrastim            300-480 mcgmImmune Globulin       500 mg-10 gmInterferon Alpha-2a   3-36 million unitsInterferon Alpha-2b   3-50 million unitsLevamisole            50 mgOctreotide            1,000-5,000 mcgmSargramostim          250-500 mcgm______________________________________</pre></p><heading>Administration regimen</heading><p>For the methods of the present invention, any administration regimen regulating the timing and sequence of drug delivery can be used and repeated as necessary to effect treatment. Such regimen may include pretreatment and/or co-administration with additional therapeutic agents.</p><p>For patients with prostate cancer that is neither advanced nor metastatic, the compounds of the present invention may be administered (i) prior to surgery or radiation treatment to reduce the risk of metastasis; (ii) during surgery or in conjunction with radiation treatment; and/or (iii) after surgery or radiation therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and to inhibit the growth of any residual tumorous cells.</p><p>For patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, the compounds of the present invention may be administered as a continuous supplement to, or as a replacement for, hormonal ablation in order to slow tumor cell growth in both the untreated primary tumor and the existing metastatic lesions.</p><p>The methods of the present invention are particularly useful where shed cells could not be removed by surgical intervention. After post-surgical recovery, the methods of the present invention would be effective in reducing the chances of recurrence of a tumor engendered by such shed cells.</p><heading>Combination with Other Treatments</heading><p>(i) Surgery and Radiation Treatment</p><p>In general, surgery and radiation treatment are employed as potentially curative therapies for patients with localized prostate cancer who are under 70 years of age and are expected to live at least 10 more years.</p><p>Approximately 70% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients fall into this category. Approximately 90% of these patients (65% of total patients) undergo surgery, while approximately 10% of these patients (7% of total patients) undergo radiation treatment.</p><p>Histopathological examination of surgical specimens reveals that approximately 63% of patients undergoing surgery (40% of total patients) have locally extensive tumors or regional (lymph node) metastasis that was undetected at initial diagnosis. These patients are at a significantly greater risk of recurrence. Approximately 40% of these patients will actually develop recurrence within five years after surgery. Results after radiation treatment are even less encouraging. Approximately 80% of patients who have undergone radiation treatment as their primary therapy have disease persistence or develop recurrence or metastasis within five years after treatment.</p><p>Currently, most prostate cancer patients undergoing surgery and radiation treatment do not receive any immediate follow-up therapy. Rather, they are monitored frequently for elevated Prostate Specific Antigen ("PSA"), which is the primary indicator of recurrence or metastasis.</p><p>Based on the above statistics, there is considerable opportunity to use the present invention in conjunction with surgery and/or radiation treatment.</p><p>(ii) Hormonal Therapy</p><p>Hormonal ablation is the most effective palliative treatment for the 10% of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Hormonal ablation by medication and/or orchiectomy is used to block hormones that promote further growth and metastasis of prostate cancer. With time, both the primary and metastatic tumors of virtually all of these patients become hormone-independent and resistant to therapy. Approximately 50% of patients with metastatic cancer die within three years after initial diagnosis, and 75% of such patients die within five years after diagnosis. Continuous supplementation with the compounds of the present invention may be used to prevent or reverse this potentially metastasis-permissive state.</p><p>(iii) Chemotherapy</p><p>While chemotherapy has been successful in treating some forms of cancer, it has shown slight therapeutic value in treating prostate cancer where it is generally reserved as a last resort. Accordingly, the opportunity to treat prostate cancer by combining chemotherapy with the methods of the present invention will be rare. When combined, however, such treatments should be more effective than chemotherapy alone in controlling prostate cancer.</p><p>(iv) Immunotherapy</p><p>The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with monoclonal antibodies to treat prostate cancer. Such combined treatment is particularly effective for patients with pelvic lymph node involvement, of which only 34% survive after 5 years. An example of such monoclonal antibodies is cell membrane-specific anti-prostate antibody.</p><p>The present invention may also be used with immunotherapies based on polyclonal or monoclonal antibody-derived reagents. Monoclonal antibody-derived reagents are preferred. These reagents are well known in the art, and include radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies conjugated with strontium-89.</p><p>(v) Cryotherapy</p><p>The methods of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with cryotherapy for treatment of prostate cancer.</p><heading>Experimental Studies</heading><p>The following experimental studies of compounds of the present invention and of structurally related compounds provide strong evidence that the compounds of the present invention are non-toxic and are effective in inhibiting NAALADase activity, treating glutamate abnormalities and treating prostate diseases.</p><heading>In Vivo Toxicity of NAALADase Inhibitors</heading><p>To examine the toxicological effect of NAALADase inhibition in vivo, a group of mice were injected with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid, a structurally related NAALADase inhibitor of high activity, in doses of 1, 5, 10, 30, 100, 300 and 500 mg/kg body weight. The mice were subsequently observed two times per day for 5 consecutive days. The survival rate at each dose level is provided in TABLE II below. The results show that the NAALADase inhibitor is non-toxic to mice, suggesting that the compounds of the present invention would be similarly non-toxic to humans when administered at therapeutically effective amounts.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE II______________________________________TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NAALADASE INHIBITORS______________________________________Dose    1       5      10    30   100   300  500(mg/kg)______________________________________Survival   100     100    100   100  100   100  66.7Rate After5 days (%)______________________________________</pre></p><heading>In Vitro Assay of NAALADase Activity</heading><p>The following structurally related compounds were tested for in vitro inhibition of NAALADase activity.
