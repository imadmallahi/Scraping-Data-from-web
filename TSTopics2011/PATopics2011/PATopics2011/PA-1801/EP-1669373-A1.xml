Early on it was recognized that either blending such resins or the use of different metallocene catalyst, in the same reactor could produce bimodal resins, each component having a narrow polydispersity and the blend having a broader polydispersity. It was felt such resins would provide a good balance of processability and physical properties such as resin toughness. There are an increasing number of patents and applications in this field.</p><p num="p0003">United States Patent 4,530,914 issued July 23, 1985 to Ewen et al., assigned to EXXON Research &amp; Engineering Co. teaches the use in the same reactor of two metallocene catalysts each having different propagation and termination rate constants for ethylene polymerizations. The catalyst combination taught in the patent is not the same as that contemplated by the present invention.</p><p num="p0004">There are a number of patents wherein a bimodal resin is produced having a controlled molecular weight distribution by using different single site catalysts such as metallocenes in two or more tandem reactors. United States patent application 2002/0045711 in the name of Backman et<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> al., published April 18, 2002 is illustrative of this type of art.

The patent does not teach the use of mixed catalysts systems for bimodal resins nor does it teach process control to adjust the polymer characteristics such as bimodality and comonomer incorporation.</p><p num="p0006">United States patent application 2002/0077431 published June 20, 2002 in the name of Whiteker discloses a process for the polymerization and oligomerization of olefins in the presence of a mixed catalyst system in a single reactor.
