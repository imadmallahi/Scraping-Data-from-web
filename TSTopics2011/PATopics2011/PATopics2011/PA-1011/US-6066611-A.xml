These stains are typically associated with lipid and protein soils. The enzymes, however, have proven less effective against other types of soils and stains.</p><p>It has also long been known that peroxygen bleaches are effective for stain and/or soil removal from fabrics, but that such bleaches are temperature dependent. At a laundry liquor temperature of 60 bleaches are only partially effective. As the laundry liquor temperature is lowered below 60 ineffective. As a consequence, there has been a substantial amount of industrial research to develop effective bleaching systems.</p><p>By the present invention, it has been discovered that the combination of novel protease enzymes which are carbonyl hydrolase variants and bleaching agents, especially bleach activators, provide effective stain removal and/or dingy cleanup benefits. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide bleaching compositions, especially laundry detergent compositions, having improved stain removal and/or dingy cleanup benefits and/or fabric cleaning benefits and/or bleaching properties.</p><p>These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the detailed description hereinafter.</p><heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading><p>U.S. Pat.

See E.P. Patent 341,947, Lagerwaard, et al, published Nov. 15, 1989 for a discussion of the compatibility problems of lipase enzymes with certain bleaching systems. U.S. Pat.

The method can be carried out at temperatures below about 60 at laundry temperatures up to the boil. The aqueous laundry liquor preferably comprises at least about 300 ppm of conventional detergent ingredients, as well as at least about 25 ppm of bleach activator and at least about 25 ppm of bleaching compound. Preferably, said aqueous liquor comprises from about 900 ppm to about 20,000 ppm of the conventional detergent ingredients, from about 100 ppm to about 25,000 ppm of bleaching compound and from about 100 ppm to about 2,500 ppm of said bleach activator.</p><p>The conventional detergent ingredients employed in said method comprise from about 1% to about 99.8%, preferably from about 5% to about 80%, of a detersive surfactant. Optionally, detersive compositions can also comprise from about 5% to about 80% of a detergent builder. Other optional detersive ingredients are also encompassed by the fully-formulated detergent/bleach compositions provided by this invention.</p><p>All percentages, ratios and proportions are by weight, unless otherwise specified.

The bleaching systems in combination with the protease enzyme are particularly efficient at removing most types of soils from the fabrics, including protein and lipid soils, dingy soils, and heavy soil loads, especially from nucleophilic and body soils.</p><p>The protease enzymes, bleaching agents (including peroxyacids and bleaching systems) and cleaning composition materials useful herein, including preferred levels, are described in detail hereinafter.</p><p>(1) Bleaching Agent</p><p>The bleaching compositions herein contain a bleaching agent, which preferably comprises from about 0.5 to about 20 wt. % of the composition. The bleaching agent is either a substantially insoluble, preferably solid, organic peroxyacid, or a bleaching system comprising a bleach activator and a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide, or a combination of both. The peracid which is in the composition, or which is formed by the combination of activator and peroxygen compound, preferably has a corresponding carboxylic acid that has a Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance ("H.L.B.") value which ranges from about 3 to about 6.5. Therefore, a method that can be used to characterize the preferred peroxyacids (from activators or as preformed peroxyacids) which are useful in the present invention is the "H.L.B. Scale" such as that described in Davies, J. T., Proc 2nd Internat. Conqr. Surface Activity 1,. 426, Butterworths, London (1957), incorporated herein by reference. Such an H.L.B. Scale (Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance) has been used in the study of surface-active agents (surfactants) as a means to relate the distribution of a surface-active agent between a hydrophilic (water-like) and a lipophilic (oil-like) phase. In this manner, H.L.B. values can be used as an indication of the lipophilic (hydrophobic) character of the active bleaching species in the wash (i.e., the ability of the peroxyacid to partition out of the wash liquor and concentrate at the soil/fabric interface).</p><p>Set forth hereinafter in Table A are H.L.B. values which have been calculated for selected peroxyacids (as the corresponding carboxylic acids). The equation used to calculate the H.L.B. values can be set forth as:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->HLB=Sum (Hydrophilic Group Numbers)-Sum (Hydrophobic Group Numbers)+7.</pre></p><p>The values for the Hydrophilic Group Numbers are [--C(O)OH &amp;--N(H)C(O)--=2.1] and the values for the Hydrophobic Group Numbers are [aliphaticlaromatic carbon=0.475 &amp; aliphatic carbon atoms between polar groups are 1/2 the value of an aliphatic carbon in a hydrocarbon chain=(0.475)2/]. For reference, an H.L.B. value &amp;gt;7 indicates that the material is preferentially water soluble and an H.L.B. value &amp;lt;7 indicates increasing surface-activity and hydrophobicity.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE A______________________________________H.L.B.

The peroxyacid useful herein preferably comprises from about 0.5 to about 20, more preferably from about 1 to about 10, most preferably from about 2 to about 7, wt. % of the composition.</p><p>Preferred organic peroxyacids are selected from the group consisting of 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid; 6-(nonyl-amino)-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid; 1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid; heptyl sulfonylperpropionic acid; decylsulphonyl perpropionic acid; and heptyl-, octyl-, nonyl-, decyl-sulphonylperbutyric acid; and mixtures thereof.</p><p>Of the organic peroxyacids, amidoperoxyacids (amide substituted peroxycarboxylic acids) are preferred. Suitable amidoperoxyacids for use herein are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,634,551 and 4,686,063, both Burns et al., issued Jan. 6, 1987 and Aug. 11, 1987, respectively, both incorporated herein by reference. Suitable amidoperoxyacids are of the formula: ##STR1## wherein R.sup.1 is an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms (preferably R.sup.1 is an alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms), R.sup.2 is an alkylene, arylene or alkarylene group containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms (preferably R.sup.2 is an alkylene group containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms), and R.sup.5 is H or an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms (preferably R.sup.5 is H). More preferably, R.sup.1 is an alkyl group containing from about 8 to about 10 carbon atoms, and R.sup.2 is an alkylene group containing from about 2 to about 4 carbon atoms</p><p>Also suitable for use herein are peroxyfumarates, which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,852,989, Burns et al., issued Aug. 1, 1989, incorporated herein by reference, and sulfone peroxyacids (sulfone peroxycarboxylic acids), which are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,758,369, 4,824,591, and 5,004,558, all Dryoff et al., issued Jul. 19, 1988, Apr. 25, 1989, and Apr. 2, 1991, respectively, all incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Example I of U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,063 contains one description of the synthesis of NAPSA, from column 8, line 40 to column 9, line 5, and NAPAA, from column 9, line 15 to column 9, line 65. At the end of the amidoperoxyacid synthesis, the reaction is quenched with water, filtered, washed with water to remove some excess sulfuric acid (or other strong acid with which the peroxyacid was made), and filtered again.</p><p>The amidoperoxyacid wet cake thus obtained can be contacted with a phosphate buffer solution at a pH between about 3.5 and 6, preferably between about 4 and 5, according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,953, Sadlowski et al., issued Mar. 20, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Other agents for storage stabilization or exotherm control can be added to the amidoperoxyacid before incorporation into the final product. For example, boric acid, an exotherm control agent disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,063, Burns, issued Aug. 11, 1987 and incorporated herein, can be mixed with the amidoperoxyacid (which has been washed in phosphate buffer) in about a 2:1 peracid:boric acid ratio. The phosphate buffer washed amidoperoxyacid can also be mixed with appropriate amounts of dipicolinic acid and tetrasodium pyrophosphate, a chelating stabilization system. Chelants can optionally be included in the phosphate buffer before contact with the wet cake.</p><p>The wet cake is preferably made up of particles with an average particle diameter of from about 0.1 to about 260 microns, preferably from about 10 to about 100 microns, and most preferably from about 30 to about 60 microns. Small particle size NAPAA crystals are desired herein. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,218, Getty et al., issued Oct. 8, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>NAPAA filter cake herein is preferably washed twice in phosphate buffer. It has been found that two successive phosphate buffer washes lend optimal stability to NAPAA.</p><p>Particulate (solid), organic peroxyacids with a theoretical AvO (available oxygen) of between about 3 and about 12, most preferably between 5 and 7, are preferred.</p><p>Most preferred for use herein is NAPAA. Another name for the nonylamide of peroxyadipic acid ("NAPAA") is 6-(nonylamino)-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid. The chemical formula for NAPAA is: ##STR2## The molecular weight of NAPAA is 287.4.</p><p>Detergent compositions and bleaching compositions containing NAPAA provide extremely effective and efficient surface bleaching of textiles. Stains andlor soils are removed from the textiles. These compositions are particularly effective at removing dingy soils from textiles.</p><p>NAPAA's polar amide or substituted amide moiety results in a peroxyacid which has a very low vapor pressure and thus possesses a low odor profile as well as excellent bleaching performance. It is believed that the polarity of the amide group results in a reduction of vapor pressure of the peroxyacid, and an increase in melting point.</p><p>NAPAA can be used directly as a bleaching agent. It has a reduced vapor pressure and a good odor profile in laundry applications.</p><p>NAPAA can be prepared by, for example, first reacting NAAA (monononyl amide of adipic acid), sulfuric acid, and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction product is quenched by addition to ice water followed by filtration, washing with distilled water, and final suction filtration to recover the wet cake. Washing can be continued until the pH of the filtrate is neutral.</p><p>It is also preferred that the NAPAA pH (10% solids in water) be between about 4.2 and 4.8. Surprisingly, this pH results in more thermally stable particles.</p><p>(b) bleaching Systems--Bleach Activator and Peroxygen Bleaching Compound</p><p>(i) Bleach Activators</p><p>The bleach activator for the bleaching systems useful herein preferably has the following structure: ##STR3## wherein R is an alkyl group containing from about 5 to about 18 carbon atoms wherein the longest linear alkyl chain extending from and including the carbonyl carbon contains from about 6 to about 10 carbon atoms and L is a leaving group, the conjugate acid of which has a pKa in the range of from about 4 to about 13, preferably from about 6 to about 11, most preferably from about 8 to about 11.</p><p>L can be essentially any suitable leaving group. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydroxide anion. This, the perhydrolysis reaction, results in the formation of the percarboxylic acid. Generally, for a group to be a suitable leaving group it must exert an electron attracting effect. This facilitates the nucleophilic attach by the perhydroxide anion.</p><p>The L group must be sufficiently reactive for the reaction to occur within the optimum time frame (e.g., a wash cycle). However, if L is too reactive, this activator will be difficult to stabilize. These characteristics are generally paralleled by the pKa of the conjugate acid of the leaving group, although exceptions to this convention are known.</p><p>Preferred bleach activators are those of the general formula: ##STR4## wherein R.sup.1 is an alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms, R.sup.2 is an alkylene containing from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, R.sup.5 is H or alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, and L is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR5## wherein R.sup.6 is an alkylene, arylene, or alkarylene group containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, R.sup.3 is an alkyl chain containing from about 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, R.sup.4 is H or R.sup.3, and Y is H or a solubilizing group.

Preferably, M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred, and X is an anion selected from the group consisting of halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate and acetate anions. More preferably, Y is --SO.sub.3 --M+ and --COO--M+. It should be noted that bleach activators with a leaving group that does not contain a solubilizing group should be well dispersed in the bleach solution in order to assist in their dissolution. Preferred is: ##STR6## wherein R.sup.3 is as defined above and Y is --SO.sub.3 --M+ or --COO--M+ wherein M is as defined above.</p><p>Especially preferred bleach activators are those wherein R.sup.1 is a linear alkyl chain containing from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms, R.sup.2 is a linear alkylene chain containing from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, R.sup.5 is H, and L is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR7## wherein R.sup.3 is as defined above, Y is --SO.sub.3 --M+ or --COO--M+ and M is as defined above.</p><p>A preferred bleach activator is: ##STR8## wherein R is H, alkyl, aryl or alkaryl. This is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,966,723, Hodge et al., incorporated by reference herein.</p><p>Preferred bleach activators are: ##STR9## wherein R.sup.1 is H or an alkyl group containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms and R.sup.2 is an alkyl group containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms and L is as defined above.</p><p>Preferred bleach activators are also those of the above general formula wherein L is as defined in the general formula, and R.sup.1 is H or an alkyl group containing from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms.</p><p>Even more preferred are bleach activators of the above general formula wherein L is as defined in the general formula and R.sup.1 is a H.</p><p>More preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R is a linear alkyl chain containing from about 5 to about 9 and preferably from about 6 to about 8 carbon atoms and L is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR10## wherein R, R.sup.2 R.sup.3 and Y are as defined above.</p><p>Particularly preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R is an alkyl group containing from about 5 to about 12 carbon atoms wherein the longest linear portion of the alkyl chain extending from and including the carbonyl carbon is from about 6 to about 10 carbon atoms, and L is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR11## wherein R.sup.2 is an alkyl chain containing from about 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, and Y is --SO--.sub.3 M+ or --COO--M+ wherein M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation.</p><p>Especially preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R is a linear alkyl chain containing from about 5 to about 9 and preferably from about 6 to about 8 carbon atoms and L is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR12## wherein R.sup.2 is as defined above and Y is --SO--.sub.3 M+ or --COO--M+ wherein M is as defined above.</p><p>The most preferred bleach activators have the formula: ##STR13## wherein R is a linear alkyl chain containing from about 5 to about 9 and preferably from about 6 to about 8 carbon atoms and M is sodium or potassium.</p><p>Preferably, the bleach activator herein is sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS) or sodium benzoyloxybenzenesulfonate (BOBS).</p><p>Further particularly preferred for use in the present invention bleaching compositions are the following bleach activators which are particularly safe for use with machines having natural rubber parts. This is believed to be the result of not producing oily diacylperoxide (DAP) species by the perhydrolysis reaction of these amido acid-derived bleach activators, but rather forming insoluble crystalline solid DAP's. These solids are believed to not form a coating film and thus natural rubber parts are not exposed to DAP's for extended periods of time. These preferred bleach activators are members selected from the group consisting of:</p><p>a) a bleach activator of the general formula: ##STR14##  or mixtures thereof, wherein R.sup.1 is an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, R.sup.2 is an alkylene, arylene or alkarylene group containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, R.sup.5 is H or an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, and L is a leaving group;</p><p>b) benzoxazin-type bleach activators of the general formula: ##STR15##  wherein R.sub.1 is H, alky, alkaryl, aryl, arylalkyl, and wherein R.sub.2, R.sub.3, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 may be the same or different substituents selected from H, halogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, amino, alkylamino, COOR.sub.6 (wherein R.sub.6 is H or an alkyl group) and carbonyl functions;</p><p>c) N-acyl caprolactam bleach activators of the formula: ##STR16##  wherein R.sup.6 is H or an alkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 12 carbons; and</p><p>d) mixtures of a), b) and c).</p><p>Preferred bleach activators of type a) are those wherein R.sup.1 is an alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms, R.sup.2 contains from about 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, and R.sup.5 is H or methyl. Particularly preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formulas wherein R.sup.1 is an alkyl group containing from about 7 to about 10 carbon atoms and R.sup.2 contains from about 4 to about 5 carbon atoms.</p><p>Preferred bleach activators of type b) are those wherein R.sub.2, R.sub.3, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 are H and R.sub.1 is a phenyl group.</p><p>The preferred acyl moieties of said N-acyl caprolactam bleach activators of type c) have the formula R.sup.6 --CO-- wherein R.sup.6 is H or an alkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl, or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 12 carbons, preferably from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. In highly preferred embodiments, R.sup.6 is a member selected from the group consisting of phenyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl, decenyl and mixtures thereof.</p><p>Amido Derived Bleach Activators--The bleach activators of type a) employed in the present invention are amide substituted compounds of the general formulas: ##STR17## or mixtures thereof, wherein R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are as defined above and L can be essentially any suitable leaving group. Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and R.sup.5 are as defined for the peroxyacid and L is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR18## and mixtures thereof, wherein R.sup.1 is an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, R.sup.3 is an alkyl chain containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, R.sup.4 is H or R.sup.3, and Y is H or a solubilizing group.</p><p>The preferred solubilizing groups are --SO.sub.3.sup.- M.sup.+, --CO.sub.2.sup.- M.sup.+, --SO.sub.4.sup.- M.sup.+, --N.sup.+ (R.sup.3).sub.4 X.sup.-  and O&amp;lt;N(R.sup.3).sub.3 and most preferably --SO.sub.3.sup.- M.sup.+  and --CO.sub.2.sup.- M.sup.+  wherein R.sup.3 is an alkyl chain containing from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, M is a cation which provides solubility to the bleach activator and X is an anion which provides solubility to the bleach activator. Preferably, M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred, and X is a halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate anion. It should be noted that bleach activators with a leaving group that does not contain a solubilizing groups should be well dispersed in the bleaching solution in order to assist in their dissolution.</p><p>Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein L is selected from the group consisting of: ##STR19## wherein R.sup.3 is as defined above and Y is --SO.sub.3.sup.- M.sup.+  or --CO.sub.2.sup.- M.sup.+  wherein M is as defined above.</p><p>Another important class of bleach activators, including those of type b) and type c), provide organic peracids as described herein by ring-opening as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the cyclic ring by the perhydroxide anion. For instance, this ring-opening reaction in type c) activators involves attack at the caprolactam ring carbonyl by hydrogen peroxide or its anion. Since attack of an acyl caprolactam by hydrogen peroxide or its anion occurs preferably at the exocyclic carbonyl, obtaining a significant fraction of ring-opening may require a catalyst. Another example of ring-opening bleach activators can be found in type b) activators, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,966,723, Hodge et al, issued Oct. 30, 1990.</p><p>Benzoxazin-type Bleach Activators--Such activator compounds disclosed by Hodge include the activators of the benzoxazin-type, having the formula: ##STR20## including the substituted benzoxazins of the type ##STR21## wherein R.sub.1 is H, alkyl, alkaryl, aryl, arylalkyl, and wherein R.sub.2, R.sub.3, R.sub.4, and R.sub.5 may be the same or different substituents selected from H, halogen, alky, alkenyl, aryl, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, amino, alkyl amino, COOR.sub.6 (wherein R.sub.6 is H or an alkyl group) and carbonyl functions.</p><p>A preferred activator of the benzoxazin-type is: ##STR22##</p><p>When the activators are used, optimum surface bleaching performance is obtained with washing solutions wherein the pH of such solution is between about 8.5 and 10.5 and preferably between 9.5 and 10.5 in order to facilitate the perhydrolysis reaction. Such pH can be obtained with substances commonly known as buffering agents, which are optional components of the bleaching systems herein.</p><p>N-Acyl Carrolactam Bleach Activators--The N-acyl caprolactam bleach activators of type c) employed in the present invention have the formula: ##STR23## wherein R.sup.6 is H or an alkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl, or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 12 carbons. Caprolactam activators wherein the R.sup.6 moiety contains at least about 6, preferably from 6 to about 12, carbon atoms provide hydrophobic bleaching which affords nucleophilic and body soil clean-up, as noted above. Caprolactam activators wherein R.sup.6 comprises from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms provide hydrophilic bleaching species which are particularly efficient for bleaching beverage stains. Mixtures of hydrophobic and hydrophilic caprolactams, typically at weight ratios of 1:5 to 5:1, preferably 1:1, can be used herein for mixed stain removal benefits.</p><p>Highly preferred N-acyl caprolactams are selected from the group consisting of benzoyl caprolactam, octanoyl caprolactam, nonanoyl caprolactam, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl caprolactam, decanoyl caprolactam, undecenoyl caprolactam, and mixtures thereof. Methods for making N-acyl caprolactams are well known in the art.</p><p>Contrary to the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,784, the bleach activator is preferably not absorbed onto the peroxygen bleaching compound. To do so in the presence of other organic detersive ingredients could cause safety problems.</p><p>The bleach activators of type a), b) or c) will comprise at least about 0.1%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 50%, more preferably from about 1% to about 30%, most preferably from about 3% to about 25%, by weight of bleaching system or detergent composition.</p><p>The preferred amidoderived and caprolactam bleach activators herein can also be used in combination with rubber-safe, enzyme-safe, hydrophilic activators such as TAED, typically at weight ratios of amido-derived or caprolactam activators:TAED in the range of 1:5 to 5:1, preferably about 1:1.</p><p>The bleaching mechanism generally, and the surface bleaching mechanism in particular, are not completely understood. However, it is generally believed that the bleach activator undergoes nucleophilic attack by a perhydroxide anion, which is generated from the hydrogen peroxide evolved by the peroxygen bleach, to form a peroxycarboxylic acid. This reaction is commonly referred to as perhydrolysis.</p><p>When the activators are used, optimum surface bleaching performance is obtained with washing solutions wherein the pH of such solution is between about 8.5 and 10.5 and preferably between 9.5 and 10.5 in order to facilitate the perhydrolysis reaction. Such pH can be obtained with substances commonly known as buffering agents, which are optional components of the bleaching systems herein.</p><p>(ii) The Peroxygen Bleaching Compound</p><p>The peroxygen bleaching systems useful herein are those capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous liquor.

Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate. Percarbonate is especially preferred because it is very stable during storage and yet still dissolves very quickly in the bleaching liquor. It is believed that such rapid dissolution results in the formation of higher levels of percarboxylic acid and, thus, enhanced surface bleaching performance.</p><p>Highly preferred percarbonate can be in uncoated or coated form. The average particle size of uncoated percarbonate ranges from about 400 to about 1200 microns, most preferably from about 400 to about 600 microns. If coated percarbonate is used, the preferred coating materials include mixtures of carbonate and sulphate, silicate, borosilicate, or fatty carboxylic acids.</p><p>The peroxygen bleaching compound will comprise at least about 0.1%, preferably from about 1% to about 75%, more preferably from about 3% to about 40%, most preferably from about 3% to about 25%, by weight of bleaching system or detergent composition.</p><p>The weight ratio of bleach activator to peroxygen bleaching compound in the bleaching system typically ranges from about 2:1 to 1:5.

Preferably, the bleaching compositions herein comprise from about 0.5 to about 20, most preferably from about 1 to about 10, wt. % of the peroxygen bleaching compound.</p><p>The bleach activatoribleaching compound systems herein are useful per se as bleaches. However, such bleaching systems are especially useful in compositions which can comprise various detersive adjuncts such as surfactants, builders and the like.</p><p>(2) Protease Enzymes:</p><p>The invention includes protease enzymes which are non-naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolase variants having a different proteolytic activity, stability, substrate specificity, pH profile and/or performance characteristic as compared to the precursor carbonyl hydrolase from which the amino acid sequence of the variant is derived.

Specifically, such carbonyl hydrolase variants have an amino acid sequence not found in nature, which is derived by replacement of a plurality of amino acid residues of a precursor carbonyl hydrolase with different amino acids. The plurality of amino acid residues of the precursor enzyme correspond to position +76 in combination with one or more of the following residues +99, +101, +103, +104, +107, +123, +27, +105, +109, +126, +128, +135, +156, +166, +195, +197, +204, +206, +210, +216, +217, +218, +222, +260, +265, and/or +274, where the numbered position corresponds to naturally-occurring subtilisin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens or to equivalent amino acid residues in other carbonyl hydrolases or subtilisins, such as Bacillus lentus subtilisin.</p><p>The carbonyl hydrolase variants which are protease enzyme useful in the present invention compositions comprise replacement of amino acid residue +76 in combination with one or more additional modifications.

Although the amino acid residues identified for modification herein are identified according to the numbering applicable to B. amylotiquefaciens (which has become the conventional method for identifying residue positions in all subtilisins), the preferred precursor DNA sequence useful for the present invention is the DNA sequence of Bacillus lentus as shown in FIG. 6 (Seq.

Preferably the variant DNA sequences encode the substitution or insertion of amino acid residues in the following combinations: 76/99; 76/101; 76/103; 76/104; 76/107; 76/123; 76/99/101; 76/99/103; 76/99/104; 76/101/103; 76/101/104; 76/103/104; 76/104/107; 76/104/123; 76/107/123; 76/99/101/103; 76/99/101/134; 76/99/103/104; 76/101/103/104; 76/103/104/123; 76/104/107/123; 76/99/101/103/104; 76/99/103/104/123; 76/99/101/103/104/123; 76/103/104/128; 76/103/104/260; 76/103/104/265; 76/103/104/197; 76/103/104/105; 76/103/104/135; 76/103/104/126; 76/103/104/107; 76/103/104/210; 76/103/104/126/265; and/or 76/103/104/222. Most preferably the variant DNA sequences encode for the modification of the following combinations of residues: 76/99; 76/104; 76/99/104; 76/103/104; 76/104/107; 76/101/103/104; 76/99/101/103/104 and 76/101/104. These recombinant DNA sequences encode carbonyl hydrolase variants having a novel amino acid sequence and, in general, at least one property which is substantially different from the same property of the enzyme encoded by the precursor carbonyl hydrolase DNA sequence. Such properties include proteolytic activity, substrate specificity, stability, altered pH profile and/or enhanced performance characteristics.</p><p>The protease enzymes useful herein encompass the substitution of any of the nineteen naturally occurring L-amino acids at the designated amino acid residue positions.

They include naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolases and recombinant carbonyl hydrolases. Naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolases principally include hydrolases, e.g., peptide hydrolases such as subtilisins or metalloproteases. Peptide hydrolases include α-aminoacylpeptide hydrolase, peptidylamino acid hydrolase, acylamino hydrolase, serine carboxypeptidase, metallocarboxypeptidase, thiol proteinase, carboxylproteinase and metalloproteinase. Serine, metallo, thiol and acid proteases are included, as well as endo and exo-proteases.</p><p>"Recombinant carbonyl hydrolase" refers to a carbonyl hydrolase in which the DNA sequence encoding the naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolase is modified to produce a mutant DNA sequence which encodes the substitution, insertion or deletion of one or more amino acids in the carbonyl hydrolase amino acid sequence. Suitable modification methods are disclosed herein, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,025 (RE 34,606), U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,015 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,258, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Subtilisins are bacterial or fungal carbonyl hydrolases which generally act to cleave peptide bonds of proteins or peptides. As used herein, "subtilisin" means a naturally-occurring subtilisin or a recombinant subtilisin. A series of naturally-occurring subtilisins is known to be produced and often secreted by various microbial species. Amino acid sequences of the members of this series are not entirely homologous. However, the subtilisins in this series exhibit the same or similar type of proteolytic activity. This class of serine proteases shares a common amino acid sequence defining a catalytic triad which distinguishes them from the chymotrypsin related class of serine proteases. The subtilisins and chymotrypsin related serine proteases both have a catalytic triad comprising aspartate, histidine and serine. In the subtilisin related proteases the relative order of these amino acids, reading from the amino to carboxy terminus, is aspartate-histidine-serine. In the chymotrypsin related proteases the relative order, however, is histidine-aspartate-serine. Thus, subtilisin herein refers to a serine protease having the catalytic triad of subtilisin related proteases. Examples include but are not limited to the subtilisins identified in FIG. 3 herein.</p><p>"Recombinant subtilisin" refers to a subtilisin in which the DNA sequence encoding the subtilisin is modified to produce a variant (or mutant) DNA sequence which encodes the substitution, deletion or insertion of one or more amino acids in the naturally-occurring subtilisin amino acid sequence. Suitable methods to produce such modification, and which may be combined with those disclosed herein, include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,025 (RE 34,606), U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,015 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,258.</p><p>"Non-human carbonyl hydrolases" and the DNA encoding them may be obtained from many procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms. Suitable examples of procaryotic organisms include gram negative organisms such as E. coli or Pseudomonas and gram positive bacteria such as Micrococcus or Bacilfus. Examples of eucaryotic organisms from which carbonyl hydrolase and their genes may be obtained include yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fungi such as Aspergillus sp. and non-human mammalian sources such as, for example, bovine sp. from which the gene encoding the carbonyl hydrolase chymosin can be obtained. As with subtilisins, a series of carbonyl hydrolases can be obtained from various related species which have amino acid sequences which are not entirely homologous between the members of that series but which nevertheless exhibit the same or similar type of biological activity. Thus, non-human carbonyl hydrolase as used herein has a functional definition which refers to carbonyl hydrolases which are associated, directly or indirectly, with procaryotic and eucaryotic sources.</p><p>A "carbonyl hydrolase variant" has an amino acid sequence which is derived from the amino acid sequence of a "precursor carbonyl hydrolase." The precursor carbonyl hydrolases (such as a subtilisin) include naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolases (subtilisin) and recombinant carbonyl hydrolases (subtilisin). The amino acid sequence of the carbonyl hydrolase variant is "derived" from the precursor hydrolase amino acid sequence by the substitution, deletion or insertion of one or more amino acids of the precursor amino acid sequence. Such modification is of the "precursor DNA sequence" which encodes the amino acid sequence of the precursor carbonyl hydrolase (subtilisin) rather than manipulation of the precursor carbonyl hydrolase (subtilisin) enzyme per se. Suitable methods for such manipulation of the precursor DNA sequence include methods disclosed herein, as well as methods known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, EP 0 328299, WO89/06279 and the U.S. patents and applications already referenced herein).</p><p>Specific residues corresponding to position +76 in combination with one or more of the following positions +99, +101, +103, +104, +107, +123, +27, +105, +109, +126, +128, +135, +156, +166, +195, +197, +204, +206, +210, +216, +217, +218, +222, +260, +265 and/or +274 of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin are identified herein for mutation. Preferably the modified residues are selected from the following combinations: 76/99; 76/101; 76/103; 76/104; 76/107; 76/123; 76/99/101; 76/99/103; 76/99/104; 76/101/103; 76/101/104; 76/103/104; 76/104/107; 76/104/123; 76/107/123; 76/99/101/103; 76/99/101/104; 76/99/103/104; 76/101/103/104; 76/103/104/123; 76/104/107/123; 76/99/101/103/104; 76/99/103/104/123; 76/99/101/103/104/123; 76/103/104/128; 76/103/1041260; 76/103/104/265; 76/103/104/197; 76/103/104/105; 76/103/1041/135; 76/103/104/126; 76/103/104/107; 76/103/104/210; 76/103/104/126/265; and/or 76/103/104/222; and most preferably are 76/99; 76/104; 76/991104; 76/103/104; 76/104/107; 76/101/103/104; 76/99/101/103/104 and 76/101/104. These amino acid position numbers refer to those assigned to the mature Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin sequence presented in FIG. 1. The protease enzymes useful in the present invention, however, are not limited to the mutation of this particular subtilisin but extends to precursor carbonyl hydrolases containing amino acid residues at positions which are "equivalent" to the particular identified residues in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. Preferably, the precursor subtilisin is Bacillus lentus subtilisin and the substitutions, deletions or insertions are made at the equivalent amino acid residue in B. lentus corresponding to those listed above.</p><p>A residue (amino acid) of a precursor carbonyl hydrolase is equivalent to a residue of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin if it is either homologous (i.e., corresponding in position in either primary or tertiary structure) or analogous to a specific residue or portion of that residue in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin (i.e., having the same or similar functional capacity to combine, react, or interact chemically).</p><p>In order to establish homology to primary structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor carbonyl hydrolase is directly compared to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin primary sequence and particularly to a set of residues known to be invariant in subtilisins for which sequence is known. FIG. 2 herein shows the conserved residues as between amyloliquefaciens subtilisin and B. lentus subtilisin. After aligning the conserved residues, allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues. Conservation of the catalytic triad, Asp32/His64/Ser221 should be maintained.</p><p>For example, in FIG. 3 the amino acid sequence of subtilisin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis (cardsbergensis) and Bacillus lentus are aligned to provide the maximum amount of homology between amino acid sequences. A comparison of these sequences shows that there are a number of conserved residues contained in each sequence. These conserved residues (as between BPN' and B. lentus) are identified in FIG. 2.</p><p>These conserved residues, thus, may be used to define the corresponding equivalent amino acid residues of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin in other carbonyl hydrolases such as subtilisin from Bacillus lentus (PCT Publication No. WO89106279 published Jul. 13, 1989), the preferred subtilisin precursor enzyme is herein, or the subtilisin referred to as PB92 (EP O 328 299), which is highly homologous to the preferred Bacillus lentus subtilisin. The amino acid sequences of certain of these subtilisins are aligned in FIGS. 3A and 3B with the sequence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin to produce the maximum homology of conserved residues. As can be seen, there are a number of deletions in the sequence of Bacllus lentus as compared to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. Thus, for example, the equivalent amino acid for Val165 in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin in the other subtilisins is isoleucine for B. lentus and B. licheniformis.</p><p>Thus, for example, the amino acid at position +76 is asparagine (N) in both B. amyloliquefaciens and B. lentus subtilisins. In the preferred subtilisin variant useful in the invention, however, the amino acid equivalent to +76 in Bacillus amyfoliquefaciens subtilisin is substituted with aspartate (D). A comparison of all the amino acid residues identified herein for substitution versus the preferred substitution for each such position is provided in Table II for illustrative purposes.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE II______________________________________     +76  +99    +101   +103 +104 +107 +123______________________________________B. amyloliquefaciens       N      D      S    Q    Y    I    N(wild-type)B. lentus (wild-type)       N      S      S    S    V    I    N______________________________________</pre></p><p>Equivalent residues may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for a precursor carbonyl hydrolase whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the precursor carbonyl hydrolase and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the carbonyl hydrolase in question to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. The best model is the crystallographic model giving the lowest R factor for experimental diffraction data at the highest resolution available. ##EQU1##</p><p>Equivalent residues which are functionally analogous to a specific residue of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin are defined as those amino acids of the precursor carbonyl hydrolases which may adopt a conformation such that they either alter, modify or contribute to protein structure, substrate binding or catalysis in a manner defined and attributed to a specific residue of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. Further, they are those residues of the precursor carbonyl hydrolase (for which a tertiary structure has been obtained by x-ray crystallography) which occupy an analogous position to the extent that, although the main chain atoms of the given residue may not satisfy the criteria of equivalence on the basis of occupying a homologous position, the atomic coordinates of at least two of the side chain atoms of the residue lie with 0.13 nm of the corresponding side chain atoms of Bacillus amylotiquefaciens subtilisin. The coordinates of the three dimensional structure of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin are set forth in EPO Publication No. 0 251 446 (equivalent to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/212,291, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) and can be used as outlined above to determine equivalent residues on the level of tertiary structure.</p><p>Some of the residues identified for substitution, insertion or deletion are conserved residues whereas others are not. In the case of residues which are not conserved, the replacement of one or more amino acids is limited to substitutions which produce a variant which has an amino acid sequence that does not correspond to one found in nature. In the case of conserved residues, such replacements should not result in a naturally-occurring sequence. The carbonyl hydrolase variants useful in the present invention include the mature forms of carbonyl hydrolase variants, as well as the pro- and prepro-forms of such hydrolase variants. The prepro-forms are the preferred construction since this facilitates the expression, secretion and maturation of the carbonyl hydrolase variants.</p><p>"Prosequence" refers to a sequence of amino acids bound to the N-terminal portion of the mature form of a carbonyl hydrolase which when removed results in the appearance of the "mature" form of the carbonyl hydrolase. Many proteolytic enzymes are found in nature as translational proenzyme products and, in the absence of post-translational processing, are expressed in this fashion. A preferred prosequence for producing carbonyl hydrolase variants, specifically subtilisin variants, is the putative prosequence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin, although other subtilisin prosequences may be used. In the Examples, the putative prosequence from the subtilisin from Bacillus lentus (ATCC 21536) is used.</p><p>A "signal sequence" or "presequence" refers to any sequence of amino acids bound to the N-terminal portion of a carbonyl hydrolase or to the N-terminal portion of a prohydrolase which may participate in the secretion of the mature or pro forms of the hydrolase. This definition of signal sequence is a functional one, meant to include all those amino acid sequences encoded by the N-terminal portion of the subtilisin gene or other secretable carbonyl hydrolases which participate in the effectuation of the secretion of subtilisin or other carbonyl hydrolases under native conditions. The protease enzymes useful for the present invention utilize such sequences to effect the secretion of the carbonyl hydrolase variants as described herein. A preferred signal sequence used in the Examples comprises the first seven amino acid residues of the signal sequence from Bacillus subtilis subtilisin fused to the remainder of the signal sequence of the subtilisin from Bacillus lentus (ATCC 21536).</p><p>A "prepro" form of a carbonyl hydrolase variant consists of the mature form of the hydrolase having a prosequence operably linked to the amino terminus of the hydrolase and a "pre" or "signal" sequence operably linked to the amino terminus of the prosequence.</p><p>"Expression vector" refers to a DNA construct containing a DNA sequence which is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting the expression of said DNA in a suitable host. Such control sequences include a promoter to effect transcription, an optional operator sequence to control such transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosome binding sites and sequences which control termination of transcription and translation. The vector may be a plasmid, a phage particle, or simply a potential genomic insert. Once transformed into a suitable host, the vector may replicate and function independently of the host genome, or may, in some instances, integrate into the genome itself. In the present specification, "plasmid" and "vector" are sometimes used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector at present. However, included herein are such other forms of expression vectors which serve equivalent functions and which are, or become, known in the art.</p><p>The "host cells" used in the present invention generally are procaryotic or eucaryotic hosts which preferably have been manipulated by the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,025 (RE 34,606) to render them incapable of secreting enzymatically active endoprotease. A preferred host cell for expressing subtilisin is the Bacillus strain BG2036 which is deficient in enzymatically active neutral protease and alkaline protease (subtilisin). The construction of strain BG2036 is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,366. Other host cells for expressing subtilisin include Bacillus subtilis 1168 (also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,025 (RE 34,606) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,366, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference), as well as any suitable Bacillus strain such as B. licheniformis, B. lentus, etc.</p><p>Host cells are transformed or transfected with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Such transformed host cells are capable of either replicating vectors encoding the carbonyl hydrolase variants or expressing the desired carbonyl hydrolase variant. In the case of vectors which encode the pre- or prepro-form of the carbonyl hydrolase variant, such variants, when expressed, are typically secreted from the host cell into the host cell medium.</p><p>"Operably linked," when describing the relationship between two DNA regions, simply means that they are functionally related to each other. For example, a presequence is operably linked to a peptide if it functions as a signal sequence, participating in the secretion of the mature form of the protein most probably involving cleavage of the signal sequence. A promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence; a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to permit translation.</p><p>The genes encoding the naturally-occurring precursor carbonyl hydrolase may be obtained in accord with the general methods known to those skilled in the art. The methods generally comprise synthesizing labeled probes having putative sequences encoding regions of the hydrolase of interest, preparing genomic libraries from organisms expressing the hydrolase, and screening the libraries for the gene of interest by hybridization to the probes. Positively hybridizing clones are then mapped and sequenced. The B. lentus gene used in the Examples is cloned as described in Example 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,258, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein. The BPN' gene used in the Examples is cloned as described in Example 1 in RE 34,606, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein.</p><p>The cloned carbonyl hydrolase is then used to transform a host cell in order to express the hydrolase. The hydrolase gene is then ligated into a high copy number plasmid. This plasmid replicates in hosts in the sense that it contains the well-known elements necessary for plasmid replication: a promoter operably linked to the gene in question (which may be supplied as the gene's own homologous promotor if it is recognized, i.e., transcribed, by the host), a transcription termination and polyadenylation region (necessary for stability of the MRNA transcribed by the host from the hydrolase gene in certain eucaryotic host cells) which is exogenous or is supplied by the endogenous terminator region of the hydrolase gene and, desirably, a selection gene such as an antibiotic resistance gene that enables continuous cultural maintenance of plasmid-infected host cells by growth in antibiotic-containing media. High copy number plasmids also contain an origin of replication for the host, thereby enabling large numbers of plasmids to be generated in the cytoplasm without chromosomal limitations. However, it is within the scope herein to integrate multiple copies of the hydrolase gene into host genome. This is facilitated by procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms which are particularly susceptible to homologous recombination.</p><p>The genes used in the present examples are a natural B. lentus gene and a natural B. amyloliquefaciens gene. Alternatively, a synthetic gene encoding a naturally-occurring or mutant precursor carbonyl hydrolase (subtilisin) may be produced. In such an approach, the DNA and/or amino acid sequence of the precursor hydrolase (subtilisin) is determined. Multiple, overlapping synthetic single-stranded DNA fragments are thereafter synthesized, which upon hybridization and ligation produce a synthetic DNA encoding the precursor hydrolase. An example of synthetic gene construction is set forth in Example 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,015, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>Once the naturally-occurring or synthetic precursor carbonyl hydrolase gene has been cloned, a number of modifications are undertaken to enhance the use of the gene beyond synthesis of the naturally-occurring precursor carbonyl hydrolase. Such modifications include the production of recombinant carbonyl hydrolases as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,025 (RE 34,606) and EPO Publication No. 0 251 446 and the production of carbonyl hydrolase variants described herein.</p><p>The following cassette mutagenesis method may be used to facilitate the construction and identification of the carbonyl hydrolase variants useful in the present invention, although other methods including site-directed mutagenesis may be used. First, the naturally-occurring gene encoding the hydrolase is obtained and sequenced in whole or in part. Then the sequence is scanned for a point at which it is desired to make a mutation (deletion, insertion or substitution) of one or more amino acids in the encoded enzyme. The sequences flanking this point are evaluated for the presence of restriction sites for replacing a short segment of the gene with an oligonucleotide pool which when expressed will encode various mutants. Such restriction sites are preferably unique sites within the hydrolase gene so as to facilitate the replacement of the gene segment However, any convenient restriction site which is not overly redundant in the hydrolase gene may be used, provided the gene fragments generated by restriction digestion can be reassembled in proper sequence. If restriction sites are not present at locations within a convenient distance from the selected point (from 10 to 15 nucleotides), such sites are generated by substituting nucleotides in the gene in such a fashion that neither the reading frame nor the amino acids encoded are changed in the final construction. Mutation of the gene in order to change its sequence to conform to the desired sequence is accomplished by M13 primer extension in accord with generally known methods. The task of locating suitable flanking regions and evaluating the needed changes to arrive at two convenient restriction site sequences is made routine by the redundancy of the genetic code, a restriction enzyme map of the gene and the large number of different restriction enzymes. Note that if a convenient flanking restriction site is available, the above method need be used only in connection with the flanking region which does not contain a site.</p><p>Once the naturally-ccurring DNA or synthetic DNA is cloned, the restriction sites flanking the positions to be mutated are digested with the cognate restriction enzymes and a plurality of end termini-complementary oligonucleotide cassettes are ligated into the gene. The mutagenesis is simplified by this method because all of the oligonucleotides can be synthesized so as to have the same restriction sites, and no synthetic linkers are necessary to create the restriction sites.</p><p>As used herein, proteolytic activity is defined as the rate of hydrolysis of peptide bonds per milligram of active enzyme. Many well known procedures exist for measuring proteolytic activity (K. M. Kalisz, "Microbial Proteinases," Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, A. Fiechter ed., 1988). In addition to or as an alternative to modified proteolytic activity, the variant enzymes of the present invention may have other modified properties such as K.sub.m, K.sub.cat, K.sub.cat /K.sub.m ratio andlor modified substrate specificity and/or modified pH activity profile. These enzymes can be tailored for the particular substrate which is anticipated to be present, for example, for hydrolytic processes such as laundry uses.</p><p>One objective can be to secure a variant carbonyl hydrolase having altered proteolytic activity as compared to the precursor carbonyl hydrolase, since increasing such activity (numerically larger) enables the use of the enzyme to more efficiently act on a target substrate. Also of interest are variant enzymes having altered thermal stability and/or altered substrate specificity as compared to the precursor. Preferably the carbonyl hydrolase to be mutated is a subtilisin. Specific amino acids useful to obtain such results in subtilisin-type carbonyl hydrolases at residues equivalent to +76, +99, +101, +103, +104, +107, +123, +27, +105, +109, +126, +128, +135 +156, +166, +195, +197, +204, +206, +210, +216, +217, +218, +222, +260, +265 and/or +274 or any combination thereof in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin are presented in the Examples. In some instances, lower proteolytic activity may be desirable. Conversely, in some instances it may be desirable to increase the proteolytic activity of the variant enzyme versus its precursor. Additionally, increases or decreases (alteration) of the stability of the variant, whether alkaline or thermal stability, may be desirable. Increases or decreases in K.sub.cat, K.sub.m or K.sub.cat /K.sub.m are specific to the substrate used to determine these kinetic parameters.</p><p>Also, it has been determined that residues equivalent to +76 in combination with a number of other modifications in subtilisin are important in modulating overall stability and/or proteolytic activity of the enzyme. Thus, as set forth in the Examples, the Asparagine (N) in Bacillus lentus subtilisin at equivalent position +76 can be substituted with Aspartate (D) in the preferred protease enzymes in combination with modification of one or more of the following amino acid residues +99, +101, +103, +104, +107, +123 +27, +105, +109, +126, +128, 135, +156, +166, +195, +197, +204, +206, +210, +216, +217, +218, +222, +260, +265 and/or +274 to produce enhanced stability and/or enhanced activity of the resulting mutant enzyme.</p><p>The most preferred protease enzymes useful in this invention are set forth in the Examples. These include the following specific combinations of substituted residues: N76D/S99D; N76D/V104I; N76D/S99D/V104I; N76D/S103A/V104I; N76D/V104I/I107V; N76D/V104Y/I107V and N76D/S101R/S103A/V104I. These substitutions are preferably made in Bacillus lentus (recombinant or native-type) subtilisin, although the substitutions may be made in any Bacillus subtilisin.</p><p>Based on the results obtained with this and other variant subtilisins, it is apparent that residues in carbonyl hydrolases (preferably subtilisin) equivalent to positions +76, +99, +101, +103, +104, +107, +123, +27, +105, +109, +126, +128, +135, +156, +166, +195, +197, +204, +206, +210, +216, +217, +218, +222, +260, +265 and/or +274 in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are important to the proteolytic activity, performance and/or stability of these enzymes and the cleaning or wash performance of such variant enzymes.</p><p>The following is presented by way of example for manufacturing protease enzymes useful in the present invention compositions.</p><heading>Protease Manufacture Example</heading><p>Construction for the Expression of GG36 Gene in B. subtilis The cloning and the construction for expression of the subtilisin gene from B. lentus is performed essentially the same as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,258. The plasmid GGA274 (described in FIG. 4 herein) is further modified in the following manner, as shown in FIG. 5. The PstI site that is introduced during the construction of the GGA274 plasmid is removed by the oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis described below, with an oligonucleotide having the following sequence: 5'GAAGCTGCAACTCGTTAAA3' (Seq. ID No.1). The underlined "A" residue eliminates the recognition sequence of restriction enzyme PstI and changes the corresponding amino acid residue from alanine to threonine at position 274. Threonine at position 274 is the wild-type residue originally found in the cloned B. lentus subtilisin gene sequences. The DNA segment encoding subtilisin is excised from the plasmid GGA274 or its derivatives (GGT274 shown in FIG. 5) by EcoRI and BamHI digest. The DNA fragment is subcloned back into Bacteriophage M13-based vectors, such as MP19, for mutagenesis. After mutagenesis, the EcoRI and HindIII digest, followed by cloning, are performed to move the mutated subtilisin gene back into an expression plasmid like GGA274 for the expression and the recovery of mutated subtilisin proteins.</p><heading>Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis</heading><p>Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis is performed as described in Zoller, M. et al. (1983), Methods Enzymol., 100:468-500. As an example, a synthetic oligonucleotide of the sequence 5'GCTGCTCTAGACAATTCG 3'(Seq. ID No.2) is used to change the amino acid residue at position 76 from asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D), or N76D. The underlined "G" and "C" residues denote changes from the wild-type gene sequence. The CA keeps the leucine at position +75 and changes the amino acid sequence to introduce an XbaI recognition site of the XbaI restriction enzyme (TCTAGA), while the change at GAC changes asparagine at +76 to aspartate.</p><p>For mutagenesis at positions 99, 101, 103 and 104, different oligonucleotides can be used depending on the combination of mutations desired. For example, an oligonucleotide of the sequence 5'GTATTAGGGGCGGACGGTCGAGGCGCCATCAGCTCGATT 3' (Seq. ID No.3) is used to simultaneously make the following changes: S99D; S101R; S103A and V104I in a single subtilisin molecule. Similarly, oligonucleotides of the sequence 5'TCAGGTTCGGTCTCGAGCGTTGCCCAAGGATTG 3'(Seq. ID No.4) and 5'CACGTTGCTAGCTTGAGTTTAG 3' (Seq. ID No.5) are utilized to generate I107V and N123S, respectively. Again, the underlined residues denote changes from wild-type sequences which produce desired changes either in amino acid sequences or restriction enzyme recognition sequences.</p><heading>Proteolytic Activity of Subtilisin Variants</heading><p>Following the methods of Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis hereinbefore, the variants listed in Table III are made. Proteolytic activity of each of these subtilisin variants is shown in Table III. The kinetic parameters k.sub.cat, K.sub.M, and k.sub.cat /K.sub.M are measured for hydrolysis of the synthetic peptide substrate succinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide using the method described in P. Bonneau et al. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 113, No. 3, p. 1030. Briefly, a small aliquot of subtilisin variant stock solution is added to a 1 cm cuvette containing substrate dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCL buffer, pH 8.6, and thermostated at 25 spectrophotometrically by monitoring the absorbance of the reaction product p-nitroaniline at 410 nm. Kinetic parameters are obtained by using a non-linear regression algorithm to fit the reaction velocity and product concentration for each reaction to the Michaelis-Menten equation.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE III__________________________________________________________________________Kinetic Parameters k.sub.cat, K.sub.M and k.sub.cat /K.sub.MMeasured for Bacillus lentus Subtilisin and VariantsEnzyme                     k.sub.cat /K.sub.MProtease #Variants          k.sub.cat (s.sup.-1)                       K.sub.M (M)                           (s.sup.-1 M.sup.-1)__________________________________________________________________________--   B. lentus Subtilisin                  170  0.00078                           2.18 --   N76D              219  0.0008                           2.74  1   N76D/S99D          88  0.00061                           1.44  2   N76D/S101R        371  0.0013                           2.85  3   N76D/S103A        400  0.0014                           2.86  4   N76D/V104I        459  0.0011                           4.17  5   N76D/I107V        219  0.0011                           1.99  6   N76D/N123S        115  0.0018                           6.40  7   N76D/S99D/S101R   146  0.00038                           3.84  8   N76D/S99D/S103A   157  0.0012                           1.31  9   N76D/S99D/V104I   247  0.00097                           2.55 10   N76D/S101R/S103A  405  0.00069                           5.90 11   N76D/S101R/V104I  540  0.00049                           1.10 12   N76D/S103A/V104I  832  0.0016                           5.20 13   N76D/V104I/I107V  497  0.00045                           1.10 14   N76D/V104Y/I107V  330  0.00017                           1.90 15   N76D/V104I/N123S  251  0.0026                           9.65 16   N76D/I107V/N123S  147  0.0035                           4.20 17   N76D/S99D/S101R/S103A                  242  0.00074                           3.27 18   N76D/S99D/S101R/V104I                  403  0.00072                           5.60 19   N76D/S99D/S103A/V104I                  420  0.0016                           2.62 20   N76D/S101R/S103A/V104I                  731  0.00065                           1.12 21   N76D/S103A/V104I/N123S                  321  0.0026                           1.23 22   N76D/V104I/I107V/N123S                  231  0.003                           7.70 23   N76D/S99D/S101R/S103A/V104I                  624  0.00098                           6.37 24   N76D/S99D/S103A/V104I/N123S                  194  0.0043                           4.51 25   N76D/S99D/S101R/S103A/V104I/N123S                  311  0.0023                           1.35 __________________________________________________________________________ The results listed in Table III indicate that all of the subtilisin variants tested retain proteolytic activity.

Purified enzyme, 15 ug/ml in 0.1 M glycine 0.01% Tween80 pH 10.0, with or without 50 mM CaCl.sub.2, is aliquotted into small tubes and incubated at 10 and 60 minutes. Aliquots from the tubes are assayed for enzyme activity by addition to 1 cm cuvettes containing 1.2 mM of the synthetic peptide substrate succinyl-L-ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide dissolved in 0.1 M tris-HCL buffer, pH 8.6, thermostatted at 25 linear reaction velocity is followed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the absorbance of the reaction product p-nitroaniline at 410 nm as a function of time. Data are presented as percent activity prior to heating.

Construction of B. lentus Variants</p><p>The mutagenesis protocol is essentially the same as described above in Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis. The single-stranded DNA template is generated by phagemid method. To construct the phagemid vector for generating the single-stranded DNA template we first construct the vector pBCDAICAT. The flow chart of vector construction is outlined in FIG. 8. First, the C1al to C1al fragment encoding the CAT gene from pC194 plasmid (Horinouchi, S. and Weisblum, B., J. Bacteriol., 150:8-15, 1982) is cloned into the Accl site of polylinker region of pUC19 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.) to make plasmid pUCCHL and the EcoRI-DraI 0.6 KB fragment from the 5' end of the GG36DAl encoding DNA is cloned into the EcoRI and EcoRV sites of pBSKS plasmid (Stratagene, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) to make pBC2SK5. The single EcoRI site of the plasmid pBC2SK5 is eliminated by EcoRI digestion, followed by filling in catalyzed-by-T4 DNA polymerase, and religation to generate the plasmid pBC2SK-5R which does not have the EcoRI site. The EcoRI-DraI fragment which is cloned into pBCSK-5R is isolated as a PstI-HindIII fragment and cloned into the PstI-HindIII site of the pUCCHL (part of the polylinker of pUC19) to generate plasmid pUCCHL5R. The encoding sequence of GG36DAI gene is excised as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pUCCHL5R to make pUCCAT. The large EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pUCCAT is then cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of BS2KS+ to generate the plasmid pBCDAICAT.</p><p>To generate single-stranded DNA, E. coli-containing pBCDAICAT are infected with phage R408 (obtained from Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.) following the protocol described in Russel, M., Kidd, S. and Kelley, M. R., GENE 45:333-338, 1986. Once the single-stranded DNA template is available, standard mutagenesis methods as described above in Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutogenesis are carried out The construction of certain mutants is detailed below for illustrative purposes.</p><p>For the construction of B. lentus (GG36) N76D/S103A/V104I/L217H, an EcoRI-BamHI DNA fragment encoding GG36 N76D/S103A/V104I is used in the construction of pUCCAT (see FIG. 8) to generate the plasmid pBCDAICAT. After the single-stranded DNA template is made following the protocol described above, a mutagenesis primer with the following sequence</p><p>* *** ** x C1al</p><p>5'TAT GCC AGC CAC AAC GGT ACT TCG ATG GCT 3' (Seq. ID No.13)</p><p>is used to make the L217H. As before, the underlined residues denote the nucleotide changes that are made and the x C1al indicates that the existing C1al site is eliminated after the mutagenesis. The mutagenesis protocol is as described in Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutogenesis hereinbefore. After the mutagenesis, plasmid DNA is first screened for the elimination of the C1al site and those clones missing the C1al site are subjected to DNA sequence analysis to verify the DNA sequence which made the L to H change at the 217th amino acid residue.</p><p>B. Construction of BPN' Variants and their Expression in B. subtilis</p><p>The construction of B. amyloliquefaciens (BPN') N76D/Q103A/Y104I/Y217L is done in a similar fashion except in two consecutive steps. N76D is first introduced into BPN' Y217L to make BPN' N76D/Y217L and a second mutagenesis is done to convert BPN' N76D/Y217L to BPN' N76D/Q103A/Y104I/Y217L. To generate the single-stranded DNA template for the first mutagenesis, an EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding BPN' Y217L subtilisin (derived from the Y217L plasmid described in Wells, J., et al., PNAS, 84, 5167, 1087) is used to construct a plasmid pUCCATFNA (see FIG. 9). The pUCCATFNA plasmid containing BPN' Y217L is used to construct the pBCFNACAT plasmid (FIG. 9). Single-stranded DNA is generated as described above. To generate BPN' N76D/Y217L, an oligonucleotide primer with the sequence</p><p>* *** ** XbaI</p><p>5'C ACA GTT GCG GCT CTA GAT AAC TCA ATC GGT G 3' (Seq.

All steps involved in the cloning, the single-stranded DNA preparation, the mutagenesis, and the screening for mutants are carried out as described above. Expression of the BPN' gene and its variants are achieved by integrating plasmid DNA (pBCFNACAT containing the different variants' BPN' gene) directly into a protease-deficient strain of Bacillus subtilis as described in RE 34,606.</p><p>Numerous variants are made as per the teachings of these Protease Manufacture Examples.

agent and protease enzyme described hereinbefore, one or more cleaning composition materials compatible with the protease enzyme. The term "cleaning composition materials", as used herein, means any liquid, solid or gaseous material selected for the particular type of cleaning composition desired and the form of the product (e.g., liquid; granule; spray composition), which materials are also compatible with the protease enzyme used in the composition. The specific selection of cleaning composition materials are readily made by considering the surface, item or fabric to be cleaned, and the desired form of the composition for the cleaning conditions during use (e.g., through the wash detergent use). The term "compatible", as used herein, means the cleaning composition materials do not reduce the proteolytic activity of the protease enzyme to such an extent that the protease is not effective as desired during normal use situations. Specific cleaning composition materials are exemplified in detail hereinafter.</p><p>An effective amount of one or more protease enzymes described above are included in compositions useful for cleaning a variety of surfaces in need of proteinaceous stain removal. Such cleaning compositions include detergent compositions for cleaning hard surfaces, unlimited in form (e.g., liquid and granular); detergent compositions for cleaning fabrics, unlimited in form (e.g., granular, liquid and bar formulations); dishwashing compositions (unlimited in form); oral cleaning compositions, unlimited in form (e.g., dentifrice, toothpaste and mouthwash formulations); and denture cleaning compositions, unlimited in form (e.g., liquid, tablet). As used herein, "effective amount of protease enzyme" refers to the quantity of protease enzyme described hereinbefore necessary to achieve the enzymatic activity necessary in the specific cleaning composition. Such effective amounts are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art and is based on many factors, such as the particular enzyme variant used, the cleaning application, the specific composition of the cleaning composition, and whether a liquid or dry (e.g., granular, bar) composition is required, and the like.</p><p>Preferably the cleaning compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.0001% to about 10% of one or more protease enzymes, more preferably from about 0.001% to about 1%, more preferably still from about 0.001% to about 0.1%. Also preferably the protease enzyme is present in the compositions in an amount sufficient to provide a ratio of mg of active protease per 100 grams of composition to ppm theoretical Available O.sub.2 ("AvO.sub.2 ") from the peroxyacid in the wash liquor, referred to herein as the Enzyme to Bleach ratio (E/B ratio), ranging from about 1:1 to about 20:1. Several examples of various cleaning compositions wherein the protease enzymes may be employed are discussed in further detail below. All parts, percentages and ratios used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.</p><p>(i) Optional Detersive Enzymes</p><p>The compositions and methods herein are effective with all manner of detersive enzymes in addition to the specified protease enzymes. Optional detersive enzymes useful in the present invention may be included for a wide variety of fabric laundering purposes, including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceride-based stains, for example, and for the prevention of fugitive dye transfer. The enzymes to be incorporated include other proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, and peroxidases, as well as mixtures thereof. Other types of enzymes may also be included. They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. However, their choice is governed by several factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, stability versus active detergents, builders and so on. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases.</p><p>Enzymes are normally incorporated at levels sufficient to provide up to about 50 mg by weight, more typically about 0.01 mg to about 10 mg, of active enzyme per gram of detergent composition. Stated otherwise, an effective amount of the optional enzymes employed in the present invention will typically comprise at least about 0.001%, preferably from about 0.001% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.001% to about 1%, most preferably from about 0.01% to about 1%, by weight of detergent composition.</p><p>Suitable examples of optional proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B.subtilis and B.licheniforms. Another suitable protease is a modified bacterial serine protease enzyme obtained from Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold by Novo Industries AtS under the registered trade name ESPERASE. The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes is described in British Patent Specification No. 1,243,784 of Novo. Other proteolytic enzymes that are commercially available include those sold under the tradenames ALCALASE and SAVINASE by Novo Industries A/S (Denmark) and MAXATASE by International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. (The Netherlands). Still other proteases include Protease A (see European Patent Application 130,756, published Jan. 9, 1985) and Protease B (see European Patent Application Serial No. 87303761.8, filed Apr. 28, 1987, and European Patent Application 130,756, Bott et al, published Jan. 9, 1985), and what is called herein "Protease C", which is a triple variant of an alkaline serine protease from Bacillus in which tyrosine replaced valine at position 104, serine replaced asparagine at position 123, and alanine replaced threonine at position 274. Protease C is described in EP 90915958.4, corresponding to WO 91/06637, published May 16, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference. Genetically modified variants, particularly of Protease C, are also included herein.</p><p>Amylases include, for example, a-amylases described in British Patent Specification No. 1,296,839 (Novo), RAPIDASE, International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. and TERMAMYL, Novo Industries.</p><p>The cellulases usable in the present invention include both bacterial or fungal cellulase. Preferably, they will have a pH optimum of between 5 and 9.5. Suitable cellulases are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,307, Barbesgoard et al, issued Mar. 6, 1984, which discloses fungal cellulase produced from Humicola insolens and Humicola strain DSM1800 or a cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas, and cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk (Dolabella Auricula Solander). Suitable cellulases are also disclosed in GB-A-2.075.028; GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832.</p><p>Suitable lipase enzymes for detergent usage include those produced by microorganisms of the Pseudomonas group, such as Pseudomonas stutzeri ATCC 19.154, as disclosed in British Patent 1,372,034. See also lipases in Japanese Patent Application 53-20487, laid open to public inspection on Feb. 24, 1978. This lipase is available from Amano Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan, under the trade name Lipase P "Amano," hereinafter referred to as "Amano-P." Other commercial lipases include Amano-CES, lipases ex Chromobacter viscosum, e.g. Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRLB 3673, commercially available from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan; and further Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S. Biochemical Corp., U.S.A. and Disoynth Co., The Netherlands, and lipases ex Pseudomonas gladioli. The LIPOLASE enzyme, derived from the fungus Humicola lanuginosa and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae as host and commercially available from Novo (see also E.P. Patent No. 341,947) is a preferred lipase for use herein.</p><p>Peroxidase enzymes are used in combination with oxygen sources, e.g., percarbonate, perborate, persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, etc. They are used for "solution bleaching," i.e. to prevent transfer of dyes or pigments removed from sub-strates during wash operations to other substrates in the wash solution. Peroxidase enzymes are known in the art, and include, for example, horseradish peroxidase, ligninase, and haloperoxidase such as chloro- and bromo-peroxidase. Peroxidase-containing detergent compositions are disclosed, for example, in PCT International Application WO 89/099813, published Oct. 19, 1989, by O. Kirk, assigned to Novo Industries A/S.</p><p>A wide range of enzyme materials and means for their incorporation into synthetic detergent granules is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,553,139, issued Jan. 5, 1971 to McCarty et al. Enzymes are further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,457, Place et al, issued Jul. 18, 1978, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,219, Hughes, issued Mar. 26, 1985, both. Enzyme materials useful for liquid detergent formulations, and their incorporation into such formulations, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,261,868, Hora et al, issued Apr. 14, 1981. Enzymes for use in detergents can be stabilized by various techniques. Enzyme stabilization techniques are disclosed and exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,261,868, issued Apr. 14, 1981 to Horn, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,600,319, issued Aug. 17, 1971 to Gedge, et al, and European Patent Application Publication No. 0199405, Application No. 86200586.5, published Oct. 29, 1986, Venegas. Enzyme stabilization systems are also described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,261,868, 3,600,319, and 3,519,570.</p><p>(ii) Enzyme Stabilizers</p><p>The enzymes employed herein can be stabilized by the presence of water-soluble sources of calcium ions in the finished compositions which provide calcium ions to the enzymes. Additional stability can be provided by the presence of various other art-disclosed stabilizers, especially borate species: see Severson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,537,706, cited above. Typical detergents, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 5 to about 15, and most preferably from about 8 to about 12, millimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished composition. This can vary somewhat, depending on the amount of enzyme present and its response to the calcium ions. The level of calcium ion should be selected so that there is always some minimum level available for the enzyme, after allowing for complexation with builders, fatty acids, etc., in the composition. Any water-soluble calcium salt can be used as the source of calcium ion, including, but not limited to, calcium chloride, calcium sulfate, calcium malate, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, and calcium acetate. A small amount of calcium ion, generally from about 0.05 to about 0.4 millimoles per liter, is often also present in the composition due to calcium in the enzyme slurry and formula water. In solid detergent compositions the formulation may include a sufficient quantity of a water-soluble calcium ion source to provide such amounts in the laundry liquor. In the alternative, natural water hardness may suffice.</p><p>The compositions herein may also optionally, but preferably, contain various additional stabilizers including silicate coatings and, especially borate-type stabilizers. Typically, such stabilizers will be used at levels in the compositions from about 0.25% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.75% to about 3%, by weight of boric acid or other borate compound capable of forming boric acid in the composition (calculated on the basis of boric acid). Boric acid is preferred, although other compounds such as boric oxide, borax and other alkali metal borates (e.g., sodium ortho-, meta- and pyroborate, and sodium pentaborate) are suitable. Substituted boric acids (e.g., phenylboronic acid, butane boronic acid, and p-bromo phenylboronic acid) can also be used in place of boric acid.</p><p>(iii) Detersive Surfactant</p><p>The amount of detersive surfactant included in the fully-formulated detergent compositions afforded by the present invention can vary from about 1% to about 99.8% depending upon the particular surfactants used and the effects desired. Preferably, the detersive surfactants comprise from about 5% to about 80% by weight of the detergent ingredients.</p><p>The detersive surfactant can be nonionic, anionic, ampholytic, zwitterionic, or cationic. Mixtures of these surfactants can also be used. Preferred detergent compositions comprise anionic detersive surfactants or mixtures of anionic surfactants with other surfactants, especially nonionic surfactants.</p><p>Nonlimiting examples of surfactants useful herein include the conventional C.sub.11 -C.sub.18 alkyl benzene sulfonates and primary, secondary, and random alkyl sulfates, the C.sub.10 -C.sub.18 alkyl alkoxy sulfates, the C.sub.10 -C.sub.18 alkyl polyglycosides and their corresponding sulfated polyglycosides, C.sub.12 -C.sub.18 alpha-sulfonated fatty acid esters, C.sub.12 -C.sub.18 alkyl and alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially ethoxylates and mixed ethoxy/propoxy), C.sub.12 -C.sub.18 betaines and sulfobetaines ("sultaines"), C.sub.10 -C.sub.18 amine oxides, C.sub.8 -C.sub.24 sarcosinates (especially oleoyl sarcosinate) and the like. Other conventional useful surfactants are listed in standard texts.</p><p>One particular class of adjunct nonionic surfactants especially useful herein comprises the polyhydroxy fatty acid amides of the formula: ##STR25## wherein: R.sup.1 is H, C.sub.1 -C.sub.8 hydrocarbyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, or a mixture thereof, preferably C.sub.1 -C.sub.4 alkyl, more preferably C.sub.1 or C.sub.2 alkyl, most preferably C.sub.1 alkyl (i.e., methyl); and R.sup.2 is a C.sub.5 -C.sub.32 hydrocarbyl moiety, preferably straight chain C.sub.7 -C.sub.19 alkyl or alkenyl, more preferably straight chain C.sub.9 -C.sub.17 alkyl or alkenyl, most preferably straight chain C.sub.11 -C.sub.19 alkyl or alkenyt, or mixture thereof, and Z is a polyhydroxyhydrocarbyl moiety having a linear hydrocarbyl chain with at least 2 (in the case of glyceraldehyde) or at least 3 hydroxyls (in the case of other reducing sugars) directly connected to the chain, or an alkoxylated derivative (preferably ethoxylated or propoxylated) thereof. Z preferably will be derived from a reducing sugar in a reductive amination reaction; more preferably Z is a glycityl moiety. Suitable reducing sugars include glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose, galactose, mannose, and xylose, as well as glyceraldehyde. As raw materials, high dextrose corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, and high maltose corn syrup can be utilized as well as the individual sugars listed above. These corn syrups may yield a mix of sugar components for Z. It should be understood that it is by no means intended to exclude other suitable raw materials. Z preferably will be selected from the group consisting of --CH.sub.2 --(CHOH).sub.n --CH.sub.2 OH, --CH(CH.sub.2 OH)--(CHOH).sub.n-1 -- --CH.sub.2 OH, --CH.sub.2 --(CHOH).sub.2 (CHOR')(CHOH)--CH.sub.2 OH, where n is an integer from 1 to 5, inclusive, and R' is H or a cyclic mono- or poly-saccharide, and alkoxylated derivatives thereof. Most preferred are glycityls wherein n is 4: particularly --CH.sub.2 --(CHOH).sub.4 CH.sub.2 OH.</p><p>In Formula (I), R.sup.1 can be, for example, N-methyl, N-ethyl, N-propyl, N-isopropyl, N-butyl, N-isobutyl, N-2-hydroxy ethyl, or N-2-hydroxy propyl. For highest sudsing, R.sup.1 is preferably methyl or hydroxyalkyl. If lower sudsing is desired, R.sup.1 is preferably C.sub.2 -C.sub.8 alkyl, especially n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, pentyl, hexyl and 2-ethyl hexyl.</p><p>R.sup.2 --CO--N&amp;lt; can be, for example, cocamide, stearamide, oleamide, lauramide, myristamide, capricamide, palmitamide, tallowamide, etc.</p><p>Another class of nonionic surfactants particularly useful in the present invention are condensates of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic moiety to provide a surfactant having an average hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) in the range from 5 to 17, preferably from 6 to 14, more preferably from 7 to 12. The hydrophobic (lipophilic) moiety may be aliphatic or aromatic in nature and the length of the polyoxyethylene group which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements.</p><p>Especially preferred nonionic surfactants of this type are the C.sub.9 -C.sub.15 primary alcohol ethoxylates containing 3-8 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, particularly the C.sub.14 -C.sub.15 primary alcohols containing 6-8 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, the C.sub.12 -C.sub.15 primary alcohols containing 3-5 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and mixtures thereof.</p><p>(iv) Detersive Builders</p><p>Optional detergent ingredients employed in the present invention contain inorganic and/or organic detersive builders to assist in mineral hardness control. If used, these builders comprise from about 5% to about 80% by weight of the detergent compositions.</p><p>Inorganic detersive builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tri-polyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phos-phonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesqui-carbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, nonphosphate builders are required in some locales.</p><p>Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO.sub.2 :Na.sub.2 O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,839, issued May 12, 1987 to H. P. Rieck, available from Hoechst under the trademark "SKS"; SKS-6 is an especially preferred layered silicate builder.</p><p>Carbonate builders, especially a finely ground calcium carbonate with surface area greater than 10 m.sup.2 /g, are preferred builders that can be used in granular compositions. The density of such alkali metal carbonate built detergents can be in the range of 450-850 g/l with the moisture content preferably below 4%.</p><p>Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on Nov. 15, 1973.</p><p>Aluminosilicate builders are especially useful in the present invention. Preferred aluminosilicates are zeolite builders which have the formula:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="equation"><!--Greenbook equation-->Na.sub.z [(AIO.sub.2).sub.z (SiO.sub.2).sub.y ]xH.sub.2 O</pre></p><p>wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.</p><p>Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. Methods for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,985,669, Krummel, et al, issued Oct. 12, 1976, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,605,509, Corkill, et al, issued Aug. 12, 1986. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B) (including those disclosed in EPO 384,070), and Zeolite X. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter.</p><p>Organic detersive builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds, such as ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in Berg, U.S. Pat.

Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.</p><p>Other useful detersive builders include the ether hydroxy-polycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyl-oxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymateic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.</p><p>Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are preferred polycarboxylate builders that can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders.</p><p>Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,984, Bush, issued Jan. 28, 1986.</p><p>In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.</p><p>(v) Optional Detersive Adjuncts</p><p>As a preferred embodiment, the conventional detergent ingredients employed herein can be selected from typical detergent composition components such as detersive surfactants and detersive builders. Optionally, the detergent ingredients can include one or more other detersive adjuncts or other materials for assisting or enhancing cleaning performance, treatment of the substrate to be cleaned, or to modify the aesthetics of the detergent composition.

Various chelants, including the aminophosphonates, available as DEQUEST from Monsanto, the nitrilotriacetates, the hydroxyethyl-ethylenediamine triacetates, and the like, are known for such use. Preferred biodegradable, non-phosphorus chelants include ethylene-diamine disuccinate ("EDDS"; see U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,233, Hartman and Perkins), ethylenediamine-N,N'-diglutamate (EDDG) and 2-hydroxypropylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinate (HPDDS) compounds. Such chelants can be used in their alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, typically at levels from about 0.1% to about 10% of the present compositions.</p><p>The present invention compositions are especially useful as conventional laundry detergent compositions such as those typically found in granular detergents or laundry bars. U.S. Pat. No. 3,178,370, Okenfuss, issued Apr. 13, 1965, describes laundry detergent bars and processes for making them.
