structure and a method of manufacturing the same, and more particularly, 
to a hydrogen permeable structure in which a hydrogen permeable film is 
formed on a porous base material and a method of manufacturing the same. </p><heading>Background Art</heading><p num="0002">Hydrogen gas is used as a fuel for a fuel cell and the like, and is 
manufactured by e.g. a method of transforming gaseous fuel. For instance, 
according to the method of transforming gaseous fuel, water vapor is 
reformed to produce hydrogen gas, the reformed gas including, in addition 
to hydrogen as a principal component, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and 
the like as sub components. If the reformed gas is used as it is for a fuel 
cell, the cell is deteriorated in performance. Thus, there is a need for 
removing sub components, i.e. components other than hydrogen, to refine 
the reformed gas in order to obtain hydrogen gas with high purity. One of 
refining methods is to utilize a characteristic of the hydrogen permeable 
film that selectively allows only hydrogen to pass therethrough. For use, 
the hydrogen permeable film is formed on a porous support or base 
material. </p><p num="0003">For instance, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 11-267477 has 
proposed a hydrogen permeable structure in which a hydrogen permeable 
film such as a Pd film, Nb film or the like having a thickness of 
approximately 0.1 to 20 µm is formed by an ion plating technique on the 
surface of a porous support made of stainless steel or ceramic such as 
alumina and silicon nitride. </p><p num="0004">Moreover, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 11-286785 has 
proposed a hydrogen permeable structure in which Pd metal and metal to 
be alloyed with Pd are alternately layered on the surface of a porous  
 
support by an electroless plating technique or the ion plating technique, 
which is subsequently subjected to a heating process, to form a Pd alloy 
film as a hydrogen permeable film. </p><p num="0005">Furthermore, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 4-349926 has 
proposed a hydrogen gas separation film in which silica gel having an 
average pore diameter of 10 to 30Å, alumina gel having an average pore 
diameter of 15 to 30Å or silica-alumina gel having an average pore 
diameter of 10 to 20Å is formed in pores of an inorganic porous body having 
pore diameters in the range between 10 and 10000Å, and a thin film 
containing palladium is formed on the surface thereof as a hydrogen 
permeable film. </p><p num="0006">Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 10-28850 has proposed a 
hydrogen separation structure including a base material made of porous 
ceramic or porous glass, a first layer layered on the base material, and a 
second layer layered on the first layer and made of Pd or a Pd alloy as a 
hydrogen permeable film, the first layer being formed of a material having 
a thermal expansion coefficient within the range between that of the base 
material and that of the second layer. The first layer relieves stress 
applied between the base material and the second layer when the hydrogen 
separation structure is exposed to an atmosphere with large temperature 
variation, to prevent the second layer from peeling off from the base 
material. </p><p num="0007">Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 11-267477, Japanese Patent 
Laying-Open No. 11-286785, or Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 4-349926 
discloses a structure in which a hydrogen permeable film is formed 
on the surface of a porous support, which has suffered from peeling of the 
hydrogen permeable film when the hydrogen permeable structure is used in 
the atmosphere of various conditions, presenting a problem in durability. </p><p num="0008">To prevent the hydrogen permeable film from peeling off, the 
hydrogen separation structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open 
No. 10-28850 has employed a layer, formed of a material having a thermal 
expansion coefficient within the range between that of a porous base 
material and that of a hydrogen permeable film, interposed between the  
 
porous base material and the hydrogen permeable film. </p><p num="0009">By merely relieving the difference in the thermal expansion 
coefficients between the porous base material and the hydrogen permeable 
film, however, it was difficult to effectively prevent peeling of the hydrogen 
permeable film. </p><p num="0010">An object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a hydrogen 
permeable structure that can more effectively prevent peeling of a hydrogen 
permeable film and thereby having increased durability, and a method of 
manufacturing the same. </p><heading>Disclosure of the Invention</heading><p num="0011">The present inventors have examined various possible causes of 
peeling of a hydrogen permeable film, and found that the primary cause of 
the peeling is the compressive stress occurring at lattice expansion of 
metallic crystal associated with hydrogen dissolution, rather than the 
difference in thermal expansion coefficients between a porous base material 
and the hydrogen permeable film, and that such peeling can be prevented 
by forming a hydrogen permeable film with a small amount of hydrogen 
dissolution. </p><p num="0012">Based on such findings, a hydrogen permeable structure according to 
one aspect of the present invention includes a base material including 
porous ceramic and a hydrogen permeable film formed on the base material, 
including palladium (Pd) and at least one element other than palladium, 
and having an amount of hydrogen dissolution at a prescribed temperature 
smaller than that of palladium alone. </p><p num="0013">Here, the amount of hydrogen dissolution (% by weight) is defined as 
a value measured according to the method described in the 
EXPERIMENTAL section of "Solubility of Hydrogen in Palladium-Silver 
Alloys" in Russian Journal of Physical Chemistry 47(1) published in 1973, 
and is based on a value measured using a bulk sample with the same 
composition as the hydrogen permeable film. </p><p num="0014">Since the hydrogen permeable structure of the present invention has 
a hydrogen permeable film with an amount of hydrogen dissolution at a  
 
prescribed temperature smaller than that of palladium alone, the amount 
of hydrogen dissolution into the film can be reduced compared with the 
structure in which the conventional hydrogen permeable metal film of 
palladium alone, in the working temperature range including a prescribed 
temperature. Thus, expansion of the crystal lattice of palladium metal, i.e. 
expansion of the film, can be suppressed. Therefore, the compression 
stress of the film occurring by its expansion can be reduced, which can 
lower the stress applied on the interface between the film and the base 
material. This can significantly reduce physical deterioration of the 
hydrogen permeable film such as peeling, crack and the like, and can 
improve durability of the hydrogen permeable structure. </p><p num="0015">Preferably, in the hydrogen permeable structure, the prescribed 
temperature is at least 200°C and at most 700°C. </p><p num="0016">More preferably, in the hydrogen permeable structure of the present 
invention, the at least one element other than palladium that is included in 
the hydrogen permeable film is platinum (Pt). </p><p num="0017">More preferably, in the hydrogen permeable structure of the present 
invention, the hydrogen permeable film includes palladium and platinum, 
the content of the platinum being at least 5% by mass and at most 15% by 
mass. Increase of the content of platinum can further reduce the amount 
of hydrogen dissolution into the film, though it lowers the permeability 
(permeation speed) of hydrogen gas. In order to improve the hydrogen gas 
permeability to a degree higher than that of the hydrogen permeable 
structure made of palladium alone and to enhance durability of the 
hydrogen permeable structure by reducing the amount of hydrogen 
dissolution into the film, therefore, the content of platinum in the hydrogen 
permeable film including palladium and platinum is preferably set within 
the range between 5 to 15% by mass. </p><p num="0018">In the hydrogen permeable structure of the present invention, the 
porous ceramic forming the base material is preferably silicon nitride 
(Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). Among various types of ceramic, silicon nitride is superior in 
strength, fracture toughness, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance and 
heat resistance, thereby allowing further enhancement in durability of the  
 
hydrogen permeable structure of the present invention. </p><p num="0019">The porous base material has a hole on the surface, and a porous 
oxide layer formed to fill the hole is preferably provided. Thus, the surface 
of the base material is planarized while the hole at the surface is filled with 
the porous oxide layer, allowing the hydrogen permeable film to be formed 
on the surface of the base material in a closely packed manner without pin 
holes, improving permeability of the hydrogen permeable film. Moreover, 
adhesion between the surface of the base material and the hydrogen 
permeable film can be enhanced, allowing further improvement in 
durability of the hydrogen permeable structure. Here, the oxide layer 
preferably includes at least one type selected from the group consisting of 
aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), 
and more preferably, is formed of aluminum oxide. </p><p num="0020">In a method of manufacturing a hydrogen permeable structure 
according to another aspect of the present invention, a base material 
including porous ceramic is prepared, and a hydrogen permeable film is 
formed on the surface of the base material, including palladium and at 
least one element other than palladium and having an amount of hydrogen 
dissolution at a prescribed temperature smaller than that of palladium 
alone, by a PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) method. </p><p num="0021">In the manufacturing method of the present invention, the surface of 
the base material is preferably planarized by filling the hole at the surface 
with a porous oxide layer, and thereafter the hydrogen permeable film is 
formed on the surface of the base material. </p><p num="0022">Furthermore, in the manufacturing method of the present invention, 
the hydrogen permeable film is preferably formed in the atmosphere with a 
vacuum of at most 13.3 Pa (0.1 Torr). Here, the potential difference of at 
least 400V is preferably applied between the base material and a raw 
material for vapor deposition to form the hydrogen permeable film. </p><p num="0023">As described above, according to the present invention, peeling of a 
hydrogen permeable film and physical deterioration such as cracks can 
significantly be reduced, improving durability of the hydrogen permeable 
structure.  </p><heading>Brief Description of the Drawings</heading><p num="0024"><sl><li>Fig. 1 shows a schematic cross section of a hydrogen gas separation 
structure as an embodiment of the present invention. </li></sl></p><heading>Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention</heading><p num="0025">As shown in Fig. 1, according to an embodiment of a hydrogen 
permeable structure of the present invention, a hydrogen permeable 
structure is provided by forming on a porous ceramic base material 1 an 
alloy film containing palladium and an element other than palladium, as a 
hydrogen permeable film 2. The alloy film has an amount of hydrogen 
dissolution at e.g. 400°C smaller than that of a metal film formed of 
palladium alone. </p><p num="0026">Hydrogen dissolution into palladium metal causes crystal lattice of 
the palladium metal to expand. The volume of the palladium metal is 
increased by 2.8 × 10<sup>-30</sup>m<sup>3</sup> when one hydrogen atom exists in the crystal 
lattice of the palladium metal. This value and the amount of hydrogen 
dissolution into the palladium metal film are used to obtain an amount of 
expansion of the palladium metal film, which is much larger than thermal 
expansion of the palladium metal film itself when the hydrogen gas 
separation structure is used at e.g. 400°C. Therefore, in consideration of 
the combination of the porous ceramic base material and the metal film, 
reduction in hydrogen dissolution into the film, i.e., inhibition of expansion 
due to hydrogen dissolution into the film, rather than reduction in thermal 
expansion of the film itself, can lower the stress applied on the interface 
between the base material and the film, vastly improving physical 
deterioration such as film peeling and cracks. </p><p num="0027">The hydrogen permeable film may include as a component any 
elements other than palladium that has an amount of hydrogen dissolution 
at a prescribed working temperature smaller than that of a film formed of 
palladium metal alone. An embodiment is to form the hydrogen 
permeable film by adding platinum to palladium. For example, at the 
temperature of 400°C, the amount of hydrogen dissolution per 100g of  
 
palladium metal is approximately 15mg for the palladium metal alone, 
whereas, for a palladium-platinum-based alloy comprised of 90% by mass of 
palladium and 10% by mass of platinum, the amount of hydrogen 
dissolution per 100g of the alloy is approximately 8mg, which is lower. 
Moreover, as for hydrogen gas permeability, the amount of hydrogen gas 
permeation is 2.3cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>/min·cm for the palladium metal alone, whereas it 
is 2.8cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>/min·cm for the palladium-platinum-based alloy comprised of 
90% by mass of palladium and 10% by mass of platinum, showing 
improvement in the hydrogen gas permeability. It is noted that the 
measurement is performed under the condition that the temperature is 
500°C, the hydrogen pressure on the supplying side is 303.975kPa (3 
atmospheric pressure) and the hydrogen pressure on the permeation side is 
0kPa (0 atmospheric pressure). </p><p num="0028">The hydrogen permeable film may be formed of a single-layer film of 
an alloy including palladium and an element other than palladium, or may 
have a multi-layered film structure constituted by a plurality of layers of 
the alloy above. </p><p num="0029">Considering that the hydrogen permeability of the hydrogen 
permeable film is inversely proportional to the thickness thereof, the 
thickness of the hydrogen film is preferably at most 10µm, and more 
preferably at most 1µm. </p><p num="0030">Moreover, it is preferable to form the hydrogen permeable film on the 
surface of a porous ceramic base material that is planarized in such a 
manner that holes at the surface are filled with aluminum oxide, silicon 
dioxide, zirconium oxide or the like, to reduce pin holes at the film. More 
preferably, a porous aluminum oxide layer is formed at a hole portion on 
the surface of the planarized base material. The surface of the hole 
portion that has the area ratio of 30-70% is covered by the porous 
aluminum oxide layer, while ceramic particles are exposed at the surface of 
the other portion. The hydrogen permeable film formed on the surface of 
such a base material and the base material are highly adhered to each 
other. This prevents the hydrogen permeable film from peeling off from 
the base material when the hydrogen-containing gas is purified, which  
 
allows a close structure without pin holes, extremely reducing the amount 
of gas other than hydrogen passing through the hydrogen permeable film. 
Therefore, hydrogen gas with high purity can be obtained. </p><p num="0031">Though the hydrogen permeable film may be formed by any film-forming 
method, a method of physically depositing a film with a vacuum of 
at most 13.3Pa (0.1 Torr), such as an ion plating technique and a spattering 
technique, is preferably used to form the film. Here, a potential difference 
of at least 400V is preferably applied between the base material (or a base 
material holder) and a raw material for vapor deposition (a target). The 
application of such a potential difference increases energy used when the 
raw material for vapor deposition adheres to the base material, improving 
adhesion of the film to the base material. </p><p num="0032">Though there are various types of ion plating techniques and any 
type thereof may be applied to the present invention, in particular, an arc 
ion plating technique (arc discharge ion plating technique) is preferably 
used. </p><p num="0033">A film including palladium, for example, has an excellent hydrogen 
permeability as a hydrogen permeable film. The hydrogen permeability on 
the (100) plane of the palladium crystal is, however, lower than that of the 
other crystal planes. Accordingly, a film including palladium is formed 
such that the palladium crystals are oriented in their (111) planes in order 
to obtain hydrogen permeability better than that of the film without such 
orientation. According to the manufacturing method of the present 
invention, the film including palladium that is formed by applying a 
potential difference between the base material and the raw material for 
vapor deposition, palladium crystals are oriented in their (111) planes, so 
that good hydrogen permeability can be obtained. </p><p num="0034">For the porous ceramic used as a base material of the hydrogen 
permeable structure in the present invention, different types of oxides such 
as aluminum oxide or various types of nitrides such as silicon nitride may 
be applied, silicon nitride being the most preferable in terms of strength 
and the like. The silicon nitride preferably includes therein a net-like 
cavity portion where columnar β-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> crystal particles are intertangled.  
 
Moreover, the porosity of the porous silicon nitride base material is 
preferably in the range between 30 and 70%, more preferably in the range 
between 40 and 50%. Furthermore, the flexural strength of the porous 
silicon nitride base material is preferably in the range between 30 to 
450Mpa, and more preferably in the range between 200 and 450Mpa. </p><heading>[Example 1]</heading><p num="0035">A porous silicon nitride sintered body with the average pore diameter 
of 0.3µm was prepared as a base material of a hydrogen permeable 
structure. Particles of aluminum oxide with the average particle diameter 
of 0.03µm dispersed in water were applied on the surface of the base 
material and fired at a temperature of 750°C for one hour. Thus, a hole at 
the surface of the base material was filled with a porous aluminum oxide 
layer to planarize the surface of the base material. </p><p num="0036">An arc ion plating device was used as a device for forming a 
hydrogen permeable film on the surface of the porous silicon nitride base 
material processed as described above. An alloy having a composition 
comprised of 90% by mass of palladium and 10% by mass of platinum, i.e. a 
raw material for the hydrogen permeable film, was set as a target within a 
chamber in the arc ion plating device, the base material and the target 
being spaced by the distance of 300mm. The pressure in the chamber in 
the arc ion plating device was set to 2.66 x 10<sup>-3</sup>Pa (2 x 10<sup>-5</sup>Torr) and then 
the bias voltage and arc current were set at -1000V and 80A, respectively, 
in order to provide a potential difference between the base material and the 
target, and the device was operated for 10 minutes. Thus, a palladium-platinum 
alloy film having a thickness of 0.3µm was formed on the surface 
of the base material. </p><p num="0037">For the hydrogen permeable structure manufactured as described 
above, a heat cycle test was performed 100 cycles at a temperature between 
400°C and the room temperature in a hydrogen gas atmosphere of 
101.325kPa (1 atmospheric pressure). Subsequent to the test, the film was 
examined for peeling by visual observation and for cracks by electron 
microscopic observation, which showed that no physical deterioration of the 
film such as peeling or cracks was observed. It is noted that the amount of  
 
hydrogen dissolution per 100g of an alloy having a composition comprised 
of 90% by mass of palladium and 10% by mass of platinum was, when 
measured by the method described earlier, 8mg. Moreover, when 
202.65kPa (2 atmospheric pressure) of hydrogen gas was supplied while the 
hydrogen gas on the permeation side was set as 101.325kPa (1 atmospheric 
pressure), the amount of hydrogen gas permeation was 100cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>/min at 
the temperature of 350°C. </p><p num="0038">Further, when the hydrogen permeable structure was used to purify 
hydrogen-containing gas at the temperature of 400°C, the palladium-platinum 
alloy film showed good hydrogen gas permeability without 
peeling off from the base material, allowing hydrogen gas with high purity 
to be obtained. </p><heading>[Comparative Example 1]</heading><p num="0039">A hydrogen permeable structure was manufactured as in Example 1, 
except that metal of palladium alone for a raw material of a hydrogen 
permeable film was set as a target within the chamber in the arc ion 
plating device. The obtained hydrogen permeable structure was subjected 
to a heat cycle test under a condition similar to that in Example 1. After 
ten cycles, the film was examined for peeling by visual observation and for 
cracks by electron microscopic observation, which showed that partial 
peeling of the film was observed by visual observation while cracks were 
observed on the film by the electron microscopic observation. It is noted 
that, for the metal of palladium alone, the amount of hydrogen dissolution 
per 100g of metal was 15mg. The amount of hydrogen gas permeation was, 
when measured under the condition similar to that in Example 1, 
50cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>/min. </p><heading>[Comparative Example 2]</heading><p num="0040">A hydrogen permeable structure was manufactured as in Example 1, 
except that an alloy having a composition comprised of 75% by mass of 
palladium and 25% by mass of silver for a raw material of a hydrogen 
permeable film was set as a target within the chamber in the arc ion 
plating device. The obtained hydrogen permeable structure was subjected 
to a heat cycle-test under a condition similar to that in Example 1. The  
 
result revealed that the film was entirely peeled after one cycle of the heat 
cycle test and completely off the base material. It is noted that the amount 
of hydrogen dissolution was 75mg per 100g of the alloy having a 
composition comprised of 75% by mass of palladium and 25% by mass of 
silver. Because of the peeling, this sample could not be measured for the 
amount of hydrogen gas permeation. </p><heading>[Comparative Example 3]</heading><p num="0041">A hydrogen permeable structure was manufactured as in Example 1, 
except that metal of palladium alone for a raw material of a hydrogen 
permeable film was set as a target within the chamber in the arc ion 
plating device. The obtained hydrogen permeable structure was subjected 
to a heat cycle test for 100 cycles in atmospheric air of 101.325kPa (1 
atmospheric pressure) at a temperature between 400°C and the room 
temperature. Subsequent to the test, the film was examined for peeling by 
visual observation and for cracks by electron microscopic observation, 
which showed that no physical deterioration of the film such as peeling or 
cracks was observed. </p><p num="0042">As described above, comparison between Example 1 and 
Comparative Examples 1 and 2 shows that there is a clear relevance 
between the amount of hydrogen dissolution into the hydrogen permeable 
film and durability of the hydrogen permeable structure, and that the 
hydrogen permeable structure in Example 1 according to the present 
invention is superior in durability. Moreover, in Comparative Example 3, 
a heat cycle test was performed in the atmospheric air for the hydrogen 
permeable structure having a hydrogen permeable film of palladium metal 
alone, the result of which shows that heat expansion of the film has a small 
effect on durability of the hydrogen permeable structure, and that it is the 
expansion of the film due to hydrogen dissolution into the film in hydrogen 
gas atmosphere that mainly lowers durability. </p><p num="0043">It should be appreciated that the embodiments and examples
