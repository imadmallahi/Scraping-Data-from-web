The invention is also directed to HCV vectors, e.g., for gene therapy or gene vaccines.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading>Brief general overview of hepatitis C virus</heading><p>After the development of diagnostic tests for hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus, an additional agent, which could be experimentally transmitted to chimpanzees [Alter et al., Lancet 1, 459-463 (1978); Hollinger et al., Intervirology 10, 60-68 (1978); Tabor et al., Lancet 1, 463-466 (1978 )], became recognized as the major cause of transfusion-acquired hepatitis. cDNA clones corresponding to the causative non-A non-B (NANB) hepatitis agent, called hepatitis C virus (HCV), were reported in 1989 [Choo et al., Science 244, 359-362 (1989 )]. This breakthrough has led to rapid advances in diagnostics, and in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and molecular virology of HCV (see Houghton et al., Curr Stud Hematol Blood Transfus 61, 1-11 (1994) for review). Evidence of HCV infection is found throughout the world, and the prevalence of HCV-specific antibodies ranges from 0.4-2% in most countries to more than 14% in Egypt [Hibbs et al., J. Inf. Dis. 168, 789-790 (1993)]. Besides transmission via blood or blood products, or less frequently by sexual and congenital routes, sporadic cases, not associated with known risk factors, occur and account for more than 40% of HCV cases [Alter et al., J. Am. Med. Assoc. 264, 2231-2235 (1990); Mast and Alter, Semin. Virol. 4, 273-283 (1993)]. Infections are usually chronic [Alter et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 327, 1899-1905 (1992)], and clinical outcomes range from an inapparent carrier state to acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, and cirrhosis which is strongly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>Although interferon (IFN)-α has been shown to be useful for the treatment of a minority of patients with chronic HCV infections [Davis et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321, 1501-1506 (1989); DiBisceglie et al., New Engl. J. Med. 321, 1506-1510 (1989)] and subunit vaccines show some promise in the chimpanzee model [Choo et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 1294-1298 (1994)], future efforts are needed to develop more effective therapies and vaccines. The considerable diversity observed among different HCV isolates [for review, see Bukh et al., Sem. Liver Dis. 15, 41-63 (1995)], the emergence of genetic variants in chronically infected individuals [Enomoto et al., J. Hepatol. 17, 415-416 (1993); Hijikata et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 175, 220-228 (1991); Kato et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 189, 119-127 (1992); Kato et al., J. Virol. 67, 3923-3930 (1993); Kurosaki et al., Hepatology 18, 1293-1299 (1993); Lesniewski et al., J. Med. Virol. 40, 150-156 (1993); Ogata et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 3392-3396 (1991); Weiner et al., Virology 180, 842-848 (1991); Weiner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 3468-3472 (1992)], and the lack of protective immunity elicited after HCV infection [Farci et al., Science 258, 135-140 (1992); Prince et al., J. Infect. Dis. 165, 438-443 (1992)] present major challenges towards these goals.</p><heading>Molecular Biology of HCV</heading><p>Classification. Based on its genome structure and virion properties, HCV has been classified as a separate genus in the flavivirus family, which includes two other genera: the flaviviruses (e.g., yellow fever (YF) virus) and the animal pestiviruses (e.g., bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV)) [Francki et al., Arch. Virol. Suppl. 2, 223 (1991)]. All members of this family have enveloped virions that contain a positive-strand RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins via translation of a single long open reading frame (ORF).</p><p>Structure and physical properties of the virion. Little information is available on the structure and replication of HCV. Studies have been hampered by the lack of a cell culture system able to support efficient virus replication and the typically low titers of infectious virus present in serum. The size of infectious virus, based on filtration experiments, is between 30-80 nm [Bradley et al., Gastroenterology 88, 773-779 (1985); He et al., J. Infect. Dis. 156, 636-640 (1987); Yuasa et al., J. Gen. Virol. 72, 2021-2024 (1991)]. Initial measurements of the buoyant density of infectious material in sucrose yielded a range of values, with the majority present in a low density pool of &amp;lt;1.1 g/ml [Bradley et al., J. Med. Virol. 34, 206-208 (1991)]. Subsequent studies have used RT/PCR to detect HCV-specific RNA as an indirect measure of potentially infectious virus present in sera from chronically infected humans or experimentally infected chimpanzees. From these studies, it has become increasingly clear that considerable heterogeneity exists between different clinical samples, and that many factors can affect the behavior of particles containing HCV RNA [Hijikata et al., J. Virol. 67, 1953-1958 (1993); Thomssen et al., Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 181, 293-300 (1992)]. Such factors include association with immunoglobulins [Hijikata et al., (1993) supra] or low density lipoprotein [Thomssen et al., 1992, supra; Thomssen et al., Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 182, 329-334 (1993)]. In highly infectious acute phase chimpanzee serum, HCV-specific RNA is usually detected in fractions of low buoyant density (1.03-1.1 g/ml) [Carrick et al., J. Virol. Meth. 39, 279-289 (1992); Hijikata et al., (1993) supra]. In other samples, the presence of HCV antibodies and formation of immune complexes correlate with particles of higher density and lower infectivity [Hijikata et al., (1993) supra]. Treatment of particles with chloroform, which destroys infectivity [Bradley et al., J. Infect. Dis. 148, 254-265 (1983); Feinstone et al., Infect. Immun. 41, 816-821 (1983)], or with nonionic detergents, produced RNA containing particles of higher density (1.17-1.25 g/ml) believed to represent HCV nucleocapsids [Hijikata et al., (1993) supra; Kanto et al., Hepatology 19, 296-302 (1994); Miyamoto et al., J. Gen. Virol. 73, 715-718 (1992)].</p><p>There have been reports of negative-sense HCV-specific RNAs in sera and plasma [see Fong et al., Journal of Clinical Investigation 88:1058-60 (1991)]. However, it seems unlikely that such RNAs are essential components of infectious particles since some sera with high infectivity can have low or undetectable levels of negative-strand RNA [Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6037-6041 (1993)].</p><p>The virion protein composition has not been rigorously determined, but putative HCV structural proteins include a basic C protein and two membrane glycoproteins, E1 and E2.</p><p>HCV replication. Early events in HCV replication are poorly understood. Cellular receptors for the HCV glycoproteins have not been identified. The association of some HCV particles with beta-lipoprotein and immunoglobulins raises the possibility that these host molecules may modulate virus uptake and tissue tropism. Studies examining HCV replication have been largely restricted to human patients or experimentally inoculated chimpanzees. In the chimpanzee model, HCV RNA is detected in the serum as early as three days post-inoculation and persists through the peak of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (an indicator of liver damage) [Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 6441-6444 (1990)]. The onset of viremia is followed by the appearance of indirect hallmarks of HCV infection of the liver. These include the appearance of a cytoplasmic antigen [Shimizu et al., (1990) supra] and ultrastructural changes in hepatocytes such as the formation of microtubular aggregates for which HCV previously was referred to as the chloroform-sensitive "tubule forming agent" or "TFA" [reviewed by Bradley, Prog. Med. Virol. 37: 101-135 (1990)]. As shown by the appearance of viral antigens [Blight et al., Amer. J. Path. 143:1568-1573 (1993); Hiramatsu et al., Hepatology 16:306-311(1992); Krawczynski et al., Gastroenterology 103: 622-629 (1992); Yamada et al., Digest. Dis. Sci. 38: 882-887 (1993)] and the detection of positive and negative sense RNAs [Fong et al., (1991) supra; Gunji et al., Arch. Virol. 134: 293-302 (1994); Haruna et al., J. Hepatol. 18: 96-100 (1993); Lamas et al., J. Hepatol. 16: 219-223 (1992); Nouri Aria et al., J. Clin. Inves. 91: 2226-34 (1993); Sherker et al., J. Med. Virol. 39: 91-96 (1993); Takehara et al., Hepatology 15: 387-390 (1992); Tanaka et al., Liver 13: 203-208 (1993)], hepatocytes appear to be a major site of HCV replication, particularly during acute infection [Negro et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 2247-2251 (1992)]. In later stages of HCV infection the appearance of HCV-specific antibodies, the persistence or resolution of viremia, and the severity of liver disease, vary greatly both in the chimpanzee model and in human patients. Although some liver damage may occur as a direct consequence of HCV infection and cytopathogenicity, the emerging consensus is that host immune responses, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, may play a more dominant role in mediating cellular damage.</p><p>It has been speculated that HCV may also replicate in extra-hepatic reservoir(s). In some cases, RT/PCR or in situ hybridization has shown an association of HCV RNA with peripheral blood mononuclear cells including T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes reviewed in Blight and Gowans, Viral Hepatitis Rev. 1: 143-155 (1995)]. Such tissue tropism could be relevant to the establishment of chronic infections and might also play a role in the association between HCV infection and certain immunological abnormalities such as mixed cryoglobulinemia [reviewed by Ferri et al., Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 23: 399-405 (1993)], glomerulonephritis, and rare non-Hodgkin's B-lymphomas [Ferri et al., (1993) supra; Kagawa et al., Lancet 341: 316-317 (1993)]. However, the detection of circulating negative strand RNA in serum, the difficulty in obtaining truly strand-specific RT/PCR [Gunji et al., (1994) supra], and the low numbers of apparently infected cells have made it difficult to obtain unambiguous evidence for replication in these tissues in vivo.</p><p>Genome structure. Full-length or nearly full-length genome sequences of numerous HCV isolates have been reported [see Lin et al., J. Virol. 68: 5063-5073 (1994a); Okamoto et al., J. Gen. Virol. 75: 629-635 (1994); Sakamoto et al., J. Gen. Virol. 75: 1761-1768 (1994) and citations therein]. Given the considerable genetic divergence among isolates, it is clear that several major HCV genotypes are distributed throughout the world. Those of greatest importance in the U.S. are genotype 1, subtypes 1a and 1b (see below and Ref. Bukh et al., (1995) supra for a discussion of genotype prevalence and distribution). HCV genome RNAs are ˜9.6 kilobases in length (FIG. 1). The 5' NTR is 341-344 bases long and highly conserved. The length of the long ORF varies slightly among isolates, encoding polyproteins of 3010, 3011 or 3033 amino acids. The reported 3' NTR structures show considerable diversity both in composition and length (28-42 bases), and appear to terminate with poly (U) (see Chen et al., Virology 188:102-113 (1992); Okamoto et al., J. Gen. Virol. 72:2697-2704 (1991); Tokita et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66:1476-83 (1994)] except in one case (HCV-1, type 1a) which appears to contain a 3' terminal poly (A) tract [Han et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1711-1715 (1991)]. In contrast, our recent analysis suggests that the genome RNA of the H-strain (also type 1a) contains an internal polypyrimidine tract followed by a novel RNA element [pending patent application Ser. No. 08/520,678, filed Aug. 29, 1995, and International Patent Application No. PCT/US96/14033, filed Aug. 28, 1996]. The results presented in pending application Ser. No. 08/520,678 show that the genome RNA of this type 1a isolate does not terminate with a homopolymer tract as previously thought, but rather with a novel sequence of ˜98 bases. Furthermore, this 3' NTR structure and the novel 3' terminal element are features common to all HCV genotypes which have thus far been examined [Kolykhalov et al., J. Virol. 70: 3363-3371 (1996); Tanaka et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 215: 744-749 (1996); Tanaka et al., J. Virol. 70:3307-12 (1996); Yamada et al., Virology 223:255-261 (1996)].</p><p>Translation and proteolytic processing. Several studies have used cell-free translation and transient expression in cell culture to examine the role of the 5' NTR in translation initiation [Fukushi et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 199: 425-432 (1994); Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., J. Virol. 66: 1476-1483 (1992); Wang et al., J. Virol. 67: 3338-3344 (1993); Yoo et al., Virology 191: 889-899 (1992)]. This highly conserved sequence contains multiple short AUG-initiated ORFs and shows significant homology with the 5' NTR region of pestiviruses [Bukh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4942-4946 (1992); Han et al., (1991) supra]. A series of stem-loop structures have been proposed on the basis of computer modeling and sensitivity to digestion by different ribonucleases [Brown et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 20: 5041-5045 (1992); Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., (4992) supra]. The results from several groups indicate that this element functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allowing efficient translation initiation at the first AUG of the long ORF [Fukushi et al., (1994) supra; Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., (1992) supra; Wang et al., (1993) supra; Yoo et al., (1992) supra]. Some of the predicted features of the HCV and pestivirus IRES elements are similar to one another [Brown et al., (1992) supra]. The ability of this element to function as an IRES suggests that HCV genome RNAs may lack a 5' cap structure.</p><p>The organization and processing of the HCV polyprotein (FIG. 1) appears to be most similar to that of the pestiviruses. At least 10 polypeptides have been identified and the order of these cleavage products in the polyprotein is NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH. As shown in FIG. 1, proteolytic processing is mediated by host signal peptidase and two HCV-encoded proteinases, the NS2-3 autoproteinase and the NS3-4A serine proteinase [see Rice, In "Fields Virology" (B. N. Fields, D. M. Knipe and P. M. Howley, Eds.), Vol. pp. 931-960. Raven Press, New York (1996); Shimotohno et al., J. Hepatol. 22: 87-92 (1995) for reviews]. C is a basic protein believed to be the viral core or capsid protein; E1 and E2 are putative virion envelope glycoproteins; p7 is a hydrophobic protein of unknown function that is inefficiently cleaved from the E2 glycoprotein [Lin et al., (1994a) supra; Mizushima et al., J. Virol. 68: 6215-6222 (1994); Selby et al., Virology 204: 114-122 (1994)], and NS2-NS5B are likely nonstructural (NS) proteins which function in viral RNA replication complexes. In particular, besides its N-terminal serine proteinase domain, NS3 contains motifs characteristic of RNA helicases and has been shown to possess an RNA-stimulated NTPase activity [Suzich et al., J. Virot. 67, 6152-6158 (1993)]; NS5B contains the GDD motif characteristic of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of positive-strand RNA viruses.</p><p>HCV RNA replication. By analogy with flaviviruses, replication of the positive-sense HCV virion RNA is thought to occur via a minus-strand intermediate. This strategy can be described briefly as follows: (i) uncoating of the incoming virus particle releases the genomic plus-strand, which is translated to produce a single long polyprotein that is probably processed co- and post-translationally to produce individual structural and nonstructural proteins; (ii) the nonstructural proteins presumably form a replication complex that utilizes the virion RNA as template for the synthesis of minus strands; (iii) these minus strands in turn serve as templates for synthesis of plus strands, which can be used for additional translation of viral protein, minus strand synthesis, or packaging into progeny virions. Very few details about HCV replication process are available, due to the lack of a good experimental system for virus propagation. Detailed analyses of authentic HCV replication and other steps in the viral life cycle would be greatly facilitated by the development of an efficient system for HCV replication in cell culture.</p><p>Many attempts have been made to infect cultured cells with serum collected from HCV-infected individuals, and low levels of replication have been reported in a number of cells types infected by this method, including B-cell [Bertolini et al., Res. Virol. 144: 281-285 (1993); Nakajima et al., J. Virol. 70: 9925-9 (1996); Valli et al., Res. Virol. 146:285-288 (1995)]. T-cell (Kato et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 206:863-9 (1996); Mizutani et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 227:822-826; Mizutani et al., J. Virol. 70: 7219-7223 (1996); Nakajima et al., (1996) supra; Shimizu and Yoshikura, J. Virol, 68: 8406-8408 (1994); Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 5477-5481 (1992); Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 6037-6041 (1993)], and hepatocyte [Kato et al., Jpn. J. Cancer Res., 87: 787-92 (1996); Tagawa, J. Gastoenterol. and Hepatol., 10: 523-527 (1995)] cell lines, as well as peripheral blood monocular cells (PBMCs) [Cribier et al., J. Gen. Virol., 76: 2485-2491 (1995)], and primary cultures of human fetal hepatocytes [Carloni et al., Arch. Virol. Suppl. 8: 31-39 (1993); Cribier et al., (1995) supra; Iacovacci et al., Res. Virol., 144: 275-279 (1993)] or hepatocytes from adult chimpanzees [Lanford et al., Virology 202: 606-14 (1994)]. HCV replication has also been detected in primary hepatocytes derived from a human HCV patient that were infected with the virus in vivo prior to cultivation [Ito et al., J. Gen. Virol. 77: 1043-1054 (1996)] and in the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 following transfection with RNA transcribed in vitro from an HCV-1 cDNA clone [Yoo et al., J. Virol., 69: 32-38 (1995)]. The reported observation of replication in cells transfected with RNA derived from the HCV-1 clone was puzzling, since this clone lacks the 3'NTR sequence downstream of the homopolymer tract (see below). The most well-characterized cell-culture systems for HCV replication utilize a B-cell line (Daudi) or T-cell lines persistently infected with retroviruses (HPB-Ma or MT-2) [Kato et al., (1995) supra; Mizutani et al., Biochem Biophys Res. Comm., 227: 822-826 (1996a); Mizutani et al., (1996) supra; Nakajima et al., (1996) supra; Shimizu and Yoshikura, (1994) supra]; Shimizu, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 6037-6041 (1993)]. HPBMa is infected with an amphotropic murine leukemia virus pseudotype of murine sarcoma virus, while MT-2 is infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). Clones (HPBMa10-2 and MT-2C) that support HCV replication more efficiently than the uncloned population have been isolated for the two T-cell lines HPBMa and MT-2 [Mizutani et al. J. Virol. (1996) supra; Shimizu et al., (1993) supra]. However, the maximum levels of RNA replication obtained in these lines or in the Daudi lines after degradation of the input RNA is still only about 5 molecules per 10.sup.6 cells [Mizutani et al., (1996) supra; Mizutani et al., (1996) supra] or 10.sup.4 RNA molecules per ml of culture medium [Nakajima et al., (1996) supra]. Although the level of replication is low, long-term infections of up to 198 days in one system [Mizutani et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 227: 822-826 (1996a)] and more than a year in another system [Nakajima et al., (1996) supra] have been documented, and infectious virus production has been demonstrated by serial cell-free or cell-mediated passage of the virus to naive cells.</p><p>However, efficient HCV replication has not been observed in any of the cell-culture systems described to date, and all of the groups that have attempted to establish such systems have encountered a number of problems, including the difficulty in distinguishing input RNA from plus strands produced by replication, the false detection of minus strands, and generally low titers of replicated RNA. Thus, despite these advances, more efficient cell-culture systems for HCV propagation are needed for the production of concentrated virus stocks, structural analysis of virion components, and improved analyses of intracellular viral processes, including RNA replication.</p><p>Virion assembly and release. This process has not been examined directly, but the lack of complex glycans, the ER localization of expressed HCV glycoproteins [Dubuisson et al., J. Virol. 68: 6147-6160 (1994); Ralston et al., J. Virol. 67: 6753-6761 (1993)] and the absence of these proteins on the cell surface [Dubuisson et al., (1994) supra; Spaete et al., Virology 188: 819-830 (1992)] suggest that initial virion morphogenesis may occur by budding into intracellular vesicles. Thus far, efficient particle formation and release has not been observed in transient expression assays, suggesting that essential viral or host factors are absent or blocked. HCV virion formation and release may be inefficient, since a substantial fraction of the virus remains cell-associated, as found for the pestiviruses. A recent study indicates that extracellular HCV particles partially purified from human plasma contain complex N-linked glycans, although these carbohydrate moieties were not shown to be specifically associated with E1 or E2 [Sato et al., Virology 196: 354-357 (1993)]. Complex glycans associated with glycoproteins on released virions would suggest transit through the trans-Golgi and movement of virions through the host secretory pathway. If this is correct, intracellular sequestration of HCV glycoproteins and virion formation might then play a role in the establishment of chronic infections by minimizing immune surveillance and preventing lysis of virus-infected cells via antibody and complement.</p><p>Genetic variability. As for all positive-strand RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) of HCV (NS5B) is believed to lack a 3'-5' exonuclease proof reading activity for removal of misincorporated bases. Replication is therefore error-prone, leading to a "quasi-species" virus population consisting of a large number of variants [Martell et al., J. Virol. 66: 3225-3229 (1992); Martell et al., J. Virol. 68: 3425-3436 (1994)]. This variability is apparent at multiple levels. First, in a chronically infected individual, changes in the virus population occur over time [Ogata et al., (1991) supra; Okamoto et al., Virology 190: 894-899 (1992)]; and these changes may have important consequences for disease. A particularly interesting example is the N-terminal 30 residue segment of the E2 glycoprotein, which exhibits a much higher degree of variability than the rest of the polyprotein [for examples, see Higashi et al., Virology 197, 659-668. 1993; Hijikata et al., (1991) supra; Weiner et al., (1991) supra]. There is accumulating evidence that this hypervariable region, perhaps analogous to the V3 domain of HIV-1 gp120, may be under immune selection by circulating HCV-specific antibodies [Kato et al., (1993) supra; Taniguchi et al., Virology 195: 297-301 (1993); Weiner et al., (1992) supra. In this model, antibodies directed against this portion of E2 may contribute to virus neutralization and thus drive the selection of variants with substitutions that permit escape from neutralization. This plasticity suggests that a specific amino acid sequence in the E2 hypervariable region is not essential for other functions of the protein such as virion attachment, penetration, or assembly.</p><p>Genetic variability may also contribute to the spectrum of different responses observed after IFN-α treatment of chronically infected patients. Diminished serum ALT levels and improved liver histology, which usually correlates with a decrease in the level of circulating HCV RNA, is seen in ˜40% of those treated [Greiser-Wilke et al., J. Gen. Virol. 72: 2015-2019 (1991)]. After treatment, approximately 70% of the responders relapse. In some cases, after a transient loss of circulating viral RNA, renewed viremia is observed during or after the course of treatment. While this might suggest the existence or generation of IFN-resistant HCV genotypes or variants, further work is needed to determine the relative contributions of virus genotype and host-specific differences in immune response.</p><p>Finally, sequence comparisons of different HCV isolates around the world have revealed enormous genetic diversity [reviewed in Ref. Bukh et al., (1995) supra]. Because of the lack biologically relevant serological assays such as cross-neutralization tests, HCV types (designated by numbers), subtypes (designated by letters), and isolates are currently grouped on the basis of nucleotide or amino acid sequence similarity. Amino acid sequence similarity between the most divergent genotypes can be a little as ˜50%, depending upon the protein being compared. This diversity has important biological implications, particularly for diagnosis, vaccine design, and therapy.</p><heading>Attempts by others to generate infectious HCV transcripts from cDNA</heading><p>A recent paper [Yoo et al., J. Virol. 69: 32-38 (1995)] reports replication of transcribed HCV-1 RNA after transfection of Huh7 cells. In this paper, T7 transcripts from various derivatives of an HCV-1 cDNA clone were tested for their ability to replicate following transfection of the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7. Possible HCV replication was assessed by strand-specific RT/PCR (using 5' NTR primers) and metabolic labeling of HCV-specific RNAs with .sup.3 H-uridine. Apparently full-length transcripts, terminating with either poly (A) or poly (U), were positive by these assays, but those with a deletion of the 5' terminal 144 bases were not. In some cultures, HCV-specific RNA was detected in the culture media and this putative virus was used to reinfect fresh Huh7 cells.</p><p>The present inventors have been unable to reproduce these results. It appears that this report describes transient replication, rather than authentic HCV infection, with replication and virus production. Some of the data appear self-contradictory. For instance, the positive control reported in this paper was productive transfection of Huh7 cells with RNA extracted from 1 ml of high HCV titer chimpanzee plasma. This extracted sample would contain a maximum of 10' potentially infectious full-length HCV RNA molecules. Under optimum transfection conditions (other than microinjection), greater than 10.sup.5 RNA molecules of virion RNA (at least for poliovirus, Sindbis virus, or YF) are typically required to initiate a single infectious event. This suggests that in the reported HCV-1 experiment fewer than 100 cells would be productively transfected. Furthermore, at 16 days post-transfection, both positive- and negative-strand RNAs were reportedly detected after eight hours of metabolic labeling. The detection of negative-strand RNA by this method (both for transfected virion RNA and transcript RNA) suggests that HCV is capable of both efficient replication and spread, and that the level of HCV RNA synthesis is similar to that which would be expected for a more robust flavivirus, such as YF (at the peak of a high multiplicity infection). Yet Yoo et al. did not report detection of HCV antigens in these cells using a variety of antisera, nor were they able to report detection of full-length positive- or negative-strands by Northern analysis (which is much more sensitive than metabolic labeling with .sup.3 H-uridine). Finally, the critical experiment, demonstrating that RNA or virus derived from the HCV-1 clone is infectious in the chimpanzee model, has not been reported.</p><heading>Importance of Infectious Clone Technology for HCV Research</heading><p>Despite the great deal of progress made in the last several years a vast number of questions concerning HCV replication, pathogenesis, and immunity remain unanswered. The field is rapidly reaching a bottleneck where we understand some aspects of the functions of the HCV RNA genome and its encoded proteins, but have no way of experimentally testing structure/function questions in the context of authentic virus replication. Such analyses are critical for understanding each step in the virus life cycle to enable the design of protective vaccines, effective therapy, and HCV diagnostics.</p><p>Thus, there is a need in the art for authentic HCV genetic material for expression of infectious HCV RNA.</p><p>There is a further need in the art for authentic genetic material for expression of native HCV virions and viral particle proteins, which can, in turn, permit characterization of HCV virion structure.</p><p>The art also requires an in vitro culture method for infectious HCV, which would permit analysis of HCV receptor binding, cellular infection, replication, virion assembly, and release.</p><p>These and other needs in the art are addressed by the present invention.</p><p>The citation of any reference herein should not be construed as an admission that such reference is available as "Prior Art" to the instant application.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention advantageously provides an authentic hepatitis C virus (HCV) DNA clone capable of replication, expression of functional HCV proteins, and infection in vivo and in vitro for development of antiviral therapeutics and diagnostics.</p><p>In a broad aspect, the present invention is directed to a genetically engineered hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleic acid clone which comprises from 5' to 3' on the positive-sense nucleic acid a functional 5' non-translated region (NTR) comprising an extreme 5'-terminal conserved sequence, an open reading frame (ORF) encoding at least a portion of an HCV polyprotein whose cleavage products form functional components of HCV virus particles and RNA replication machinery, and a 3' non-translated region (NTR) comprising an extreme 3'-terminal conserved sequence, or a derivative thereof selected from the group consisting of adapted virus, live-attenuated virus, replication-competent non-infectious virus, and defective virus. It has been found by the present inventors that various manipulations, effected using genetic engineering techniques, are required to produce an authentic HCV nucleic acid, e.g., a cDNA that can be transcribed to produce infectious HCV RNA, or an infectious HCV RNA. By providing engineered authentic HCV nucleic acids, the present inventors have for the first time enabled dissection of HCV replication machinery and protein activity, and preparation of various HCV derivatives. Previously, since there was uncertainty about whether any given HCV clone contained an error or mutation that led to its inability to function, one could not be certain that starting material for further analysis of HCV was useful or simply due to an artifact. Thus, a major advantage of the present invention is that it provides authentic HCV, thus assuring that any modifications result in real changes rather than artifacts due to errors in the clones provided in the prior art.</p><p>A further advantage of the present invention is recognition of the characteristics of an infectious HCV genome, particularly in the polyprotein coding region. In a specific embodiment, the HCV nucleic acid has a consensus nucleic acid sequence determined from the sequence of a majority of at least three clones of an HCV isolate or genotype. Preferably, the HCV nucleic acid has at least a functional portion of a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:1, which represents a specific embodiment of the present invention exemplified herein. It should be noted that while SEQ ID NO:1 is a DNA sequence, the present invention contemplates the corresponding RNA sequence, and DNA and RNA complementary sequences as well. In a further embodiment, a region from an HCV isolate is substituted for a homologous region, e.g., of an HCV nucleic acid having a sequence of SEQ ID NO:1. In a further preferred embodiment, exemplified herein, the HCV nucleic acid is a DNA that codes on expression for a replication-competent HCV RNA replicon, or is itself a replication-competent HCV RNA replicon. In a specific example, infra, an HCV nucleic acid of the invention has a full length sequence as depicted in or corresponding to SEQ ID NO:1. Various modifications of the 5' and 3' are also contemplated by the invention. For example, the 5'-terminal sequence can be homologous or complementary to an RNA sequence selected from the group consisting of GCCAGCC; GGCCAGCC; UGCCAGCC; AGCCAGCC; AAGCCAGCC; GAGCCAGCC; GUGCCAGCC; and GCGCCAGCC, wherein the sequence GCCAGCC is the 5'-terminus of SEQ ID NO:3.</p><p>Still another advantage of the present invention is the demonstration of the importance of the complete 3'-NTR for an infectious HCV clone. The 3'-NTR, particularly the approximately 98 base extreme terminal sequence, which is highly conserved among HCV genotypes, is the subject of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/520,678, filed Aug. 29, 1995, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and PCT International Application No. PCT/US96/14033, filed Aug. 28, 1996, which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Thus, in a preferred aspect, the functional 3'-NTR comprises a 3'-terminal sequence of approximately 98 bases that is highly conserved among HCV genotypes. In a specific embodiment, the 3'-NTR extreme terminus is homologous or complementary to a DNA having the sequence 5 '-GGTGGCTCCATCTTAGCCCTAGTCACGGCTAGCTGTGAAAGGTCCGTGAGCCG CATGACTGCAGAGAGTGCTGATACTGGCCTCTCTGCTGATCATGT-3' (SEQ ID NO:4). In a specific embodiment, exemplified in SEQ ID NO:1, the 3'-NTR comprises a long poly-pyrimidine region (e.g., about 133 bases); however, alternative length polypyrimidine regions are also encompassed, including short regions (about 75 bases), or regions that are shorter or longer. Naturally, in a positive strand HCV DNA nucleic acid, the poly-pyrimidine region is a poly(T/TC) region, and in an positive strand HCV RNA nucleic acid, the poly-pyrimidine region is a poly(U/UC) region.</p><p>According to various aspects of the invention, and HCV nucleic acid, including the polyprotein coding region, can be mutated or engineered to produce variants or derivatives with, e.g., silent mutations, conservative mutations, etc. Such clones may also be adapted, e.g., by selection for propagation in animals or in vitro. The present invention further permits creation of HCV chimeras, in which portions of the genome for other genotypes or isolates are substituted for the homologous region of an HCV clone, such as SEQ ID NO:1 or the deposited embodiment, infra. In still other embodiments, the invention provides methods for preparing, and clones comprising, polyprotein coding sequence from an HCV genotype selected from the group consisting of the HCV-1, HCV-1a, HCV-1b, HCV-1c, HCV-2a, HCV-2b, HCV-2c, HCV-3a, and any "quasi-species" variant thereof. In a further preferred aspect, silent nucleotide changes in the polyprotein coding regions (i.e., variations of the third base of a codon that encodes the same amino acid) are incorporated as markers of specific HCV clones.</p><p>In a further aspect of the invention, an HCV nucleic acid, including attenuated and defective variants thereof, can comprise a heterologous gene operatively associated with an expression control sequence, wherein the heterologous gene and expression control sequence are oriented on the positive-strand nucleic acid molecule. In a specific embodiment, the heterologous gene is inserted by a strategy selected from the group consisting of in-frame fusion with the HCV polyprotein coding sequence; and creation of an additional cistron. The heterologous gene can be an antibiotic resistance gene or a reporter gene. Alternatively, the heterologous gene can be a therapeutic gene, or a gene encoding a vaccine antigen, i.e., for gene therapy or gene vaccine applications, respectively. In a specific embodiment, where the heterologous gene is an antibiotic resistance gene, the antibiotic resistance gene is a neomycin resistance gene operatively associated with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) inserted in an SfiI site in the 3'-NTR.</p><p>Naturally, as noted above, the HCV nucleic acid of the invention is selected from the group consisting of double stranded DNA, positive-sense cDNA, or negative-sense cDNA, or positive-sense RNA or negative-sense RNA. Thus, where particular sequences of nucleic acids of the invention are set forth, both DNA and corresponding RNA are intended, including positive and negative strands thereof.</p><p>An HCV DNA may be inserted in a plasmid vector for translation of the corresponding HCV RNA. Thus, the HCV DNA may comprise a promoter 5' of the 5'-NTR on positive-sense DNA, whereby transcription of template DNA from the promoter produces replication-competent RNA. The promoter can be selected from the group consisting of a eukaryotic promoter, yeast promoter, plant promoter, bacterial promoter, or viral promoter. In specific examples, infra, phage T7 and SP6 promoters are employed. In a specific embodiment. the present invention is directed to a plasmid clone, p90/HCVFL [long poly(U)], harboring a full-length HCV cDNA which can be transcribed to produce infectious HCV RNA transcripts as deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, USA on Feb. 13, 1997, and assigned accession no. 97879, having a sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO:5. Naturally, the invention also includes a derivative of this plasmid, selected from the group consisting of a derivative wherein a 5'-terminal sequence is homologous or complementary to an RNA sequence selected from the group consisting of GCCAGCC, GGCCAGCC, UGCCAGCC, AGCCAGCC, AAGCCAGCC, GAGCCAGCC, GUGCCAGCC, and GCGCCAGCC, wherein the sequence GCCAGCC is the 5'-terminus of SEQ ID NO:3; and a derivative wherein a 3'-NTR comprises a short poly-pyrimidine region (since the deposited embodiment has a long poly-pyrimidine region, which may be preferred). In a further embodiment, a derivative of the deposited embodiment may be selected from the group consisting of a derivative produced by substitution of homologous regions from other HCV isolates or genotypes; a derivative produced by mutagenesis; a derivative selected from the group consisting of adapted, live-attenuated, replication competent non-infectious, and defective variants; a derivative comprising a heterologous gene operatively associated with an expression control sequence; and a derivative consisting of a functional fragment of any of the above-mentioned derivatives. Alternatively, portions of the deposited DNA clone, such as the 5' NTR, the polyprotein coding regions, the 3'-NTR or more generally any coding or non-translated region of the HCV genome, can be substituted with a corresponding region from a different HCV genotype to generate a new chimeric infectious clone, or by extension, infectious clones of other isolates and genotypes. For example, an HCV-1b or -2a polyprotein coding region (or consensus polyprotein coding regions) can be substituted for the HCV-H (la strain) polyprotein coding region of the deposited clone.</p><p>Naturally, the present invention further provides an HCV DNA or RNA transcribed from the full length HCV cDNA harbored in the plasmid clones set forth above.</p><p>Thus, the specific HCV genome itself provides an excellent starting material for deriving modified variants of HCV, since any modifications will result from changes to authentic virus, rather than artifacts resulting from an accumulation of changes and errors. The HCV DNA clones or RNAs of the invention can be used in numerous methods, or to derive authentic HCV components, as set forth below.</p><p>For example, the invention provides a method for identifying a cell line that is permissive for infection with HCV, comprising contacting a cell line in tissue culture with an infectious amount of HCV RNA, e.g., as produced from the plasmid clones recited above, and detecting replication of HCV in cells of the cell line. Naturally, the invention extends as well to a method for identifying an animal that is permissive for infection with HCV, comprising introducing an infectious amount of the HCV RNA, e.g., as produced by the plasmids above, to the animal, and detecting replication of HCV in the animal. By providing authentic infectious HCV, preferably comprising a dominant selectable marker, the invention further provides a method for selecting for HCV with adaptive mutations that permit higher levels of HCV replication in a permissive cell line or animal comprising contacting a cell line in culture, or introducing into an animal, an infectious amount of the HCV RNA, and detecting progressively increasing levels of HCV RNA in the cell line or the animal. In a specific embodiment, the adaptive mutation permits modification of HCV tropism. An immediate implication of this aspect of the invention is creation of new valid animal models for HCV infection.</p><p>The permissive cell lines or animals that are identified using the nucleic acids of the invention are very useful, inter alia, for studying the natural history of HCV infection, isolating functional components of HCV, and for sensitive, fast diagnostic applications, in addition to producing authentic HCV virus or components thereof. As noted above, a particular advantage of the invention is that is represents the first successful preparation of an HCV DNA clone capable of initiating a productive infection in animals or cell lines.</p><p>Because the HCV DNA, e.g., plasmid vectors, of the invention encode authentic HCV components, expression of such vectors in a host cell line transfected, transformed, or transduced with the HCV DNA can be effected. For example, a baculovirus or plant expression system can be harnessed to express HCV virus particles or components thereof. Thus, a host cell line may be selected from the group consisting of a bacterial cell, a yeast cell, a plant cell, an insect cell, and a mammalian cell.</p><p>Because the invention provides, inter alia, infectious HCV RNA, the invention provides a method for infecting an animal with HCV which comprises administering an infectious dose of HCV RNA, such as the HCV RNA transcribed from the plasmids described above, to the animal. Naturally, the invention provides a non-human animal infected with HCV of the invention, which non-human animal can be prepared by the foregoing methods.</p><p>A further advantage of the present invention is that, by providing a complete functional HCV genome, authentic HCV viral particles or components thereof, which may be produced with native HCV proteins or RNA in a way that is not possible in subunit expression systems, can be prepared. In addition, since each component of HCV of the invention is functional (thus yielding the authentic HCV), any specific HCV component is an authentic component, i.e., lacking any errors that may, at least in part, affect the clones of the prior art. Indeed, a further advantage of the invention is the ability to generate HCV virus particles or virus particle proteins that are structurally identical to or closely related to natural HCV virions or proteins. Thus, in a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for propagating HCV in vitro comprising culturing a cell line contacted with an infectious amount of HCV RNA of the invention, e.g., HCV RNA translated from the plasmids described above, under conditions that permit replication of the HCV RNA.</p><p>Naturally, the invention extends to an in vitro cell line infected with HCV, wherein the HCV has a genomic RNA sequence as described above. In a specific embodiment, the cell line is a hepatocyte cell line. The invention further provides various methods for producing HCV virus particles, including by isolating HCV virus particles from the HCV-infected non-human animal of invention; culturing a cell line of the invention under conditions that permit HCV replication and virus particle formation; or culturing a host expression cell line transfected with HCV DNA under conditions that permit expression of HCV particle proteins; and isolating HCV particles or particle proteins from the cell culture. The present invention extends to an HCV virus particle comprising a replication-competent HCV genome RNA, or a replication-defective HCV genome RNA, corresponding to an HCV nucleic acid of the invention as well.</p><p>By providing for insertion of heterologous genes in the HCV nucleic acids, e.g., DNA or RNA vectors, the present invention provides a method for transducing an animal susceptible to HCV infection with a heterologous gene, e.g., for gene therapy or gene vaccination, by administering an amount of the HCV RNA to the animal effective to infect the animal with the HCV RNA. In a specific embodiment, such an HCV vector is generated in HCV harbored in the plasmids, described above.</p><p>Also provided is an in vitro cell-free assay system for HCV comprising HCV genomic template RNA of the invention, e.g., as transcribed from a plasmid of the invention as set forth above, functional HCV replicase components, and an isotonic buffered medium comprising ribonucleotide triphosphate bases. These elements provide the replication machinery and raw materials (NTPs).</p><p>The authentic HCV viral particles and viral particle proteins are a preferred starting material as HCV antigens. Thus, in a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing antibodies to HCV comprising administering an immunogenic amount of HCV virus particles to an animal, and isolating anti-HCV antibodies from the animal. Such antibodies may be used diagnostically, e.g., to detect the presence of HCV, or they may be used therapeutically, e.g., in passive immunotherapy. A further method for producing antibodies to HCV comprises screening a human antibody library for reactivity with HCV virus particles of the invention and selecting a clone from the library that expresses an antibody reactive with the HCV virus particle. Naturally, in addition to generating antibodies, the authentic HCV viral particles and proteins of the invention represent preferred starting materials for an HCV vaccine. Preferably, a vaccine of the invention includes a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant.</p><p>The authentic materials provided herein provide a method for screening for agents capable of modulating HCV replication in vitro and in vivo. Such methods include administering a candidate agent to an HCV infected animal of the invention, and testing for an increase or decrease in a level of HCV infection or activity compared to a level of HCV infection or activity in the animal prior to administration of the candidate agent, wherein a decrease in the level of HCV infection or activity compared to the level of HCV infection or activity in the animal prior to administration of the candidate agent is indicative of the ability of the agent to inhibit HCV infection or activity. Testing for the level of HCV infection can be performed by measuring viral titer in a tissue sample from the animal; measuring viral proteins in a tissue sample from the animal; or measuring liver enzymes. Alternatively, the HCV genome used to infect the animal may include a heterologous gene operatively associated with an expression control sequence, wherein the heterologous gene and expression control sequence are oriented on the positive-strand nucleic acid molecule, and testing for the level of HCV activity comprises measuring the level of a marker protein in a tissue sample from the animal.</p><p>Alternatively, such analysis can proceed in vitro, e.g., by contacting the cell line of claim 32 with a candidate agent; and testing for an increase or decrease in a level of HCV infection or activity compared to a level of HCV infection or activity in a control cell line or in the cell line prior to administration of the candidate agent; wherein a decrease in the level of HCV infection or activity compared to the level of HCV infection or activity in a control cell line or in the cell line prior to administration of the candidate agent is indicative of the ability of the agent to inhibit HCV infection or activity. Testing for the level of HCV infection in vitro can be performed by measuring viral titer in the cells, culture medium, or both; and measuring viral proteins in the cells, culture medium, or both. Alternatively, when the HCV genome used to infect the cell line includes a heterologous gene operatively associated with an expression control sequence, wherein the heterologous gene and expression control sequence are oriented on the positive-strand nucleic acid molecule, and testing for the level of HCV activity comprises measuring the level of a marker protein in a tissue sample from the animal.</p><p>A further method for screening for agents capable of modulating HCV replication involves the cell free system described above. This method comprises contacting the in vitro system of the invention with a candidate agent; and testing for an increase or decrease in a level of HCV replication compared to a level of HCV replication in a control cell system or system prior to administration of the candidate agent; wherein a decrease in the level of HCV replication compared to the level of HCV replication in a control cell line or in the cell line prior to administration of the candidate agent is indicative of the ability of the agent to inhibit HCV infection or activity.</p><p>The invention includes a method for preparing an HCV nucleic acid comprising joining from 5' to 3' on the positive-sense DNA a functional 5' non-translated region (NTR) comprising an extreme 5'-terminal conserved sequence, a polyprotein coding region encoding HCV proteins that provide for expression of functional HCV proteins, and a 3' non-translated region (NTR) comprising an extreme 3'-terminal conserved sequence. The method may further comprise determining a consensus sequence for the 5'-NTR, polyprotein coding sequence, and 3'-NTR from a majority sequence of at least three clones of an HCV isolate or genotype. In a specific embodiment, the 3'-NTR comprises an extreme terminal sequence homologous to a DNA having the sequence 5 '-GGTGGCTCCATCTTAGCCCTAGTCACGGCTAGCTGTGAAAGGTCCGTGAGCCG CATGACTGCAGAGAGTGCTGATACTGGCCTCTCTGCTGATCATGT-3' (SEQ ID NO:4). In a further specific embodiment, the HCV nucleic acid has a positive strand sequence as depicted in or corresponding to SEQ ID NO:1 comprising substitution of a homologous region from another HCV isolate or genotype.</p><p>The present invention also has significant diagnostic implications. In one embodiment, the invention provides an in vitro method for detecting antibodies to HCV in a biological sample from a subject comprising contacting a biological sample from a subject with HCV virus particles of the invention, e.g., prepared as described above, under conditions that permit binding of HCV-specific antibodies in the sample to the HCV virus particles; and detecting binding of antibodies in the sample to the HCV virus particles, wherein detecting binding of antibodies in the sample to the HCV virus particles is indicative of the presence of antibodies to HCV in the sample.</p><p>An alternative in vitro method for detecting the presence of HCV in a biological sample from a subject comprises contacting a cell line permissive for productive HCV infection with a biological sample, wherein the cell line has been modified to contain a transgene that express a reporter gene product expressed under control of a trans-acting factor produced by HCV; and detecting expression of the reporter gene product, wherein detection of expression of the reporter gene product is indicative of the presence of HCV in the biological sample from the subject. In a related embodiment, the invention provides an in vitro method for detecting the presence of HCV in a biological sample from a subject comprising contacting a cell line permissive for productive HCV infection with a biological sample, wherein the cell line has been modified to contain a defective virus transgene, which defective virus transgene will express a reporter gene product at high levels under control of a trans-acting factor produced by HCV; and detecting expression of the reporter gene product, wherein detection of expression of the reporter gene product is indicative of the presence of HCV in the biological sample from the subject. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is in providing permissive (or susceptible) cell lines for these in vitro diagnostics. The method according to claim 64, wherein the defective viral transgene produces an engineered alphavirus, the trans-acting helper factor is alphavirus nsP4 polymerase, and wherein the alphavirus nsP4 polymerase is expressed as a chimeric fusion protein with HCV NS4A, such that the alphavirus nsP4 polymerase-HCV NS4A chimeric fusion protein is cleaved by HCV NS3 proteinase to release functional alphavirus nsP4 polymerase. In the foregoing methods, the biological sample is selected from the group consisting of blood, serum, plasma, blood cells, lymphocytes, and liver tissue biopsy.</p><p>In a related aspect, the invention also provides a test kit for HCV comprising authentic HCV virus components, and a diagnostic test kit for HCV comprising components derived from an authentic HCV virus.</p><p>Thus, a primary object of the present invention has been to provide a DNA encoding infectious HCV.</p><p>A related object of the invention is to provide infectious HCV genomic RNA from DNA clones.</p><p>Still another object of the invention is to provide attenuated HCV DNA or genomic RNA suitable for vaccine development, which can invade a cell but fails to propagate infectious virus.</p><p>Another object of the invention is to provide in vitro and in vivo models of HCV infection for testing anti-HCV (or antiviral) drugs, for evaluating drug resistance, and for testing attenuated HCV viral vaccines.</p><p>Still another object of the invention is to provide for expression of HCV virions or virus particle proteins that can be used to identify the HCV receptor, receptor binding antagonists, and in neutralization assays. In addition, expressed HCV virions or virus particle proteins can be used to develop more effective HCV vaccines, with antigens that are structurally identical to or closely related to native HCV.</p><p>A further object of the present invention is to provide HCV diagnostics based on the ability to detect infectious HCV using engineered reporter cells.</p><p>Yet another object is to provide authentic viral antigens, particularly viral particles, to assay for HCV-specific antibodies or generate HCV-specific antibodies.</p><p>These and other objects of the present invention will be elaborated by the drawings and the Detailed Description of the Invention.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 (PRIOR ART). HCV genome structure, polyprotein processing, and protein features. At the top is depicted the viral genome with the structural and nonstructural, protein coding regions, and the 5' and 3' NTRs, and the putative 3' secondary structure. Boxes below the genome indicate proteins generated by the proteolytic processing cascade. Putative structural proteins are indicated by shaded boxes and the nonstructural proteins by open boxes. Contiguous stretches of uncharged amino acids are shown by black bars. Asterisks denote proteins with N-linked glycans but do not necessarily indicate the position or number of sites utilized. Cleavage sites shown are for host signalase (.diamond-solid.), the NS2-3 proteinase (curved arrow), an the NS3-4A serine protease ().</p><p>FIG. 2 (A-G). Strategies for expression of heterologous RNAs and proteins using HCV vectors panels A-G of which are shown in Bredenbeek and Rice (Semin. Virol. 3:297-310, 1992). At the top is a diagram of the positive-polarity RNA virus HCV, which expresses mature viral proteins by translation of a single long ORF and proteolytic processing. The regions of the polyprotein encoding the structural proteins (STRUCTURAL) and the nonstructural proteins (REPLICASE) are indicated as lightly-shaded and open boxes, respectively. Below are shown a number of proposed replication-competent "replicon" expression constructs. The first four constructs (A-D) lack structural genes and would therefore require a helper system to enable packaging into infectious virions. Constructs E-G would not require helper functions for replication or packaging. Darkly shaded boxes indicate heterologous or foreign gene sequences (FG). Translation initiation (aug) and termination signals (trm) are indicated by open triangles and solid diamonds, respectively. Internal ribosomes entry sites (IRES) are shown as boxes with vertical stripes. Constructs A and H illustrate the expression of a heterologous product as an in-frame fusion with the HCV polyprotein. Such protein fusion junctions can be engineered such that processing is mediated either by host or viral proteinases (indicated by the arrow).</p><p>FIG. 3 (A and B). Engineered cell lines for assaying HCV infection. Panel A. Depicts a cells expressing the three silent transgenes. Driven by nuclear promoter elements are: (i) an mRNA expressing a polyprotein protein consisting of HCV NS4A fused to Sindbis virus (Sin) nonstructural protein 4 (nsP4), (ii) a defective Sindbis virus replicon lacking the nsP4 coding region but a subgenomic promoter (arrow) driving expression of a reporter gene (black box), (iii) a defective Sindbis virus RNA lacking the nsPS but containing a ubiquitin-nsP4 fusion gene under the control of the subgenomic RNA promoter. The Sindbis replicton and defective RNA contain all the signals necessary for Sindbis virus-specific RNA replication, transcription and packaging signals (stem loop structure), but are silent in the absence of active nsP4. Panel B. Upon productive infection of a susceptible cells by HCV, the virus is uncoated, translated and begins replication (step 1). This results in the production of active NS3 serine proteinase (step 2) which cleaves at the HCV NS4A-Sindbis nsP4 junction (step 3) to produce active nsP4. nsP4 assembles with the other three Sindbis nsPs to form an active Sindbis replication complex (step 4) which can replicate both Sindbis specific RNAs and lead to transcription from the Sindbis virus subgenomic promoters (step 5). Ub-nsP4 expressed from the subgenomic RNA of the defective RNA is cleaved to form a more active form of the nsP4 polymerase which further amplifies replication and transcription of the Sindbis-specific RNAs (step 6). This leads to high levels of reporter gene expression (step 7).</p><p>FIG. 4. Initial set of constructs tested in the chimpanzee model (chimpanzee experiment I).

Virol. 70:3363 (1996)]. No specific PCR band was detected in the absence of cDNA synthesis, indicating that the HCV-specific nucleic acid signal was due to RNA.

For the sample shown in lane 2, competitor RNA was added after lysis with RNAzol (no RNAse treatment). In lane 3, 10 μl serum without competitor RNA was predigested with RNase A prior to extraction with RNAzol as in lane 1. Lane 4 is a negative control for RT-PCR.

A functional HCV nucleic acid of the invention advantageously provides for infection of susceptible animals and cell lines. Despite arduous efforts, infectious HCV has not previously been successfully cloned, thus precluding systematic evaluation of the virus's mechanisms of replication, receptor binding and cell invasion, development of antiviral therapeutic agents using in vitro and in vivo assay systems, and development of sensitive in vitro diagnostic assay systems. In addition, the clones of the invention now enable expression of HCV particles and particle proteins under conditions that permit proper processing, and thus expression of proteins that bear the closest possible structural resemblance to native HCV. Such particles and proteins are preferred for anti-HCV vaccine development. In addition, by identifying the elements of the HCV genome that are necessary for infection, the present inventors advantageously harness the properties of HCV that lead to chronic liver infection for preparation of gene therapy vectors. Such vectors are particularly useful since they target the liver, which is a source of many proteins and thus a desirable organ for expression of a soluble factor to supplement a deficiency in a subject.</p><p>The present invention is based, in part, on generation of a functional genotype la cDNA clone, which can be used as a basis for preparation of functional clones for other HCV genotypes (e.g., constructed and verified using similar methods). These products have a variety of applications for development of (i) more effective HCV therapies; (ii) HCV vaccines; (iii) HCV diagnostics; and (iv) HCV-based gene expression vectors. Examples of these applications are described below.</p><p>The current invention describes the determination of an HCV consensus sequence and the use of this information to construct full-length HCV cDNA clones capable of yielding replication-competent infectious RNA transcripts. The rigorous determination of terminal sequences, including the discovery of highly conserved sequences at the 5' and 3' ends, the use of less error-prone methods for amplifying and assembling HCV cDNA clones, and the assembly of clones reflecting a consensus sequence, all contributed to the success of the present invention.</p><p>The term "authentic" is used herein to refer to an HCV nucleic acid, whether a DNA (i.e., cDNA) or RNA, that provides for full genomic replication and production of functional HCV proteins, or components thereof. In a specific embodiment, an authentic HCV nucleic acid is infectious, e.g., in a chimpanzee model or in tissue culture, forms viral particles (i.e., virions), or both. However, an authentic HCV nucleic acid of the invention may also be attenuated, such that it only produces some (not all) functional HCV proteins, or it can productively infect cells without replication in the absence of a helper cell line or plasmid, etc. The authentic HCV exemplified in the present application contains all of the virus-encoded information, whether in RNA elements or encoded proteins, necessary for initiation of an HCV replication cycle that corresponds to replication of wild-type virus in vivo. The specific HCV clones described herein, including the embodiment deposited with the ATCC and variants thereof described or exemplified in this application, represent a preferred starting material for developing HCV therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and expression vectors. In particular, use of the HCV nucleic acids of the invention assures that authentic HCV components are involved, since, unlike the cloned HCVs of the prior art, these components together provide an infectious protein. The specific starting materials described herein, and preferably the deposited plasmid clone harboring authentic HCV cDNA, can be modified as described herein, e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis, to produce a defective or attenuated derivative. Alternatively, sequences from other genotypes or isolates can be substituted for the homologous sequence of the specific embodiments described herein. For example, an authentic HCV nucleic acid of the invention may comprise the consensus 5' and 3' sequences disclosed herein, e.g., on a recipient plasmid, and a polyprotein coding region from another isolate or genotype (either a consensus region or one obtained by very high fidelity cloning) is substituted for the homologous polyprotein coding region of the HCV exemplified herein. In addition, the general characteristics for an authentic HCV as described herein, including but not limited to containing extreme 5' or 3' sequences, or both, containing an ORF that encodes a polyprotein whose cleavage products form functional components of HCV virus particles and RNA replication machinery, and, in a preferred embodiment, incorporate a consensus sequence of a specific isolate or genotype provide for obtaining authentic HCV clones.</p><p>In particular, the present invention provides for modifying or "correcting" non-functional HCV clones, e.g., that are incapable of genuine replication, that fail to produce HCV proteins, that do not produce HCV RNA as detected by Northern analysis, or that fail to infect susceptible animals or cell lines in vitro. By comparing an authentic HCV nucleic acid sequence of the invention, e.g., the cDNA sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, with the sequence of the non-functional HCV clone, defects in the non-functional clone can be identified and corrected. All of the methods for modifying nucleic acid sequences available to one of skill in the art to effect modifications in the non-functional HCV genome, including but not limited to site-directed mutagenesis, substitution of the functional sequence from an authentic HCV clone, e.g., of SEQ ID NO:1, for the homologous sequence in the non-functional clone, etc.</p><p>The term "consensus sequence" is used herein to refer to a functional HCV genomic sequence, or any portion thereof, including the 5'-NTR, polyprotein coding sequence or portion thereof, and 3'-NTR, which is determined by identifying the consensus residues from three or more, preferably six or more, independent clones of a strain or genotype of HCV. In the Examples, infra, 5'-NTR (including some capsid proteins from the polyprotein coding region) and 3'-NTR (including some portion of the genome encoding the C-terminus of the polyprotein) consensus sequences were determined and incorporated in a recipient plasmid (Example 3). Consensus sequences for the majority of the polyprotein coding region from a KpnI site to a NotI site were also determined, as shown in FIG. 8 and Example 4, infra, which yielded a consensus sequence. Insertion of the KpnI and NotI portion of the polyprotein coding sequence are inserted in the recipient plasmid containing consensus 5' and 3' consensus sequences, yields an authentic HCV genomic DNA clone.</p><p>The authentic HCV nucleic acid of the invention preferably includes a 5'-NTR extreme conserved sequence comprising the 5'-terminal sequence GCCAGCC, which may have additional bases upstream of this conserved sequence without affecting functional activity of the HCV nucleic acid. In a preferred embodiment, the 5'-GCCAGCC includes from 0 to about 10 additional upstream bases; more preferably it includes from 0 to about 5 upstream bases; more preferably still it includes 0, one, or two upstream bases. In specific embodiments, the extreme 5'-terminal sequence may be GCCAGCC; GGCCAGCC; UGCCAGCC; AGCCAGCC; AAGCCAGCC; GAGCCAGCC; GUGCCAGCC; or GCGCCAGCC, wherein the sequence GCCAGCC is the 5'-terminus of SEQ ID NO:3.</p><p>In an authentic HCV nucleic acid of the invention, the 3'-NTR comprises a long polypyrimidine region. In positive-strand HCV RNA, the region corresponds to a poly(U)/poly(UC) tract. Naturally, in positive-strand HCV DNA, this is a poly(T)/poly(TC) tract. The Examples, infra, show that the polypyrimidine tract may be of variable length: both short (about 75 bases) and long (133 bases) are effective, although an HCV clone containing a long poly(U/UC) tract is found to be highly infectious. Longer tracts may be found in naturally occurring HCV isolates. Thus, an authentic HCV nucleic acid of the invention may have a variable length polypyrimidine tract.</p><p>In a specific embodiment of the invention, plasmid p90/HCVFL [long poly(U)] harboring a cDNA encoding an infectious HCV RNA under control of a phage promoter was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., United States of America on Feb. 13, 1997 on behalf of Washington University School of Medicine for the purpose of compliance with the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Protection in accordance with its provisions, and the provisions of 37 C.F.R.  1.801 et seq.</p><p>The benefits of this technology are enormous and far reaching. Of immediate significance is use of HCV cDNA from these functional clones as starting material for studies on the functions of individual HCV proteins and RNA elements using biochemical, cell culture, and transgenic animal approaches. The use of functional cDNA will minimize the chances of obtaining negative or misleading results because of errors introduced during cDNA synthesis or PCR-amplification. Such clones will also provide defined starting material for future molecular genetic studies on many aspects of HCV biology in the context of authentic virus replication. Uses relevant to therapy and vaccine development include: (i) the generation of defined HCV virus stocks to develop in vitro and in vivo assays for virus neutralization, attachment, penetration and entry; (ii) structure/function studies on HCV proteins and RNA elements and identification of new antiviral targets; (iii) a systematic survey of cell culture systems and conditions to identify those that support HCV RNA replication and particle release; (iv) production of adapted HCV variants capable of more efficient replication in cell culture; (v) production of HCV variants with altered tissue or species tropism; (vi) establishment of alternative animal models for inhibitor evaluation including those supporting HCV replication; (vii) development of cell-free HCV replication assays; (viii) production of immunogenic HCV particles for vaccination; (ix) engineering of attenuated HCV derivatives as possible vaccine candidates; (x) engineering of attenuated or defective HCV derivatives for expression of heterologous gene products for gene therapy and vaccine applications; (xi) utilization of the HCV glycoproteins for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to the liver or other cell types with appropriate receptors.</p><p>Various terms are used herein, which have the following definitions:</p><p>The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such as gastric upset, dizziness and the like, when administered to a human. Preferably, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E. W. Martin.</p><p>The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" is used herein to mean an amount sufficient to reduce by at least about 15 percent, preferably by at least 50 percent, more preferably by at least 90 percent, and most preferably prevent, a clinically significant deficit in the activity, function and response of the host. Alternatively, a therapeutically effective amount is sufficient to cause an improvement in a clinically significant condition in the host.</p><p>The term "adjuvant" refers to a compound or mixture that enhances the immune response to an antigen. An adjuvant can serve as a tissue depot that slowly releases the antigen and also as a lymphoid system activator that non-specifically enhances the immune response (Hood et al., Immunology, Second Ed., 1984, Benjamin/Cummings: Menlo Park, Calif., p. 384). Often, a primary challenge with an antigen alone, in the absence of an adjuvant, will fail to elicit a humoral or cellular immune response. Adjuvants include, but are not limited to, complete Freund's adjuvant, incomplete Freund's adjuvant, saponin, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil or hydrocarbon emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium parvum. Preferably, the adjuvant is pharmaceutically acceptable.</p><p>In a specific embodiment, the term "about" or "approximately" means within 20%, preferably within 10%, and more preferably within 5% of a given value or range.</p><p>The following subsections of the application, which further amplify the foregoing disclosure, are provided for convenience and not by way of limitation.</p><heading>Functional Full-length Clones for Other HCV Isolates and Genotypes</heading><p>Using the approaches described here, functional full-length clones for the other HCV genotypes can be built and utilized for biological studies and antiviral screening and evaluation. In this extension of the invention, libraries can be constructed using RNA from single-exposure patients with high RNA titers (greater than 10.sup.6 /ml) and known clinical history. A consensus sequence for the isolate can be generated from the sequences of individual clones in the library. New recipient plasmids containing a promoter, 5' and 3' terminal consensus sequences (either determined for that isolate or from a different isolate e.g., HCV-H77), and a 3' restriction site for production of run-off transcripts can be constructed.</p><p>As less error-prone methods emerge, screening of a limited number of clones from combinatorial libraries may yield function clones. Alternatively, as described here, sequence of derived from multiple clones and directed assembly can be used to produce functional consensus clones.</p><p>Thus, the present invention contemplates isolation of other HCV genomic sequences, or consensus genomic sequences. In accordance with the present invention there may be employed conventional molecular biology, microbiology, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch &amp; Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (herein "Sambrook et al., 1989"); DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Volumes I and II (D. N. Glover ed. 1985); Oligonucleotide Synthesis (M. J. Gait ed. 1984); Nucleic Acid Hybridization [B. D. Hames &amp; S. J. Higgins eds. (1985)]; Transcription And Translation [B. D. Hames &amp; S. J. Higgins, eds. (1984)]; Animal Cell Culture [R. I. Freshney, ed. (1986)]; Immobilized Cells And Enzymes [IRL Press, (1986)]; B. Perbal, A Practical Guide To Molecular Cloning (1984); F. M. Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1994).</p><p>Therefore, if appearing herein, the following terms shall have the definitions set out below.</p><p>It should be appreciated that the terms HCV sequence, such as the "3' terminal sequence element," "3' terminus," "3' sequence element," are meant to encompass all of the following sequences: (i) an RNA sequence of the positive-sense genome RNA; (ii) the complement of this RNA sequence, i.e., the HCV negative-sense RNA; (iii) the DNA sequence corresponding to the positive-sense sequence of the RNA element; and (iv) the DNA sequence corresponding to the negative-sense sequence of the RNA element. Accordingly, nucleotide sequences displaying substantially equivalent or altered properties are likewise contemplated. These modifications may be deliberate, for example, such as modifications obtained through site-directed mutagenesis, or may be accidental, such as those obtained through mutations in hosts that are producers of the complex or its named subunits.</p><p>A "vector" is a replicon, such as a plasmid, phage, or cosmid, to which another DNA (or RNA) segment may be joined so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment. A "cassette" refers to a segment of DNA RNA that can be inserted into a vector at specific restriction sites. The segment of DNA or RNA encodes a polypeptide or RNA of interest, and the cassette and restriction sites are designed to ensure insertion of the cassette in the proper reading frame for transcription and translation.</p><p>Transcriptional and translational control sequences are DNA or RNA regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation signals, terminators, IRES elements, and the like, that provide for the expression of a coding sequence in a host cell. A coding sequence is "under the control of" or "operably (also operatively) associated with" transcriptional and translational control sequences in a cell when RNA polymerase transcribes the coding sequence into RNA. RNA sequences can also serve as expression control sequences by virtue of their ability to modulate translation, RNA stability, RNA replication, and RNA transcription (for RNA viruses).</p><p>A "promoter sequence" is a DNA or RNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3' direction) coding or noncoding sequence. Thus, promoter sequences can also be used to refer to analogous RNA sequences or structures of similar function in RNA virus replication and transcription. Preferred promoters for cell-free or bacterial expression of infections HCV DNA clones of the invention are the phage promoters T7, T3, and SP6. Alternatively, a nuclear promoter, such as cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, can be used. Indeed, depending on the system used, expression may be driven from a eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or viral promoter element. Promoters for expression of HCV RNA can provide for capped or uncapped transcripts.</p><p>As used herein, the term "homologous" in all its grammatical forms and spelling variations refers to the relationship between proteins that possess a "common evolutionary origin," including proteins from superfamilies (e.g., the immunoglobulin superfamily) and homologous proteins from different species (e.g., myosin light chain, etc.) [Reeck et al., Cell 50:667 (1987)]. Such proteins (and their encoding genes) have a high degree of sequence similarity. The term "sequence similarity" in all its grammatical forms refers to the degree of identity or correspondence between nucleic acid or amino acid sequences of proteins that may or may not share a common evolutionary origin [see Reeck et al., supra]. However, in common usage and in the instant application, the term "homologous," when modified with an adverb such as "substantially" or "highly," may refer to sequence similarity and not a common evolutionary origin.</p><p>In a specific embodiment, two DNA or RNA sequences are "homologous" or "substantially similar" when at least about 50% (preferably at least about 75%, and most preferably at least about 90 or 95%) of the nucleotides match over the defined length of the DNA sequences. Sequences that are substantially homologous can be identified by comparing the sequences using standard software available in sequence data banks, or in a Southern hybridization experiment under, for example, stringent conditions as defined for that particular system. Defining appropriate hybridization conditions is within the skill of the art. See, e.g., Maniatis et al., supra; DNA Cloning, Vols. I &amp; II, supra; Nucleic Acid Hybridization, supra.</p><p>Similarly, in a particular embodiment, two amino acid sequences are "homologous" or "substantially similar" when greater than 30% of the amino acids are identical, or greater than about 60% are similar (functionally identical). Preferably, the similar or homologous sequences are identified by alignment using, for example, the GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Program Manual for the GCG Package, Version 7, Madison, Wis.) pileup program.</p><p>The term "corresponding to" in relation to nucleic acid or amino acid structure is used herein to refer similar or homologous sequences, whether the exact position is identical or different from the molecule to which the similarity or homology is measured. A nucleic acid or amino acid sequence alignment may include gaps. Thus, the term "corresponding to" refers to the sequence similarity or regions of homology, and not the numbering of the amino acid residues or nucleotide bases.</p><p>HCV genomic nucleic acids can be isolated from any source of infectious HCV, particularly from tissue samples (blood, plasma, serum, liver biopsy, leukocytes, etc.) from an infected human or simian, or other permissive animal species. Methods for obtaining genomic HCV clones or portions thereof are well known in the art, as described above [see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra]. HCV isolates, including polyprotein coding region sequences, are described, for example, in International Patent Publication WO 89/04669, published Jun. 1, 1989 by Houghton et al.; International Patent Publication WO 90/11089, published Oct. 4, 1990 by Houghton et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,350,671, issued Sep. 27, 1994 to Houghton et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,928, issued Dec. 13, 1994 to Miyamura et al.; European Patent Application No. EP 0 521 318 A2, published Jan. 7, 1993 for Cho et al.; and European Patent Application No. EP 0 510 952 A1, published Oct. 28, 1992, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Representative genotypes further include, but are by no means restricted to, other 1a isolates, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, etc. [Bukh et al., (1995) supra; Simmonds, Hepatology 21: 570-83 (1995); Simmonds et al., Hepatology 19: 1321-1324 (1994); Simmonds et al., J. Gen. Virol. 77: 3013-3024 (19960]. For many subtypes and genotypes, enough sequence data are available to design primers for RT/PCR and PCR assembly.</p><p>In the molecular cloning genomic HCV RNA or DNA, DNA fragments are generated, e.g., by reverse transcription into cDNA and PCR. These fragments may be assembled to form a full length sequence. Preparation of many such fragments provides a combinatorial library of HCV clones. Such a library may yield an infectious clone; more likely, the consensus sequence should be determined by comparing the sequences of all or a significant number of clones from such a library. Enough clones should be evaluated so that a majority of bases at any divergent position are identical. Thus, a consensus may be determined by analyzing the sequence of at least three clones, preferably about five clones, and more preferably six or more clones. Naturally, the more error-prone the cloning method, the greater the number of clones that should be sequenced to yield an authentic HCV consensus sequence.</p><p>The consensus sequence can then be used to prepare an infectious HCV DNA clone. The fidelity of the resulting clones is preferably established by sequencing. However, selection can be carried out on the basis of the properties of the clone, e.g., if the clone encodes an infectious HCV RNA. Thus, successful preparation of an infectious HCV DNA clone may be detected by assays based on the physical, pathological, or immunological properties of an animal or cell culture transfected or infected with the clone. For example, cDNA clones can be selected that produce an HCV virion or virus particle protein that, e.g., has similar or identical physical-chemical, electrophoretic migration, isoelectric focusing, or non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis behavior, proteolytic digestion maps, or antigenic properties as known for native HCV or HCV virus particle proteins.</p><p>Components of functional HCV cDNA clones. Components of the functional HCV cDNA described in this invention can be used to develop cell-free, cell culture, chimeric virus, and animal-based screening assays for known or newly identified HCV antiviral targets as described infra. Examples of known or suspected targets and assays include [see Houghton, In "Fields Virology" (B. N. Fields, D. M. Knipe and P. M. Howley, Eds.), Vol. pp. 1035-1058. Raven Press, New York (1996); Rice, (1996) supra; Rice et al., Antiviral Therapy 1, Suppl. 4, 11-17 (1997); Shimotohno, Hepatology 21,:887-8 (1995) for reviews], but are not limited to, the following:</p><p>The highly conserved 5' NTR, which contains elements essential for translation of the incoming HCV genome RNA, is one target. It is also likely that this sequence, or its complement, contains RNA elements important for RNA replication and/or packaging. Potential therapeutic strategies include: antisense oligonucleotides (supra); trans-acting ribozymes (supra); RNA decoys; small molecule compounds interfering with the function of this element (these could act by binding to the RNA element itself or to cognate viral or cellular factors required for activity).</p><p>Another target is the HCV C (capsid or core) protein which is highly conserved and is associated with the following functions: RNA binding and specific encapsidation of HCV genome RNA; transcriptional modulation of cellular [Ray et al., Virus Res. 37: 209-220 (1995)] and other viral [Shih et al., J. Virol. 69: 1160-1171 (1995); Shih et al., J. Virol. 67: 5823-5832 (1993)] genes; cellular transformation [Ray et al., J. Virol. 70: 4438-4443 (1996a)]; prevention of apoptosis [Ray et al., Virol. 226: 176-182 (1996b)]; modulation of host immune response through binding to members of the TNF receptor superfamily [Matsumoto et al., J. Virol. 71: 1301-1309 (1997)].</p><p>The E1, E2, and E2-p7 glycoproteins which form the components of the virion envelope and are targets for potentially neutralizing antibodies. Key steps for intervention include: signal peptidase mediated cleavage of these precursors from the polyprotein [Lin et al., (1994a ) supra]; ER assembly of the E1E2 glycoprotein complex and association of these proteins with cellular chaperones and folding machinery [Dubuisson et al., (1994) supra; Dubuisson and Rice, J. Virol. 70: 778-786 (1996)]; assembly of virus particles including interactions between the nucleocapsid and virion envelope; transport and release of virus particles; the association of virus particles with host components such as VLDL [Hijikata et al., (1993) supra; Thomssen et al., (1992) supra; Thomssen et al., Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 182: 329-334 (1993)] which may play a role in evasion of immune surveillance or in binding and entry of cells expressing the LDL receptor; conserved and variable determinants in the virion which are targets for neutralization by antibodies or which bind to antibodies and facilitate immune-enhanced infection of cells via interaction with cognate Fc receptors; conserved and variable determinants in the virion important for receptor binding and entry; virion determinants participating in entry, fusion with cellular membranes, and uncoating the incoming viral nucleocapsid.</p><p>The NS2-3 autoprotease, which is required for cleavage at the 2/3 site is a further target.</p><p>The NS3 serine protease and NS4A cofactor which form a complex and mediate four cleavages in the HCV polyprotein [see Rice, (1997) supra for review) is yet another suitable target. Targets include the serine protease activity itself; the tetrahedral Zn.sup.2+  coordination site in the C-terminal domain of the serine protease; the NS3-NS4A cofactor interaction; the membrane association of NS4A; stabilization of NS3 by NS4A; transforming potential of the NS3 protease region [Sakamuro et al., J. Virol 69: 3893-6 (1995)].</p><p>The NS3 RNA-stimulated NTPase [Suzich et al., (1993) supra], RNA helicase [Jin and Peterson, Arch Biochem Biophys 323: 47-53 (1995); Kim et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 215: 160-6 (1995)], and RNA binding [Kanai et al., FEBS Lett 376: 221-4 (1995)] activities; the NS4A protein as a component of the RNA replication complex of as yet undefined function; the NS5A protein, another presumed replication component, is phosphorylated predominantly on serine residues [Tanji et al., J. Virol. 69: 3980-3986 (1995)] are all targets for drug development. Possible characteristics of the latter which could be targets for therapy include the kinase responsible for NS5A phosphorylation and its interaction with NS5A; the interaction with NS5A and other components of the HCV replication complex.</p><p>The NS5B RDRP, which is the enzyme responsible for the actual synthesis of HCV positive and negative-strand RNAs, is another target. Specific aspects of its activity include the polymerase activity itself [Behrens et al., EMBO J. 15: 12-22 (1996)]; interactions of NS5B with other replicase components, including the HCV RNAs; steps involved in the initiation of negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis; phosphorylation of NS5B [Hwang et al., Virology 227:438 (1997)].</p><p>Other targets include structural or nonstructural protein functions important for HCV RNA replication and/or modulation of host cell function. Possible hydrophobic protein components capable of forming channels important for viral entry, egress or modulation of host cell gene expression may be targeted.</p><p>The 3' NTR, especially the highly conserved elements (poly (U/UC) tract; 98-base terminal sequence) can be targeted. Therapeutic approaches parallel those described for the 5 NTR, except that this portion of the genome is likely to play a key role in the initiation of negative-strand synthesis. It may also be involved in other aspects of HCV RNA replication, including translation, RNA stability, or packaging.</p><p>The functional HCV cDNA clones encode all of the viral proteins and RNA elements required for RNA packaging. These elements can be targeted for development of antiviral compounds. Electrophoretic mobility shift, UV cross-linking, filter binding, and three-hybrid [SenGupta et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 8496-8501 (1996)] assays can be used to define the protein and RNA elements important for HCV RNA packaging and to establish assays to screen for inhibitors of this process. Such inhibitors might include small molecules or RNA decoys produced by selection in vitro [Gold et al., (1995) supra].</p><p>Complex HCV libraries can be prepared using PCR sherffling, or by incorporating randomized sequences, such as are generated in "peptide display" libraries. Using the "phage method" [Scott and Smith, 1990, Science 249:386-390 (1990); Cwirla, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87:6378-6382 (1990); Devlin et al., Science, 249:404406 (1990)], very large libraries can be constructed (10.sup.6 -10.sup.8 chemical entities). As noted above, and exemplified infra, clones from such libraries can be used to generate a consensus genomic sequence.</p><p>Due to the degeneracy of nucleotide coding sequences, other DNA sequences that encode substantially the same amino acid sequence as an HCV polyprotein coding region may be used in the practice of the present invention. These include but are not limited to homologous genes from other species, and nucleotide sequences comprising all or portions of HCV polyprotein genes altered by the substitution of different codons that encode the same amino acid residue within the sequence, thus producing a silent change. Such silent changes permit creation of genomic markers, which can be used to identify a particular infectious isolate in a multiple infection animal model. Likewise, the HCV genomic derivatives of the invention include, but are not limited to, those containing, as a primary amino acid sequence, all or part of the amino acid sequence of an HCV polyprotein including altered sequences in which functionally equivalent amino acid residues are substituted for residues within the sequence resulting in a conservative amino acid substitution. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence can be substituted by another amino acid of a similar polarity, which acts as a functional equivalent, resulting in a silent alteration. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence may be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. Amino acids containing aromatic ring structures are phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid.</p><p>Particularly preferred substitutions are:</p><p>Lys for Arg and vice versa such that a positive charge may be maintained;</p><p>Glu for Asp and vice versa such that a negative charge may be maintained;</p><p>Ser for Thr such that a free --OH can be maintained; and</p><p>Gln for Asn such that a free NH.sub.2 can be maintained.</p><p>In another embodiment, an authentic HCV clone can be modified to introduce amino acid substitutions that reduce or eliminate protein function. An authentic HCV clone can also be modified to introduce amino acid substitutions that alter viral tropism.</p><p>Moreover, since HCV lacks proofreading activity, the virus itself readily mutates, forming mutant "quasi-species" of HCV that are also contemplated as within the present invention. Such mutations are easily identified by sequencing isolates from a subject, as detailed herein.</p><p>The clones encoding HCV derivatives and analogs of the invention can be produced by various methods known in the art. The manipulations which result in their production can occur at the gene or protein level. For example, the cloned HCV genome sequence can be modified by any of numerous strategies known in the art [Sambrook et al., 1989, supra]. The genomic sequence can be cleaved at appropriate sites with restriction endonuclease(s), followed by further enzymatic modification if desired, isolated, and ligated in vitro. Alternatively, genomic fragments can be joined, e.g., with PCR, to create an HCV genome. In the production of the genomic nucleic acid derivative or analog of HCV, care should be taken to ensure that the modified genome remains within the same translational reading frame as the native HCV genome, uninterrupted by translational stop signals, in the region where the desired activity is encoded.</p><p>The HCV polyprotein-encoding nucleic acid sequence can be mutated in vitro or in vivo, to create and/or destroy translation, initiation, and/or termination sequences, or to create variations in coding regions and/or form new restriction endonuclease sites or destroy preexisting ones, to facilitate further in vitro modification. Preferably, such mutations provide for modification of the functional activity of the HCV, e.g., to attenuate viral activity, or create a defective virus, as set forth infra. Any technique for mutagenesis known in the art can be used, including but not limited to, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis [Hutchinson, C., et al., 1978, J. Biol. Chem. 253:6551; Zoller and Smith, 1984, DNA 3:479488; Oliphant et al., 1986, Gene 44:177; Hutchinson et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83:710], use of TAB techniques are preferred for site directed mutagenesis [see Higuchi, 1989, "Using PCR to Engineer DNA", in PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification, H. Erlich, ed., Stockton Press, Chapter 6, pp. 61-70].</p><p>Adaptation of HCV for more efficient replication in cell culture or alternative hosts. As mentioned earlier, HCV replication in cell culture is inefficient. The engineering of dominant selectable makers under the control of the HCV replication machinery can also be used to select for adaptive mutations in the HCV replication machinery. Such adaptive mutations could be manifested, but are not restricted to: (i) altering the tropism of HCV RNA replication; (ii) altering viral products responsible for deleterious effects on host cells; (iii) increasing or decreasing HCV RNA replication efficiency; (iv) increasing or decreasing HCV RNA packaging efficiency and/or assembly and release of HCV particles; (v) altering cell tropism at the level of receptor binding and entry. Even if the sequence of an HCV original cDNA clone is incompatible with establishing replication in a particular cell type, mutations occurring during in vitro transcription, during the initial stages of HCV-mediated RNA synthesis, or incorporated in the template DNA by a variety of chemical or biological methods, supra, may allow replication in a particular cellular environment or animal host. The engineered dominant selectable marker, whose expression is dependent upon productive HCV RNA replication, can be used to select for adaptive mutations in either the HCV replication machinery or the transfected host cell, or both.</p><p>Chimeric HCV clones. Components of these functional clones can also be used to construct chimeric viruses for assay of HCV gene functions and inhibitors thereof [Filocamo et al., J. Virol. 71: 1417-1427 (1997); Hahm et al., Virology 226: 318-326 (1996); Lu and Wimmer, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 93: 1412-7 (1996)]. In one such extension of the invention, functional HCV elements such as the 5' IRES, proteases, RNA helicase, polymerase, or 3' NTR are used to create chimeric derivatives of BVDV whose productive replication is dependent on one or more of these HCV elements. Such BVDV/HCV chimeras can then be used to screen for and evaluate antiviral strategies against these functional components.</p><p>In addition, dominant selectable markers can be used to select for mutations in the HCV replication machinery that allow higher levels of RNA replication or particle formation. In one example, engineered HCV derivatives expressing a mutant form of DHFR can be used to confer resistance to methotrexate (MTX). As a dominant selectable marker, mutant DHFR is inefficient since nearly stoichiometric amounts are required for MTX resistance. By successively increasing concentrations of MTX in the medium, increased quantities of DHFR will be required for continued survival of cells harboring the replicating HCV RNA. This selection scheme, or similar ones based on this concept, can result in the selection of mutations in the HCV RNA replication machinery allowing higher levels of HCV RNA replication and RNA accumulation. Similar selections can be applied for mutations allowing production of higher yields of HCV particles in cell culture or for mutant HCV particles with altered cell tropism. Such selection schemes involve harvesting HCV particles from culture supernatants or after cell disruption and selecting for MTX-resistant transducing particles by reinfection of naive cells.</p><p>The identified and isolated genomic RNA can be reverse transcribed into its cDNA. cDNA could also be made by "long" PCR to include the promoter and run-off site, or by using 3'-terminal consensus sequence-specific primers for insertion in an appropriate recipient vector. Any of these cDNAs may be inserted into an appropriate cloning vector, e.g., which comprises consensus 5'- and 3'-NTRs, along with a suitable promoter and 3'-runoff sequence. A clone that includes a primer and run-off sequence can be used directly for production of functional HCV RNA. A large number of vector-host systems known in the art may be used. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, E. coli, bacteriophages such as lambda derivatives, or plasmids such as pBR322 derivatives or pUC plasmid derivatives, e.g., pGEX vectors, pmal-c, pFLAG, pTET, etc. The insertion into a cloning vector can, for example, be accomplished by ligating the DNA fragment into a cloning vector which has complementary cohesive termini. However, if the complementary restriction sites used to fragment the DNA are not present in the cloning vector, the ends of the DNA molecules may be enzymatically modified. Alternatively, any site desired may be produced by ligating nucleotide sequences (linkers) onto the DNA termini; these ligated linkers may comprise specific chemically synthesized oligonucleotides encoding restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. Recombinant molecules can be introduced into host cells via transformation, transfection, infection, electroporation, etc., so that many copies of the gene sequence are generated.</p><heading>Expression of HCV RNA and Polypeptides</heading><p>The HCV DNA, which codes for HCV RNA and HCV proteins, particularly HCV RNA replicase or virion proteins, can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector, i.e., a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein-coding sequence. Such elements are termed herein a "promoter." Thus, the HCV DNA of the invention is operationally (or operably) associated with a promoter in an expression vector of the invention. An expression vector also preferably includes a replication origin. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals can be provided on a recombinant expression vector. In a preferred embodiment for in vitro synthesis of functional RNAs, the T7, T3, or SP6 promoter is used.</p><p>Potential host-vector systems include but are not limited to mammalian cell systems infected with virus recombinant (e.g., vaccinia virus, adenovirus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with recombinant viruses (e.g., baculovirus); microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors; plant cells; or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, DNA, plasmid DNA, or cosmid DNA. The expression elements of vectors vary in their strengths and specificities. Depending on the host-vector system utilized, any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements may be used.</p><p>The cell into which the recombinant vector comprising the HCV DNA clone has been introduced is cultured in an appropriate cell culture medium under conditions that provide for expression of HCV RNA or such HCV proteins by the cell. Any of the methods previously described for the insertion of DNA fragments into a cloning vector may be used to construct expression vectors containing a gene consisting of appropriate transcriptional/translational control signals and the protein coding sequences. These methods may include in vitro recombinant DNA and synthetic techniques and in vivo recombination (genetic recombination).</p><p>Expression of HCV RNA or protein may be controlled by any promoter/enhancer element known in the art, but these regulatory elements must be functional in the host selected for expression. Promoters which may be used to control expression include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early promoter region (Benoist and Chambon, 1981, Nature 290:304-310), the promoter contained in the 3' long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto,. et al., 1980, Cell 22:787-797), the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:1441-1445), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster et al., 1982, Nature 296:39-42); prokaryotic expression vectors such as the β-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff, et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75:3727-3731), or the tac promoter (DeBoer, et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:21-25); see also "Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria" in Scientific American, 1980, 242:74-94; promoter elements from yeast or other fungi such as the Gal 4 promoter, the ADC (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter, PGK (phosphoglycerol kinase) promoter, alkaline phosphatase promoter; and the animal transcriptional control regions, which exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized in transgenic animals: elastase I gene control region which is active in pancreatic acinar cells (Swift et al., 1984, Cell 38:639-646; Ornitz et al., 1986, Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 50:399-409; MacDonald, 1987, Hepatology 7:425-515); insulin gene control region which is active in pancreatic beta cells (Hanahan, 1985, Nature 315:115-122), immunoglobulin gene control region which is active in lymphoid cells (Grosschedl et al., 1984, Cell 38:647-658; Adames et al., 1985, Nature 318:533-538; Alexander et al., 1987, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:1436-1444), mouse mammary tumor virus control region which is active in testicular, breast, lymphoid and mast cells (Leder et al., 1986, Cell 45:485-495), albumin gene control region which is active in liver (Pinkert et al., 1987, Genes and Devel. 1:268-276), alpha-fetoprotein gene control region which is active in liver (Krumlauf et al., 1985, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:1639-1648; Hammer et al., 1987, Science 235:53-58), alpha 1-antitrypsin gene control region which is active in the liver (Kelsey et al., 1987, Genes and Devel. 1: 161-171), beta-globin gene control region which is active in myeloid cells (Mogram et al., 1985, Nature 315:338-340; Kollias et al., 1986, Cell 46:89-94), myelin basic protein gene control region which is active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain (Readhead et al., 1987, Cell 48:703-712), myosin light chain-2 gene control region which is active in skeletal muscle (Sani, 1985, Nature 314:283-286), and gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control region which is active in the hypothalamus (Mason et al., 1986, Science 234:1372-1378).</p><p>A wide variety of host/expression vector combinations may be employed in expressing the DNA sequences of this invention. Useful expression vectors, for example, may consist of segments of chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences. Suitable vectors include derivatives of SV40 and known bacterial plasmids, e.g., E. coli plasmids col E1, pCR1, pBR322, pMal-C2, pET, pGEX [Smith et al., 1988, Gene 67:31-40], pMB9 and their derivatives, plasmids such as RP4; phage DNAS, e.g., the numerous derivatives of phage λ, e.g., NM989, and other phage DNA, e.g., M13 and filamentous single stranded phage DNA; yeast plasmids such as the 2μ plasmid or derivatives thereof; vectors useful in eukaryotic cells, such as vectors useful in insect or mammalian cells; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNAs, such as plasmids that have been modified to employ phage DNA or other expression control sequences; and the like known in the art.</p><p>In addition to the preferred sequencing analysis, expression vectors containing an HCV DNA clone of the invention can be identified by four general approaches: (a) PCR amplification of the desired plasmid DNA or specific mRNA, (b) nucleic acid hybridization, (c) presence or absence of selection marker gene functions, (d) analysis with appropriate restriction endonucleases and (e) expression of inserted sequences. In the first approach, the nucleic acids can be amplified by PCR to provide for detection of the amplified product. In the second approach, the presence of a foreign gene inserted in an expression vector can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization using probes comprising sequences that are homologous to the HCV DNA. In the third approach, the recombinant vector/host system can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain "selection marker" gene functions (e.g., β-galactosidase activity, thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, transformation phenotype, occlusion body formation in baculovirus, etc.) caused by the insertion of foreign genes in the vector. In the fourth approach, recombinant expression vectors are identical by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes. In the fifth approach, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying for the activity, biochemical, or immunological characteristics of the gene product expressed by the recombinant, e.g., HCV RNA, HCV virions, or HCV viral proteins.</p><p>For example, in a baculovirus expression systems, both non-fusion transfer vectors, such as but not limited to pVL941 (BamHI cloning site; Summers), pVL1393 (BamHI, SmaI, XbaI, EcoRI, NotI, XmaIII, BglII, and PstI cloning site; Invitrogen), pVL1392 (BglII, PstI, NotI, XmaIII, EcoRI, XbaI, SmaI, and BamHI cloning site; Summers and Invitrogen), and pBlueBacIII (BamHI, BglII, PstI, NcoI, and HindIII cloning site, with blue/white recombinant screening possible; Invitrogen), and fusion transfer vectors, such as but not limited to pAc700 (BamHI and KpnI cloning site, in which the BamHI recognition site begins with the initiation codon; Summers), pAc701 and pAc702 (same as pAc700, with different reading frames), pAc360 (BamHI cloning site 36 base pairs downstream of a polyhedrin initiation codon; Invitrogen(195)), and pBlueBacHisA, B, C (three different reading frames, with BamHI, BglII, PstI, NcoI, and HindII cloning site, an N-terminal peptide for ProBond purification, and blue/white recombinant screening of plaques; Invitrogen) can be used.</p><p>Examples of mammalian expression vectors contemplated for use in the invention include vectors with inducible promoters, such as the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoter, e.g., any expression vector with a DHFR expression vector, or a DHFR/methotrexate co-amplification vector, such as pED (PstI, SalI, SbaI, SmaI, and EcoRI cloning site, with the vector expressing both the cloned gene and DHFR; [see Kaufman, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 16.12 (1991)]. Alternatively, a glutamine synthetase/methionine sulfoximine co-amplification vector, such as pEE14 (HindIII, XbaI, SmaI, SbaI, EcoRI, and BclI cloning site, in which the vector expresses glutamine synthase and the cloned gene; Celltech). In another embodiment, a vector that directs episomal expression under control of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) can be used, such as pREP4 (BamHI, SfiI, XhoI, NotI, NheI, HindIII, NheI, PvuII, and KpnI cloning site, constitutive RSV-LTR promoter, hygromycin selectable marker; Invitrogen), pCEP4 (BamHI, SfiI, XhoI, NotI, NheI, HindIII, NheI, PvuII, and KpnI cloning site, constitutive hCMV immediate early gene, hygromycin selectable marker; Invitrogen), pMEP4 (KpnI, PvuI, NheI, HindIII, NotI, XhoI, SfiI, BamHI cloning site, inducible methallothionein IIa gene promoter, hygromycin selectable marker: Invitrogen), pREP8 (BamHI, XhoI, NotI, HindIII, NheI, and KpnI cloning site, RSV-LTR promoter, histidinol selectable marker; Invitrogen), pREP9 (KpnI, NheI, HindIII, NotI, XhoI, SfiI, and BamHI cloning site, RSV-LTR promoter, G418 selectable marker; Invitrogen), and pEBVHis (RSV-LTR promoter, hygromycin selectable marker, N-terminal peptide purifiable via ProBond resin and cleaved by enterokinase; Invitrogen). Regulatable mammalian expression vectors, can be used, such as Tet and rTet [Gossen and Bujard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5547-51 (1992); Gossen et al., Science 268:1766-1769 (1995)]. Selectable mammalian expression vectors for use in the invention include pRc/CMV (HindIII, BstXI, NotI, SbaI, and ApaI cloning site, G418 selection; Invitrogen), pRc/RSV (HindIII, SpeI, BstXI, NotI, XbaI cloning site, G418 selection; Invitrogen), and others. Vaccinia virus mammalian expression vectors [see, Kaufman (1991) supra] for use according to the invention include but are not limited to pSC.sub.11 (SmaI cloning site, TK- and β-gal selection), pMJ601 (SalI, SmaI, AflI, NarI, BspMII, BamHI, ApaI, NheI, SacII, KpnI, and HindIII cloning site; TK- and β-gal selection), and pTKgptF1S (EcoRI, PstI, SalI, AccI, HindII, SbaI, BamHI, and Hpa cloning site, TK or XPRT selection).</p><p>Examples of yeast expression systems include the non-fusion pYES2 vector (XbaI, SphI, ShoI, NotI, GstXI, EcoRI, BstXI, BamHI, SacI, KpnI, and HindIII cloning sit; Invitrogen) or the fusion pYESHisA, B, C (XbaI, SphI, ShoI, NotI, BstXI, EcoRI, BamHI, SacI, KpnI, and HindIII cloning site, N-terminal peptide purified with ProBond resin and cleaved with enterokinase; Invitrogen), to mention just two, can be employed according to the invention.</p><p>In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post-translational processing and modification (e.g., glycosylation, cleavage [e.g., of signal sequence]) of proteins. Expression in yeast can produce a glycosylated product. Expression in eukaryotic cells can increase the likelihood of "native" glycosylation and folding of an HCV protein. Moreover, expression in mammalian cells can provide a tool for reconstituting, or constituting, native HCV virions or virus particle proteins.</p><p>Furthermore, different vector/host expression systems may affect processing reactions, such as proteolytic cleavages, to a different extent.</p><p>A variety of transfection methods, useful for other RNA virus studies, are enabled herein. Examples include microinjection, cell fusion, calcium-phosphatecationic liposomes such as lipofectin [Rice et al., New Biol. 1:285-296 (1989); see "HCV-based Gene Expression Vectors", infra], DE-dextran [Rice et al., J. Virol. 61: 3809-3819 (1987)], and electroporation [Bredenbeek et al., J. Virol 67: 6439-6446 (1993); Liljestrom et al., J. Virol. 65: 4107-4113 (1991)]. Scrape loading [Kumar et al., Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 32: 1059-1066 (1994)] and ballistic methods [Burkholder et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 165: 149-156 (1993)] may also be considered for cell types refractory to transfection by these other methods. A DNA vector transporter may be considered [see, e.g., Wu et al., 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267:963-967; Wu and Wu, 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263:14621-14624; Hartmut et al., Canadian Patent Application No. 2,012,311, filed Mar. 15, 1990].</p><heading>In Vitro Infection With HCV</heading><p>Identification of cell lines supporting HCV replication. An important aspect of the invention is a method it provides for developing new and more effective anti-H CV therapy by conferring the ability to evaluate the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies using an authentic and standardized in vitro HCV replication system. Such assays are invaluable before moving on to trials using rare and valuable experimental animals, such as the chimpanzee, or HCV-infected human patients. As mentioned in the Background of the Invention, at best only trace levels of HCV replication have been observed in cell culture and most of the systems reported are not amenable for drug screening or evaluation. The most promising system reported to date is the HTLV1-infected MT-2C T-lymphocyte subline, which has been shown to support HCV replication with a signal:noise ratio of about 1000: 1 [Mizutani et al., J. Virol., 70: 7219-23 (1996)]. It should be noted, however, that replication in this system is initiated by infection with a patient inoculum. Such a system may have utility, but will be limited by differences between inocula which affect cell tropism and the detection of replication.</p><p>The HCV infectious clone technology can be used to establish in vitro and in vivo systems for analysis of HCV replication and packaging. These include, but are not restricted to, (i) identification or selection of permissive cell types (for RNA replication, virion assembly and release); (ii) investigation of cell culture parameters (e.g., varying culture conditions, cell activation, etc.) or selection of adaptive mutations that increase the efficiency of HCV replication in cell cultures; and (iii) definition of conditions for efficient production of infectious HCV particles (either released into the culture supernatant or obtained after cell disruption). These and other readily apparent extensions of the invention have broad utility for HCV therapeutic, vaccine, and diagnostic development.</p><p>General approaches for identifying permissive cell types are outlined below. Optimal methods for RNA transfection (see also, supra) vary with cell type and are determined using RNA reporter constructs. These include, for example, bicistronic RNAs [Wang et al., J. Virol. 67: 3338-44 (1993)] with the structure 5'-CAT-HCV IRES-LUC-3' which are used both to optimize transfection conditions (CAT; chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity) and to determine if the cell type is permissive for HCV IRES-mediated translation (LUC; luciferase activity). For actual HCV RNA transfection experiments, cotransfection with a 5' capped luciferase reporter RNA [Wang et al., (1993) supra] provides an internal standard for productive transfection and translation. Examples of cell types potentially permissive for HCV replication include, but are not restricted to, primary human cells (e.g., hepatocytes, T-cells, B-cells, foreskin fibroblasts) as well as continuous human cell lines (e.g., HepG2, Huh7, HUT78, HPB-Ma, MT-2, MT-2C, and other HTLV-1 and HTLV-II infected T-cell lines, Namalawa, Daudi, EBV-transformed LCLs). In addition, cell lines of other species, especially those which are readily transfected with RNA and permissive for replication of flaviviruses or pestiviruses (e.g., SW-13, Vero, BHK-21, COS, PK-15, MBCK, etc.), can be tested. Cells are transfected using a method as described supra.</p><p>For replication assays, RNA transcripts are prepared using the functional clone and the corresponding non-functional, e.g., ΔGDD (see Examples) derivative, is used as a negative control for persistence of HCV RNA and antigen in the absence of productive replication. Template DNA (which complicates later analyses) is removed by repeated cycles of DNaseI treatment and acid phenol extraction followed by purification by either gel electrophoresis or gel filtration (less than one molecule of amplifiable DNA per 10.sup.9 molecules of transcript RNA). DNA-free RNA transcripts will be mixed with LUC reporter RNA and used to transfect cell cultures using optimal conditions determined above. After recovery of the cells, RNaseA is added to the media to digest excess input RNA and the cultures incubated for various periods of time. An early timepoint (˜1 day post-transfection) will be harvested and analyzed for LUC activity (to verify productive transfection) and positive-strand RNA levels in the cells and supernatant (as a baseline). Samples are collected periodically for 2-3 weeks and assayed for positive-strand RNA levels by QC-RT/PCR [see Kolykhalov et al., (1996) supra]. Cell types showing a clear and reproducible difference between the intact infectious transcript and the non-functional derivative, e.g., ΔGDD deletion, control can be subjected to more thorough analyses to verify authentic replication. Such assays include measurement of negative-sense HCV RNA accumulation by QC-RT/PCR [Gunji et al., (1994) supra; Lanford et al., Virology 202: 606-14 (1994)], Northern-blot hybridization, or metabolic labeling [Yoo et al., (1995) supra] and single cell methods, such as in situ hybridization [ISH; Gowans et al., In "Nucleic Acid Probes" (R. H. Symons, Eds.), Vol. pp. 139-158. CRC Press, Boca Raton. (1989)], in situ PCR [followed by ISH to detect only HCV-specific amplification products; Haase et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 4971-4975 (1990)], and immunohistochemistry.</p><p>HCV particles for studying virus-receptor interactions. In combination with the identification of cell lines which are permissive for HCV infection and replication, defined HCV stocks produced using the infectious clone technology can be used to evaluate the interaction of the HCV with cellular receptors. Assays can be set up which measure binding of the virus to susceptible cells or productive infection, and then used to screen for inhibitors of these processes.</p><p>Identification of cell lines for characterization of HCV receptors. Cell lines permissive for HCV RNA replication, as assayed by RNA transfection, can be screened for their ability to be infected by the virus. Cell lines permissive for RNA replication but which cannot be infected by the homologous virus may lack one or more host receptors required for HCV binding and entry. Such cells provide valuable tools for (i) functional identification and molecular cloning of HCV receptors and co-receptors; (ii) characterization of virus-receptor interactions; and (iii) developing assays to screen for compounds or biologics (e.g., antibodies, SELEX RNAs [Bartel and Szostak, In "RNA-protein interactions" (K. Nagai and I. W. Mattaj, Eds.), Vol. pp. 82-102. IRL Press, Oxford (1995); Gold et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem. 64: 763-797 (1995)], etc.) that inhibit these interactions.</p><p>Once defined in this manner, these HCV receptors serve not only as therapeutic targets but may also be expressed in transgenic animals rendering them susceptible to HCV infection [Koike et al., Dev Biol Stand 78: 101-7 (1993); Ren and Racaniello, J. Virol 66: 296-304 (1992)]. Such transgenic animal models supporting HCV replication and spread have important applications for evaluating anti-HCV drugs.</p><p>The ability to manipulate the HCV glycoprotein structure using infectious clone technology, or by genetic manipulations as described supra, may also be used to create HCV variants with altered receptor specificity. In one example, HCV glycoproteins can be modified to express a heterologous binding domain for a known cell surface receptor. The approach should allow the engineering of HCV derivatives with altered tropism and perhaps extend infection to non-chimeric small animal models.</p><p>Alternative approaches for identifying permissive cell lines. Besides using the unmodified HCV RNA transcripts derived from functional clones, these functional HCV clones can be engineered to provide selectable markers for HCV replication. For instance, genes encoding dominant selectable markers can be expressed as part of the HCV polyprotein, or as separate cistrons located in permissive regions of the HCV RNA genome. Such engineered derivatives [see Bredenbeek and Rice, Semin. Virol. 3: 297-310 (1992) for review] have been successfully constructed for other RNA viruses such as Sindbis virus [Frolov et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93: 11371-11377 (1996)] or the flavivirus Kunjin [Khromykh and Westaway, J. Virol. 71: 1497-1505 (1997)]. Examples of selectable markers for mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, the genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; methotrexate resistance), thymidine kinase (tk; methotrexate resistance), puromycin acetyl transferase (pac; puromycin resistance), neomycin resistance (neo; resistance to neomycin or G418), mycophenolic acid resistance (gpt), hygromycin resistance, and resistance to zeocin. Other selectable markers can be used in different hosts such as yeast (ura3, his3, leu2, trp1). Strategies for functional expression of heterologous genes have been described [see Bredenbeek and Rice, (1992) supra for review]. Examples include (FIG. 2): (i) in-frame insertion into the viral polyprotein with cleavage(s) to produce the selectable marker protein mediated by cellular or viral proteases; (ii) creation of separate cistrons using engineered translational start and stop signals. Examples include, but are not restricted to, the use of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA elements derived from cellular or viral mRNAs [Jang et al., Enzyme 44: 292-309 (1991); Macejak and Sarnow, Nature 353: 90-94 1991); Molla et al., Nature 356: 255-257 (1992)]. In a particular manifestation, a cassette including the EMCV IRES element and the neomycin resistance gene is inserted in the HCV H77 3' NTR hypervariable region. Transcribed RNAs are used to transfect human hepatocyte or other cell lines and the antibiotic G418 used for selecting resistant cell populations. In one manifestation of this approach, transcripts from pHCVFL/3'EMCVIRESneo (infra) are used to transfect a variety of different cell lines.</p><p>Alterations of the HCV cDNA can be made to produce lines expressing convenient assayable markers as indirect indicators of HCV replication. Such self-replicating RNAs might include the entire HCV genome RNA or RNA replicons, where regions non-essential for RNA replication have been deleted. Assayable genes might include a second dominant selectable marker, or those encoding proteins with convenient assays. Examples include, but are not restricted to, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, firefly or bacterial luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and humanized derivatives thereof, cell surface markers, and secreted markers. Such products are either assayed directly or may activate the expression or activity of additional reporters.</p><heading>Animal Models for HCV Infection and Replication</heading><p>In addition to chimpanzees, the present invention permits development of alternative animal models for studying HCV replication and evaluating novel therapeutics. Using the authentic HCV cDNA clones described in this invention as starting material, multiple approaches can be envisioned for establishing alternative animal models for HCV replication. In one manifestation, well-defined HCV stocks, produced by transfection of chimpanzees or by replication in cell culture, could be used to inoculate immunodeficient mice harboring human tissues capable of supporting HCV replication. An example of this art is the SCID:Hu mouse, where mice with a severe combined immunodeficiency are engrafted with various human (or chimpanzee) tissues, which could include, but are not limited to, fetal liver, adult liver, spleen, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Besides SCID mice, normal irradiated mice can serve as recipients for engraftment of human or chimpanzee tissues. These chimeric animals would then be substrates for HCV replication after either ex vivo or in vivo infection with defined virus-containing inocula.</p><p>In another manifestation, adaptive mutations allowing HCV replication in alternative species may produce variants which will be permissive for replication in these animals. For instance, adaptation HCV for replication and spread in either continuous rodent cell lines or primary tissues (such as hepatocytes) enables the virus to replication in small rodent models. Alternatively, complex libraries of HCV variants created by chemical or biological [Stemmer, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:10747 (1994)] methods can be created and used for inoculation of potentially susceptible animals. Such animals could be either irnmunocompetent or immunodeficient, as described above. Variants capable of replication can be isolated, molecularly cloned and then the adaptive mutations incorporated into a full-length clone, which is functional for replication in the selected non-human species.</p><p>The functional activity of HCV can be evaluated transgenically. In this respect, a transgenic mouse model can be used [see, e.g., Wilmut et al., Experientia 47:905 (1991)]. The HCV RNA or DNA clone can be used to prepare transgenic vectors, including viral vectors, or cosmid clones (or phage clones). Cosmids may be introduced into transgenic mice using published procedures [Jaenisch, Science, 240:1468-1474(1988)]. In the preparation of transgenic mice, embryonic stem cells are obtained from blastocyst embryos [Joyner, In Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. The Practical Approach Series, Rickwood, D., and Hames, B. D., Eds., IRL Press: Oxford (1993)] and transfected with HCV DNA or RNA. Transfected cells are injected into early embryos, e.g., mouse embryos, as described [Hammer et al., Nature 315:680 (1985); Joyner, supra]. Various techniques for preparation of transgenic animals have been described [U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,177, issued Jun. 25, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,898,604, issued Dec. 31, 1996]. Of particular interest are transgenic animal models in which the phenotypic or pathogenic effects of a transgene are studied. For example, the effects of a rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-bovine growth hormone fusion gene has been studied in pigs [Wieghart et al., J. Reprod. Fert., Suppl. 41:89-96 (1996)]. Transgenic mice that express of a gene encoding a human amyloid precursor protein associated with Alzheimer's disease are used to study this disease and other disorders [International Patent Publication WO 96/06927, published Mar. 7, 1996; Quon et al., Nature 352:239 (1991)]. Transgenic mice have also been created for the hepatitis delta agent [Polo et al., J. Virol. 69:5203 (1995)] and for hepatitis B virus [Chisar, Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 206:149 (1996)], and replication occurs in these engineered animals.</p><p>Thus, the functional cDNA clones described here, or parts thereof, can be used to create transgenic models relevant to HCV replication and pathogenesis. In one example, transgenic animals harboring the entire HCV genome can be created. Appropriate constructs for transgenic expression of the entire HCV genome in a transgenic mouse of the invention could include a nuclear promoter engineered to produce transcripts with the appropriate 5' terminus, the full-length HCV cDNA sequence, a cis-cleaving delta ribozyme [Ball, J. Virol. 66: 2335-2345 (1992); Pattnaik et al., Cell 69: 1011-1020 (1992)] to produce an authentic 3' terminus, followed possibly by signals that promote proper nuclear processing and transport to the cytoplasm (where HCV RNA replication occurs). Besides the entire HCV genome, animals can been engineered to express individual or various combinations of HCV proteins and RNA elements. For example, animals engineered to express an HCV gene product or reporter gene under the control of the HCV IRES can be used to evaluate therapies directed against this specific RNA target. Similar animal models can be envisioned for most known HCV targets.</p><p>Such alternative animal models are useful for (i) studying the effects of different antiviral agents on HCV replication in a whole animal system; (ii) examining potential direct cytotoxic effects of HCV gene products on hepatocytes and other cell types, defining the underlying mechanisms involved, and identifying and testing strategies for therapeutic intervention; and (iii) studying immune-mediated mechanisms of cell and tissue damage relevant to HCV pathogenesis and identifying and testing strategies for interfering with these processes.</p><heading>Selection and Analysis of Drug-Resistant Variants</heading><p>Cell lines and animal models supporting HCV replication can be used to examine the emergence of HCV variants with resistance to existing and novel therapeutics. Like all RNA viruses, the HCV replicase is presumed to lack proofreading activity and RNA replication is therefore error prone, giving rise to a high level of variation [Bukh et al., (1995) supra]. The variability manifests itself in the infected patient over time and in the considerable diversity observed between different isolates. The emergence of drug-resistant variants is likely to be an important consideration in the design and evaluation of HCV mono and combination therapies. HCV replication systems of the invention can be used to study the emergence of variants under various therapeutic formulations. These might include monotherapy or various combination therapies (e.g., IFN-α, ribavirin, and new antiviral compounds). Resistant mutants can then be used to define the molecular and structural basis of resistance and to evaluate new therapeutic formulations, or in screening assays for effective anti-HCV drugs (infra).</p><heading>Screening For Anti-HCV Agents</heading><p>HCV-permissive cell lines or animal models (preferably rodent models) can be used to screen for novel inhibitors or to evaluate candidate anti-HCV therapies. Such therapies include, but would not be limited to, (i) antisense oligonucleotides or ribozymes targeted to conserved HCV RNA targets; (ii) injectable compounds capable of inhibiting HCV replication; and (iii) orally bioavailable compounds capable of inhibiting HCV replication. Targets for such formulations include, but are not restricted to, (i) conserved HCV RNA elements important for RNA replication and RNA packaging; (ii) HCV-encoded enzymes; (iii) protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions important for HCV RNA replication, virus assembly, virus release, viral receptor binding, viral entry, and initiation of viral RNA replication; (iv) virus-host interactions modulating the ability of HCV to establish chronic infections; (v) virus-host interactions modulating the severity of liver damage, including factors affecting apoptosis and hepatotoxicity; (vi) virus-host interactions leading to the development of more severe clinical outcomes including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; and (vii) virus-host interactions resulting in other, less frequent, HCV-associated human diseases.</p><p>Evaluation of antisense and ribozyme therapies. The present invention extends to the preparation of antisense nucleotides and ribozymes that may be tested for the ability to interfere with HCV replication. This approach utilizes antisense nucleic acid and ribozymes to block translation of a specific mRNA, either by masking that mRNA with an antisense nucleic acid or cleaving it with a ribozyme.</p><p>Antisense nucleic acids are DNA or RNA molecules that are complementary to at least a portion of a specific mRNA molecule [see Marcus-Sekura, Anal. Biochem. 172:298 (1988)]. In the cell, they hybridize to that mRNA, forming a double stranded DNA:RNA or RNA:RNA molecule. The cell does not translate an mRNA in this double-stranded form. Therefore, antisense nucleic acids interfere with the expression of mRNA into protein. Oligomers of about fifteen nucleotides and molecules that hybridize to the AUG initiation codon will be particularly efficient, since they are easy to synthesize and are likely to pose fewer problems than larger molecules when introducing them into organ cells. Antisense methods have been used to inhibit the expression of many genes in vitro [Marcus-Sekura, 1988, supra; Hambor et al., J. Exp. Med. 168:1237 (1988)]. Preferably synthetic antisense nucleotides contain phosphoester analogs, such as phosphorothiolates, or thioesters, rather than natural phophoester bonds. Such phosphoester bond analogs are more resistant to degradation, increasing the stability, and therefore the efficacy, of the antisense nucleic acids.</p><p>In the genetic antisense approach, expression of the wild-type allele is suppressed because of expression of antisense RNA. This technique has been used to inhibit TK synthesis in tissue culture and to produce phenotypes of the Kruppel mutation in Drosophila, and the Shiverer mutation in mice [Izant et al., Cell, 36:1007-1015 (1984); Green et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem., 55:569-597 (1986); Katsuki et al., Science, 241:593-595 (1988)]. An important advantage of this approach is that only a small portion of the gene need be expressed for effective inhibition of expression of the entire cognate mRNA. The antisense transgene will be placed under control of its own promoter or another promoter expressed in the correct cell type, and placed upstream of the SV40 polyA site.</p><p>Ribozymes are RNA molecules possessing the ability to specifically cleave other single stranded RNA molecules in a manner somewhat analogous to DNA restriction endonucleases. Ribozymes were discovered from the observation that certain mRNAs have the ability to excise their own introns. By modifying the nucleotide sequence of these RNAs, researchers have been able to engineer molecules that recognize specific nucleotide sequences in an RNA molecule and cleave it [Cech, J. Am. Med. Assoc. 260:3030 (1988)]. Because they are sequence-specific, only mRNAs with particular sequences are inactivated.</p><p>Investigators have identified two types of ribozymes, Tetrahymena-type and "hammerhead"-type. Tetrahymena-type ribozymes recognize four-base sequences, while "hammerhead"-type recognize eleven- to eighteen-base sequences. The longer the recognition sequence, the more likely it is to occur exclusively in the target mRNA species. Therefore, hammerhead-type ribozymes are preferable to Tetrahymena-type ribozymes for inactivating a specific mRNA species, and eighteen base recognition sequences are preferable to shorter recognition sequences.</p><p>Screening compound libraries for anti-HCV activity. Various natural product or synthetic libraries can be screened for anti-HCV activity in the in vitro or in vivo models provided by the invention. One approach to preparation of a combinatorial library uses primarily chemical methods, of which the Geysen method [Geysen et al., Molecular Immunology 23:709-715 (1986); Geysen et al. J. Immunologic Method 102:259-274 (1987)] and the method of Fodor et al. [Science 251:767-773 (1991)] are examples. Furka et al. [14th International Congress of Biochemistry, Volume 5, Abstract FR:013 (1988); Furka, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 37:487-493 (1991)], Houghton [U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211, issued Dec. 1986] and Rutter et al. [U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,175, issued Apr. 23, 1991] describe methods to produce a mixture of peptides that can be tested for anti-HCV activity.</p><p>In another aspect, synthetic libraries [Needels et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10700-4 (1993); Ohlmeyer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10922-10926 (1993); Lam et al., International Patent Publication No. WO 92/00252; Kocis et al., International Patent Publication No. WO 9428028], and the like can be used to screen for anti-HCV compounds according to the present invention. These references, describe adaption of the library screening techniques in biological assays.</p><p>Defined/engineered HCV virus particles for neutralization assays. The functional clones described herein can be used to produce defined stocks of HCV-H particles for infectivity and neutralization assays. Homogeneous stocks can be produced in the chimpanzee model, in cell culture systems, or using various heterologous expression systems (e.g., baculovirus, yeast, mammalian cells; see supra). As described above, besides homogenous virus preparations of HCV-H, stocks of other genotypes or isolates can be produced. These stocks can be used in cell culture or in vivo assays to define molecules or gene therapy approaches capable of neutralizing HCV particle production or infectivity. Examples of such molecules include, but are not restricted to, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, artificial antibodies with engineered/optimized specificity, single-chain antibodies (see the section on antibodies, infra), nucleic acids or derivatized nucleic acids selected for specific binding and neutralization, small orally bioavailable compounds, etc. Such neutralizing agents, targeted to conserved viral or cellular targets, can be either genotype or isolate-specific or broadly cross-reactive. They could be used either prophylactically or for passive immunotherapy to reduce viral load and perhaps increase the chances of more effective treatment in combination with other antiviral agents (e.g., IFN-α, ribavirin, etc.). Directed manipulation of HCV infectious clones can also be used to produce HCV stocks with defined changes in the glycoprotein hypervariable regions or in other epitopes to study mechanisms of antibody neutralization, CTL recognition, immune escape and immune enhancement. These studies will lead to identification of other virus-specific functions for anti-viral therapy.</p><heading>Dissection of HCV Replication</heading><p>Other HCV replication assays. For the first time, this invention allows directed molecular genetic dissection of HCV replication. Such analyses are expected to (i) validate antiviral targets which are currently being pursued; and (ii) uncover unexpected new aspects of HCV replication amenable to therapeutic intervention. Targets for immediate validation through mutagenesis studies include the following: the 5' NTR, the HCV polyprotein and cleavage products, and the 3' NTR. As described above, analyses using the infectious clone technology and permissive cell cultures can be used to compare parental and mutant replication phenotypes after transfection of cell cultures with infectious RNA. Even though RT-PCR allows sensitive detection of viral RNA accumulation, mutations which decrease the efficiency of RNA replication may be difficult to analyze, unless conditional mutations are recovered. As a complement to first cycle analyses, trans-complementation assays can be used to facilitate analysis of HCV mutant phenotypes and inhibitor screening. Heterologous systems (vaccinia, Sindbis, or non-viral) can be used to drive expression of the HCV RNA replicase proteins and/or packaging machinery [see Lemm and Rice, J. Virol. 67: 1905-1915 (1993a); Lemm and Rice, J. Virol. 67: 1916-1926 (1993b); Lemm et al., EMBO J. 13: 2925-2934 (1994); Li et al., J. Virol. 65: 6714-6723 (1991)]. If these elements are capable of functioning in trans, then co-expression of RNAs with appropriate cis-elements should result in RNA replication/packaging. Such systems therefore mimic steps in authentic RNA replication and virion assembly, but uncouple production of viral components from HCV replication. If HCV replication is somehow self-limiting, heterologous systems may drive significantly higher levels of RNA replication or particle production, facilitating analysis of mutant phenotypes and antiviral screening. A third approach is to devise cell-free systems for HCV template-dependent RNA replication. A coupled translation/replication and assembly system has been described for poliovirus in HeLa cells [Barton and Flanegan, J. Virol. 67: 822-831 (1993); Molla et al., Science 254: 1647-1651 (1991)], and a template-dependent in vitro assay for initiation of negative-strand synthesis has been established for Sindbis virus. Similar in vitro systems for HCV are invaluable for studying many aspects of HCV replication as well as for inhibitor screening and evaluation. An example of each of these strategies follows.</p><p>Trans-complementation of HCVRNA replication and/or packaging using viral or non-viral expression systems. Heterologous systems can be used to drive HCV replication. For example, the vaccinia/T7 cytoplasmic expression system has been extremely useful for trans-complementation of RNA virus replicase and packaging functions [see Ball, (1992) supra; Lemm and Rice, (1993a) supra; Lemm and Rice, (1993b) supra; Lemm et al., (1994) supra; Pattnaik et al., (1992) supra; Pattnaik et al., Virology 206: 760-4 (1995); Porter et al., J. Virol 69: 1548-1555 (1995)). In brief, a vaccinia recombinant (vTF7-3) is used to express T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNApol) in the cell type of interest. Target cDNAs, positioned downstream from the T7 promoter, are delivered either as vaccinia recombinants or by plasmid transfection. This system leads to high level RNA and protein expression. A variation of this approach, which obviates the need for vaccinia (which could interfere with HCV RNA replication or virion formation), is the pT7T7 system where the T7 promoter drives expression of T7RNApol [Chen et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 22: 2114-2120. (1994)]. pT7T7 is mixed with T7RNApol (the protein) and co-transfected with the T7-driven target plasmid of interest. Added T7RNApol initiates transcription, leading to it own production and high level expression of the target gene. Using either approach, RNA transcripts with precise 5' and 3' termini can be produced using the T7 transcription start site (5') and the cis-cleaving HCV ribozyme (Rz) (3') [Ball, (1992) supra; Pattnaik et al., (1992) supra].</p><p>These or similar expression systems can be used to establish assays for HCV RNA replication and particle formation, and for evaluation of compounds which might inhibit these processes. In another extension of the HCV functional clone technology, T7-driven protein expression constructs and full-length HCV clones incorporating the HCV ribozyme following the 3' NTR are used. A typical experimental plan to validate the assay is described for pT7T7, although essentially similar assays can be envisioned using vTF7-3 or cell lines expressing the T7 RNA polymerase. HCV-permissive cells are co-transfected with pT7T7 +T7RNApol +p90/HCVFLlong pU Rz (or a negative control, such as ΔGDD). At different times post-transfection, accumulation of HCV proteins and RNAs, driven by the pT7T7 system, are followed by Western and Northern blotting, respectively. To assay for HCV-specific replicase function, Act. D is added to block DNA-dependent T7 transcription [Lemm and Rice, (1993a), supra] and Act. D-resistant RNA synthesis is monitored by metabolic labeling. Radioactivity will be incorporated into full-length HCV RNAs for p90/HCVFL long pU/Rz, but not for p90/HCVFLΔGDD/Rz. This assay system, or elaborated derivatives, can be used to screen for inhibitors and to study their effects on HCV RNA replication.</p><p>Cell-free systems for assaying HCV replication and inhibitors thereof Cell-free assays for studying HCV RNA replication and inhibitor screening can also be established using the functional cDNA clones described in this invention. Either virion or transcribed RNAs are used as substrate RNA. For HCV, full-length HCV RNAs transcribed in vitro can be used to program such in vitro systems and replication assayed essentially as described for poliovirus [see Barton et al., (1995) supra]. In case hepatocyte-specific or other factors are required for HCV RNA replication, the system can be supplemented with hepatocyte or other cell extracts, or alternatively, a comparable system can be established using cell lines which have been shown to be permissive for HCV replication.</p><p>One concern about this approach is that proper cell-free synthesis and processing of the HCV polyprotein must occur. Sufficient quantities of properly processed replicase components may be difficult to produce. To circumvent this problem, the T7 expression system can be used to express high levels of HCV replicase components in appropriate cells [see Lemm et al., (1997) supra]. P15 membrane fractions from these cells (with added buffer, Mg.sup.2+, an ATP regenerating system, and NTPs) should be able to initiate and synthesize full-length negative-strand RNAs upon addition of HCV-specific template RNAs.</p><p>Establishment of either or both of these assays allows rapid and precise analysis of the effects of HCV mutations, host factors, involved in replication and inhibitors of the various steps in HCV RNA replication. These systems will also establish the requirements for helper systems for preparing replication-deficient HCV vectors.</p><heading>Vaccination and Protective Immunity</heading><p>There are still many unknown parameters that impact on development of effective HCV vaccines. It is clear in both man and the chimpanzee that some individuals can clear the infection. Also, 10-20% of those treated with IFN appear to show a sustained response as evidenced by lack of circulating HCV RNA. Other studies have shown a lack of protective immunity, as evidenced by successful reinfection with both homologous virus as well as with more distantly related HCV types [Farci et al., (1992) supra; Prince et al., (1992) supra]. Nonetheless, chimpanzees immunized with subunit vaccines consisting of E1E2 oligomers and vaccinia recombinants expressing these proteins are partially protected against low dose challenges [Choo et al., Proc. natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:1294 (1994)]. The infectious clone technology described in this invention has utility not only for basic studies aimed at understanding the nature of protective immune responses against HCV, but also for novel vaccine production methods.</p><p>Active immunity against HCV can be induced by immunization (vaccination) with an immunogenic amount of an attenuated or inactivated HCV virion, or HCV virus particle proteins, preferably with an immunologically effective adjuvant. An "immunologically effective adjuvant" is a material that enhances the immune response.</p><p>Selection of an adjuvant depends on the subject to be vaccinated. Preferably, a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant is used. For example, a vaccine for a human should avoid oil or hydrocarbon emulsion adjuvants, including complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. One example of an adjuvant suitable for use with humans is alum (alumina gel). A vaccine for an animal, however, may contain adjuvants not appropriate for use with humans.</p><p>An alternative to a traditional vaccine comprising an antigen and an adjuvant involves the direct in vivo introduction of DNA or RNA encoding the antigen into tissues of a subject for expression of the antigen by the cells of the subject's tissue. Such vaccines are termed herein "DNA vaccines," "genetic vaccination," or "nucleic acid-based vaccines." Methods of transfection as described above, such as DNA vectors or vector transporters, can be used for DNA vaccines.</p><p>DNA vaccines are described in International Patent Publication WO 95/20660 and International Patent Publication WO 93/19183, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The ability of directly injected DNA that encodes a viral protein or genome to elicit a protective immune response has been demonstrated in numerous experimental systems [Conry et al., Cancer Res., 54:1164-1168 (1994); Cox et al., Virol, 67:5664-5667 (1993); Davis et al., Hum. Mole. Genet., 2:1847-1851 (1993); Sedegah et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 91:9866-9870 (1994); Montgomery et al., DNA Cell Bio., 12:777-783 (1993); Ulmer et al., Science, 259:1745-1749 (1993); Wang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 90:4156-4160 (1993); Xiang et al., Virology, 199:132-140 (1994)]. Studies to assess this strategy in neutralization of influenza virus have used both envelope and internal viral proteins to induce the production of antibodies, but in particular have focused on the viral hemagglutinin protein (HA) [Fynan et al., DNA Cell. Biol., 12:785-789 (1993A); Fynan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 90:11478-11482 (1993B); Robinson et al., Vaccine, 11:957, (1993); Webster et al., Vaccine, 12:1495-1498 (1994)].</p><p>Vaccination through directly injecting DNA or RNA that encodes a protein to elicit a protective immune response produces both cell-mediated and humoral responses. This is analogous to results obtained with live viruses [Raz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 91:9519-9523 (1994); Ulmer, 1993, supra; Wang, 1993, supra; Xiang, 1994, supra]. Studies with ferrets indicate that DNA vaccines against conserved internal viral proteins of influenza, together with surface glycoproteins, are more effective against antigenic variants of influenza virus than are either inactivated or subvirion vaccines [Donnelly et al., Nat. Medicine, 6:583-587 (1995)]. Indeed, reproducible immune responses to DNA encoding nucleoprotein have been reported in mice that last essentially for the lifetime of the animal [Yankauckas et al., DNA Cell Biol., 12: 771-776 (1993)].</p><p>A vaccine of the invention can be administered via any parenteral route, including but not limited to intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intraarterial (e.g., hepatic artery) and the like. Preferably, since the desired result of vaccination is to elucidate an immune response to HCV, administration directly, or by targeting or choice of a viral vector, indirectly, to lymphoid tissues, e.g., lymph nodes or spleen. Since immune cells are continually replicating, they are ideal target for retroviral vector-based nucleic acid vaccines, since retroviruses require replicating cells.</p><p>Passive immunity can be conferred to an animal subject suspected of suffering an infection with HCV by administering antiserum, neutralizing polyclonal antibodies, or a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HCV to the patient. Although passive immunity does not confer long term protection, it can be a valuable tool for the treatment of an acute infection of a subject who has not been vaccinated. Preferably, the antibodies administered for passive immune therapy are autologous antibodies. For example, if the subject is a human, preferably the antibodies are of human origin or have been "humanized," in order to minimize the possibility of an immune response against the antibodies. In addition, genes encoding neutralizing antibodies can be introduced in vectors for expression in vivo, e.g., in hepatocytes.</p><p>Antibodies for passive immune therapy. Preferably, HCV virions or virus particle proteins prepared as described above are used as an immunogen to generate antibodies that recognize HCV. Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single chain, Fab fragments, and an Fab expression library. Various procedures known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to HCV. For the production of antibody, various host animals can be immunized by injection with the HCV virions or polypeptide, e.g., as describe infra, including but not limited to rabbits, mice, rats, sheep, goats, etc. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium parvum.</p><p>For preparation of monoclonal antibodies directed toward HCV as described above, any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture may be used. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler and Milstein [Nature 256:495-497 (1975)], as well as the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique [Kozbor et al., Immunology Today 4:72 1983); Cote et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:2026-2030 (1983)], and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies [Cole et al., in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96 (1985)]. In an additional embodiment of the invention, monoclonal antibodies can be produced in germ-free animals [International Patent Publication No. WO 89/12690, published Dec. 28, 1989]. In fact, according to the invention, techniques developed for the production of "chimeric antibodies" [Morrison et al., J. Bacteriol. 159:870 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 312:604-608 (1984); Takeda et al., Nature 314:452-454 (1985)] by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule specific for HCV together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used; such antibodies are within the scope of this invention. Such human or humanized chimeric antibodies are preferred for use in therapy of human diseases or disorders (described infra), since the human or humanized antibodies are much less likely than xenogenic antibodies to induce an immune response, in particular an allergic response, themselves.</p><p>According to the invention, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies [U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,476,786 and 5,132,405 to Huston; U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778] can be adapted to produce HCV-specific single chain antibodies. An additional embodiment of the invention utilizes the techniques described for the construction of Fab expression libraries [Huse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989)] to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity.</p><p>Antibody fragments which contain the idiotype of the antibody molecule can be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments include but are not limited to: the F(ab').sub.2 fragment which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule; the Fab' fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab').sub.2 fragment, and the Fab fragments which can be generated by treating the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent.</p><p>HCV particles for subunit vaccination. The functional HCV-H cDNA clone, and similarly constructed and verified clones for other genotypes, can be used to produce HCV-like particles for vaccination. Proper glycosylation, folding, and assembly of HCV particles may be important for producing appropriately antigenic and protective subunit vaccines. Several methods can be used for particle production. They include engineering of stable cell lines for inducible or constitutive expression of HCV-like particles (using bacterial, yeast or mammalian cells), or the use of higher level eukaryotic heterologous expression systems such as recombinant baculoviruses, vaccinia viruses [Moss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93: 11341-11348 (1996)], or alphaviruses [Frolov et al., (1996) supra]. HCV particles for immunization may be purified from either the media or disrupted cells, depending upon their localization. Such purified HCV particles or mixtures of particles representing a spectrum of HCV genotypes, can be injected with our without various adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity.</p><p>Infectious non-replicating HCV particles. In another manifestation, HCV particles capable of receptor binding, entry, and translation of genome RNA can be produced. Heterologous expression approaches for production of such particles include, but are not restricted to, E. coli, yeast, or mammalian cell lines, appropriate host cells infected or harboring recombinant baculoviruses, recombinant vaccinia viruses, recombinant alphaviruses or RNA replicons, or recombinant adenoviruses, engineered to express appropriate HCV RNAs and proteins. In one example, two recombinant baculoviruses are engineered. One baculovirus expresses the HCV structural proteins (e.g. C-E1-E2-p7) required for assembly of HCV particles. A second recombinant expresses the entire HCV genome RNA, with precise 5' and 3' ends, except that a deletion, such as ΔGDD, is included to inactivate the HCV NS5B RDRP. Other mutations abolishing productive HCV replication could also be utilized instead or in combination. Coinfection of appropriate host cells (Sf9, Sf21, etc.) with both recombinants will produce high levels of HCV structural proteins and genome RNA for packaging into HCV-like particles. Such particles can be produced at high levels, purified, and used for vaccination. Once introduced into the vaccinee, such particles will exhibit normal receptor binding and infection of HCV-susceptible cells. Entry will occur and the genome RNA will be translated to produce all of the normal HCV antigens, except that further replication of the genome will be completely blocked given the inactivated SB polymerase. Such particles are expected to elicit effective CTL responses against structural and nonstructural HCV protein antigens. This vaccination strategy alone or preferably in conjunction with the subunit strategy described above can be used to elicit high levels of both neutralizing antibodies and CTL responses to help clear the virus. A variety of different HCV genome RNA sequences can be utilized to ensure broadly cross-reactive and protective immune responses. In addition, modification of the HCV particles, either through genetic engineering, or by derivatization in vitro, could be used to target infection to cells most effective at eliciting protective and long lasting immune responses.</p><p>Live-attenuated HCV derivatives. The ability to manipulate the HCV genome RNA sequence and thereby produce mutants with altered pathogenicity provides a means of constructing live-attenuated HCV mutants appropriate for vaccination. Such vaccine candidates express protective antigens but would be impaired in their ability to cause disease, establish chronic infections, trigger autoimmune responses, and transform cells. Naturally, infectious HCV virus of the invention can be attenuated, inactivated, or killed by chemical or heat treatment.</p><heading>HCV-based Gene Expression Vectors</heading><p>Some of the same properties of HCV leading to chronic liver infection of humans may also be of great utility for designing vectors for gene expression in cell culture systems, genetic vaccination, and gene therapy. The functional clones described herein can be engineered to produce chimeric RNAs designed for the expression of heterologous gene products (RNAs and proteins). Strategies have been described above and elsewhere [Bredenbeek and Rice, (1992) supra; Frolov et al., (1996) supra] and include, but are not limited to (i) in-frame fusion of the heterologous coding sequences with the HCV polyprotein; (ii) creation of additional cistrons in the HCV genome RNA; and (iii) inclusion of IRES elements to create multicistronic self-replicating HCV vector RNAs capable of expressing one or more heterologous genes (FIG. 2). Functional HCV RNA backbones utilized for such vectors include, but are not limited to, (i) live-attenuated derivatives capable of replication and spread; (ii) RNA replication competent "dead end" derivatives lacking one or more viral components required (e.g. the structural proteins) required for viral spread; (iii) mutant derivatives capable of high and low levels of HCV-specific RNA synthesis and accumulation; (iv) mutant derivatives adapted for replication in different human cell types; (v) engineered or selected mutant derivatives capable of prolonged noncytopathic replication in human cells. Vectors competent for RNA replication but not packaging or spread can be introduced either as naked RNA, DNA, or packaged into virus-like particles. Such virus-like particles can be produced as described above and composed of either unmodified or altered HCV virion components designed for targeted infection of the hepatocytes or other human cell types. Alternatively, HCV RNA vectors can be encapsidated and delivered using heterologous viral packaging machineries or encapsulated into liposomes modified for efficient gene delivery. These packaging strategies, and modifications thereof, can be utilized to efficiently target HCV vectors RNAs to specific cell types. Using methods detailed above, similar HCV-derived vector systems, competent for replication and expression in other species, can also be derived.</p><p>Various methods, e.g., as set forth supra in connection with transfection of cells and DNA vaccines, can be used to introduce an HCV vector of the invention. Of primary interest is direct injection of functional HCV RNA or virions, e.g., in the liver. Targeted gene delivery is described in International Patent Publication WO 95/28494, published October 1995. Alternatively, the vector can be introduced in vivo by lipofection. For the past decade, there has been increasing use of liposomes for encapsulation and transfection of nucleic acids in vitro. Synthetic cationic lipids designed to limit the difficulties and dangers encountered with liposome mediated transfection can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo transfection of a gene encoding a marker [Felgner, et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:7413-7417 (1987); see Mackey, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:8027-8031 (1988); Ulmer et al., Science 259:1745-1748 (1993)]. The use of cationic lipids may promote encapsulation of negatively charged nucleic acids, and also promote fusion with negatively charged cell membranes [Felgner and Ringold, Science 337:387-388 (1989)]. The use of lipofection to introduce exogenous genes into the specific-organs in vivo has certain practical advantages. Molecular targeting of liposomes to specific cells represents one area of benefit. It is clear that directing transfection to particular cell types would be particularly advantageous in a tissue with cellular heterogeneity, such as pancreas, liver, kidney, and the brain. Lipids may be chemically coupled to other molecules for the purpose of targeting [see Mackey, et. al., supra]. Targeted peptides, e.g., hormones or neurotransmitters, and proteins such as antibodies, or non-peptide molecules could be coupled to liposomes chemically. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery approaches can also be used [Curiel et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 3:147-154 (1992); Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:44294432 (1987)].</p><p>Examples of applications for gene therapy include, but are not limited to, (i) expression of enzymes or other molecules to correct inherited or acquired metabolic defects; (ii) expression of molecules to promote wound healing; (iii) expression of immunomodulatory molecules to promote immune-mediated regression or elimination of human cancers; (iv) targeted expression of toxic molecules or enzymes capable of activating cytotoxic drugs in tumors; (v) targeted expression of anti-viral or anti-microbial agents in pathogen-infected cells. Various therapeutic heterologous genes can be inserted in a gene therapy vector of the invention, such as but not limited to adenosine deaminase (ADA) to treat severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID); marker genes or lymphokine genes into tumor infiltrating (TIL) T cells [Kasis et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:473 (1990); Culver et al., ibid. 88:3155 (1991)]; genes for clotting factors such as Factor VIII and Factor IX for treating hemophilia [Dwarki et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92:1023-1027 (19950); Thompson, Thromb. and Haemostatis, 66:119-122 (1991)]; and various other well known therapeutic genes such as, but not limited to, β-globin, dystrophin, insulin, erythropoietin, growth hormone, glucocerebrosidase, β-glucuronidase, α-antitrypsin, phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, ornithine transcarbamylase, apolipoproteins, and the like. In general, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346 to Anderson et al.</p><p>Examples of applications for genetic vaccination (for protection from pathogens other than HCV) include, but are not limited to, expression of protective antigens from bacterial (e.g., uropathogenic E. coli, Streptoccoci, Staphlococci, Nisseria), parasitic (e.g., Plasmodium, Leishmania, Toxoplama), fungal (e.g., Candida, Histoplasma), and viral (e.g., HIV, HSV, CMV, influenza) human pathogens. Immunogenicity of protective antigens expressed using HCV-derived RNA expression vectors can be enhanced using adjuvants, including co-expression of immunomodulatory molecules, such as cytokines (e.g., IL-2, GM-CSF) to facilitate development of desired Th1 versus Th2 responses. Such adjuvants can be either incorporated and co-expressed by HCV vectors themselves or administered in combination with these vectors using other methods.</p><heading>Diagnostic Methods for Infectious HCV</heading><p>Diagnostic cell lines. The invention described herein can also be used to derive cell lines for sensitive diagnosis of infectious HCV in patient samples. In concept, functional HCV components are used to test and create susceptible cell lines (as identified above) in which easily assayed reporter systems are selectively activated upon HCV infection. Examples include, but are not restricted to, (i) defective HCV RNAs lacking replicase components that are incorporated as transgenes and whose replication is upregulated or induced upon HCV infection; (ii) sensitive heterologous amplifiable reporter systems activated by HCV infection. In the first manifestation, cis RNA signals required for HCV RNA amplification flank a convenient reporter gene, such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), β-galactosidase, or a selectable marker (see above). Expression of such chimeric RNAs is driven by an appropriate nuclear promoter and elements required for proper nuclear processing and transport to the cytoplasm. Upon infection of the engineered cell line with HCV, cytoplasmic replication and amplification of the transgene is induced, triggering higher levels of reporter expression, as an indicator of productive HCV infection.</p><p>In the second example, cell lines are designed for more tightly regulated but highly inducible reporter gene amplification and expression upon HCV infection. Although this amplfied system is described in the context of specific components, other equivalent components can be used. In one such system, diagrammed in FIG. 3, an engineered alphavirus replicon transgene is created which lacks the alphavirus nsP4 polymerase, an enzyme absolutely required for alphavirus RNA amplification and normally produced by cleavage from the nonstructural polyprotein. Additional features of this defective alphavirus replicon include a subgenomic RNA promoter, driving expression of a luciferase or GFP reporter gene. This promoter element is quiescent in the absence of productive cytoplasmic alphavirus replication. The cell line contains a second transgene for expression of gene fusion consisting of the HCV NS4A protein and the alphavirus nsP4 RDRP. This fused gene is expressed and targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane compartment, but this form of nsP4 would be inactive as a functional component of the alphavirus replication complex because a discrete nsP4 protein, with a precise N terminus is required for nsP4 activity [Lemm et al., EMBO J. 13:2925 (1994)]. An optional third transgene expresses a defective alphavirus RNA with cis signals for replication, transcription of subgenomic RNA encoding a ubiquitin-nsP4 fusion, and an alphavirus packaging signal. Upon infection of such a cell line by HCV, the HCV NS3 proteinase is produced and mediate trans cleavage of the NS4A-nsP4 fusion protein, activating the nsP4 polymerase. This active polymerase, which functions in trans and is effective in minute amounts, then forms a functional alphavirus replication complex leading to amplification of the defective alphavirus replicon as well as the defective alphavirus RNA encoding ubiquitin-nsP4. Ubiquitin-nsP4, expressed from its subgenomic RNA, is cleaved efficiently by cellular ubiquitin carboxyterminal hydrolase to product additional nsP4, in case this enzyme is limiting. Once activated, this system would produce extremely high levels of the reporter protein. The time scale of such an HCV infectivity assay is expected to take just hours (for sufficient reporter gene expression).</p><p>Antibody diagnostics. In addition to the cell lines described here, HCV virus particles (virions) produced by the transfected or infected cell lines, or isolated from an inflected animal, may be used as antigens to detect anti-HCV antibodies in patient blood or blood products. Because the HCV virus particles are derived from an authentic HCV genome, they are likely to have structural characteristics that more closely resemble or are identical to natural HCV virus. These reagents can be used to establish that a patient is infected with HCV by detecting seroconversion, i.e., generation of a population of HCV-specific antibodies.</p><p>Alternatively, antibodies generated to the authentic HCV products prepared as described herein can be used to detect the presence of HCV in biological samples from a subject.</p><p>The present invention may be better understood by reference to the following non-limiting Examples, which are provided as exemplary of the invention.</p><heading>EXAMPLES</heading><p>The following examples report on the background experimental work, initial unsuccessful efforts to prepare an HCV DNA encoding infectious HCV RNA, and finally generation of a functional clone.</p><heading>Example 1</heading><p>Analysis of HCV-H Genome Structure and Expression</p><p>Rationale for the HCV-H strain, cDNA cloning, sequence analysis, and assembly of nearly full-length cDNA clones. HCV-H strain was chosen for the initial studies since this isolate has been extensively characterized in chimpanzees by Purcell and colleagues [see Shimizu et al., (1990) supra] and more recently in vitro by Shimizu and coworkers [Hijikata et al., (1993) supra; Shimizu et al., J. Virol. 68: 1494-1500 (1994); Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 5477-5481 (1992); Shimizu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 6037-6041 (1993)]. HCV-H is a genotype la human isolate from an American with posttransfusion NANB hepatitis [Feinstone et al., J. Infect. Dis. 144: 588-598 (1981)].</p><p>Initial cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of HCV-H. The original HCV-H77 isolate was passaged twice in chimpanzees, both of whom developed elevated serum ALT levels and acute hepatitis. Liver tissue from the second chimpanzee passage was used for preparation of crude RNA suitable for cDNA synthesis and nested PCR amplification. PCR-amplified cDNA was cloned into plasmid expression vectors and several independent clones were isolated and used for sequence analysis, expression studies and reconstructing longer cDNA clones. Utilizing partial sequence data and restriction enzyme mapping, a clone containing the nearly the entire HCV-H cDNA, called pTET/T7HCVFLCMR, was assembled and sequenced [Daemer et al., unpublished; Grakoui et al., J. Virol. 67: 1385-1395 (1993c)]. The HCV sequence contained in this plasmid is subsequently referred to as HCV-H CMR (SEQ ID NO:19). The sequence of this clone is colinear and 98.5% homologous (at the nucleotide level) to the chimp-passaged HCV-H77 sequence published by Inchauspe et al. [Inchauspe et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 10292-10296 (1991)] and shows even greater similarity to the partial HCV-H90 sequences published by Ogata et al. [Ogata et al., (1991) supra].</p><p>Characterization of a prototype HCV-H clone. HCV-H cDNA clones and immune reagents have been used in cell-free translation and cell culture transient expression assays to provide a fairly detailed picture of HCV-H gene expression. In general terms, these results are similar to those obtained by others for different HCV genotypes. This work included: (i) the identification and mapping of HCV-H polyprotein cleavage products [Grakoui et al., (1993c) supra; Lin et al., (1994a) supra]; (ii) determining the sites of proteolytic processing [Grakoui et al., J. Virol. 67: 2832-2843 (1993a); Grakoui et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 10583-10587 (1993b); Lin et al., (1994a ) supra]; (iii) characterization of the NS2-3 autoproteinase [Grakoui et al., (1993b) supra; Reed et al., J. Virol. 69: 4127-4136 (1995)], the NS3-4A serine proteinase [Grakoui et al., (1993a) supra; Lin et al., J. Virol. 68: 8147-8157 (1994b); Lin and Rice, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 7622-7626 (1995); Lin et al., J. Virol. 69: 4373-4380 (1995)] and their cleavage requirements [Kolykhalov et. al., J. Virol. 68: 7525-7533 (1994); Reed et al., (1995) supra]; (iv) studies on the NS4A serine proteinase cofactor and its association with NS3 [Lin et al., (1994b) supra; Lin and Rice, (1995) supra; Lin et al., (1995) supra]; and (v) an examination of HCV glycoprotein biogenesis including folding and association with calnexin, oligomer formation, and subcellular localization [Dubuisson et al., (1994) supra; Dubuisson and Rice, (1996) supra]. Assays for other biologically important activities have been developed using the prototype HCV-H cDNA clones, including RNA-stimulated NTPase and RNA helicase activities associated with partially purified NS3 [Suzich et al., (1993) supra] and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Antigens expressed from this cloned cDNA can also be recognized by sera [see Ref. Grakoui et al., (1993c) supra] and cytotoxic T lymphocytes [Battegay et al., J. Virol. 69: 2462-2470 (1995); Koziel et al., J. Clin. Invest. 96:2311-21 (1995)] from patients with chronic HCV infections.</p><p>For the present invention, the work on HCV polyprotein processing provided a means of prescreening candidate full-length clones for a functional IRES element, an intact ORF, and proper membrane topology and active viral proteinases as evidenced by the production of all 10 polyprotein cleavage products.</p><heading>Example 2</heading><p>First Attempt At Recovery of Functional HCV from cDNA</p><p>Plasmid constructions. The preferred strategy for production of high specific infectivity potentially infectious HCV RNA transcripts [see Ahlquist et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 7066-7070 (1984); Rice et al., New Biol. 1: 285-296 (1989); Rice et al., (1987) supra and refs. therein], involved cloning of candidate full-length HCV cDNAs immediately downstream from a bacteriophage promoter (SP6 or T7) with a unique restriction site following the HCV 3' terminus for production of run off RNA transcripts (FIG. 4). The T7 or SP6 transcription systems were chosen for production of potentially infectious RNAs for several reasons. First, numerous examples exist for other RNA viruses where either T7 or SP6 have been successfully used to transcribe high yields of relatively high specific infectivity capped or uncapped RNA transcripts [Boyer and Haenni, J. Gen. Virol. 198: 415-426 (1994)]. In addition, the T7 system is particularly useful since it allows not only in vitro synthesis of defined RNAs for transfection, but also several in vivo approaches using transfection of plasmid DNA. One example is the vaccinia-T7 system where a vaccinia recombinant expressing the T7 RNA polymerase allows cytoplasmic transcription of transfected plasmid templates [Fuerst et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 8122-8126 (1986)]. A second in vivo approach, obviating the need for vaccinia virus, is cotransfection of a plasmid expressing T7 RNA polymerase [Chen et al., (1994) supra]. Transfection with HCV plasmid DNAs, designed for production of transcripts with defined 5' and 3' termini, might be advantageous given the susceptibility of long RNAs to degradation during transfection procedures [Ball, (1992) supra; Pattnaik et al., (1992) supra]. However, these in vivo methods do not allow precise control over the structure of the transcribed RNA and their export to the cytoplasm where HCV RNA replication is believed to occur. Hence, the in vitro transcription method has usually employed in our work.</p><p>The sequenced prototype HCV-H cDNA clone used for the majority of the processing studies was the starting material for these constructions. Since the terminal sequences of the HCV-H genome RNA were unknown when these experiments were initiated, sequences reported for other isolates were used to engineer the 5' and 3' ends by PCR. For the first set of constructs tested (FIG. 4), the additional 5' terminal sequence was derived from HCV-1 isolate [Han et al., (1991) supra]. For the 3' NTR, plasmids with two alternative structures were constructed. One pair (SP6 or T7) contained the 3' NTR and terminal poly (A) tract reported for HCV-1 by Han [Han et al., (1991) supra]. A second pair was constructed using a consensus 3' NTR sequence for all other isolates followed by a 3' terminal poly (U) tract.</p><p>Methods for assaying infectivity of HCV RNA. A desirable method for initial identification of potentially functional clones would be to screen for RNA replication after transfection of permissive cell cultures. While several laboratories have reported infection and replication in various cell cultures (see Background of the Invention, supra, and below), these systems are extremely inefficient, poorly characterized, and difficult to reproduce. Factors precluding efficient replication in vitro are unknown but may involve one or multiple stages in the virus life cycle (attachment, entry, RNA replication, assembly or release). Furthermore, no one has shown that HCV produced in cell culture is "authentic", e.g., capable of causing disease in the chimpanzee model. For these reasons, as well the technical difficulties associated with unambiguously demonstrating replication after RNA transfection, the chimpanzee model was used to identify functional clones from the library. Surgical procedures and direct intrahepatic inoculation were used, since this technique had been successful for demonstrating infectivity of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus virion RNA [Ohlinger et al., J. Virol. 64: 3331-3336 (1990)] and for hepatitis A virus RNA produced by in vitro transcription [Emerson et al., J. Virol. 66: 6649-6654 (1992)].</p><heading>Chimpanzee experiment I</heading><p>Capped or uncapped full-length RNA transcripts were synthesized from each of the four linearized plasmid templates and assayed for infectivity by direct intrahepatic inoculation of chimpanzee liver using a percutaneous liver biopsy technique. Briefly, after RNA transcription, reactions were digested with DNase, extracted with phenol, and the RNAs collected by ethanol precipitation. The yield and integrity of each transcript RNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Equal amounts of each of the poly (U)- or poly (A)-containing transcripts (SP6, T7, capped, uncapped) were pooled and assayed separately in two animals. These animals had not previously been exposed to HCV or pooled blood products and were HCV antibody and RNA negative. For each animal, two injection sites were used. At one site, 200 μg pooled RNA in 1 ml RNase-free PBS was injected. At the second site, 200 μg pooled RNA mixed with 0.8 ml RNase-free PBS and 200 μl LIPOFECTIN (BRL) was injected. Pre- and post-inoculation plasma and liver biopsy samples were collected weekly. Plasma samples were assayed for ALT and GGTP (indicators of liver damage), for HCV-specific antibodies using available serological assays, and for evidence of circulating HCV RNA by RT/PCR. Besides histologic examination of liver biopsy tissue, samples were also stored for possible analysis by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Despite following the animals for 6 months, no evidence of productive HCV infection was found using any of these assays.</p><p>Using methods described more fully below, transcripts from these clones were also assayed for infectivity in several different cell types. In some cases, HCV antigens could be detected in transfected cells for several days; however, similar results were obtained using control HCV transcripts containing a deletion in the NS5B RDRP, which should be inactive for replication. Thus, no convincing evidence for replication was obtained in the first set of experiments.</p><heading>Example 3</heading><p>Second Attempt to Recover HCV from cDNA</p><p>Possible reasons for failure of Attempt I. Several possible explanations, alone or in combination, could account for previous unsuccessful attempts to recover infectious HCV RNA from prototype HCV-H clones (pTET/HCVFLCMR). These include missing or incorrect terminal sequences, internal errors deleterious or lethal for HCV replication, or inadequate methods for assaying infectivity and replication. To address the first concern, the HCV-H 5' and 3' terminal sequences were rigorously determined. To increase the chances of recovering a full-length clone free of deleterious errors, high fidelity RT/PCR and assembly PCR was used to construct a new library of full-length HCV-H clones which included the new terminal sequences. Multiple clones from the library were tested for infectivity in the chimpanzee model.</p><p>Rationale for rigorously determining the HCV-H termini. As mentioned above, the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of HCV-H were unknown; the previous attempts (Example 2) to generate functional transcripts were from cDNA clones bearing terminal sequences determined for other HCV isolates. Study in other RNA virus systems has shown that specific terminal sequences are critical for the generation of functional, replication competent RNAs [reviewed in Boyer and Haenni, (1994) supra]. Such sequences are believed to be involved in initiation of negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis. In some cases, a few additional bases, or even longer non-viral sequences, are tolerated at the 5' and 3' termini; these sequences are typically lost or selected against during authentic viral replication. For other RNA viruses, extra bases, particularly at the 5' terminus, are deleterious. In contrast, transcripts lacking authentic terminal sequences are usually non-functional. For instance, deletion of the 3' terminal secondary structure or conserved sequence elements in the 3' NTR of flavivirus genome RNA is lethal for YF or TBE RNA replication. Given the importance of these sequence elements for other viruses, we have attempted to more rigorously determine the HCV-H terminal sequences.</p><p>Structure of the HCV-H 5' NTR. Methods used to amplify and clone the extreme 5' termini of RNAs include homopolymer tailing or ligation of synthetic oligonucleotides to first-strand cDNA (5' RACE) [Schaefer, Anal. Biochem. 227: 255-273 (1995)], cyclization of first-strand cDNA followed by inverse PCR [Zeiner and Gehring, BioTechniques 17: 1051-1053 (1994)], or cyclization of genome RNA with RNA ligase (after treatment to remove 5' cap structures, if necessary) followed by cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification across the 5'-3' junction [Mandl et al., Biotechniques 10: 486 (1991)]. Each of these approaches has its own set of problems, especially for rare RNAs. Despite this, 5' terminal sequences have been determined for a number of HCV isolates and are in general agreement. For HCV-H, both the cyclization/inverse PCR and 5' RACE methods were used to determine a 5'-terminal consensus sequence for HCV-H RNA from high titer H77 plasma (new data for HCV-H are shown in bold): 5'-GCCAGCCCCCTGATGGGGGCGACACTCCACCATGAATC . . . -3' (SEQ ID NO:3) This sequence is highly homologous to those determined for other isolates, but differs from our prototype full-length cDNA sequence at two positions (underlined). At lower frequency, clones with additional 5' residues (usually 1 additional G) were also recovered. Table 1 summarizes the results of the 5' terminal analyses.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 1______________________________________Results of the 5' end analysis of the HCV H cDNA clones.

Besides theses sequenced clones, eighteen clones with one additional 5' base were identified by restriction analysis. Of note is the observation that a sequence reported for a genotype 1b isolate initiates with a U residue (5'-UGCCA . . . -3'). Although these results might indicate the presence of additional sequences or heterogeneity at the HCV 5' terminus, the additional bases may be artifactual and created by partial copying of a 5' cap structure or addition of non-templated 3' bases by reverse transcriptase during first-strand cDNA synthesis. It cannot be excluded that the 5' terminus of HCV genome RNA contains a 5' cap structure or a convalently linked terminal protein such as VPg of the picornaviruses [Vartapetian and Bogdanov, Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol 34: 209-51 (1987)]. These possibilities will remain unresolved until it becomes possible to directly determine the structure of the 5' terminus of HCV genome RNA. For the pestiviruses, recent results suggest that genome RNAs may not contain a 5' cap [Brock et al., J. Virol. Meth. 38: 39-46 (1992)]and that this structure is not required for infectivity of transcribed RNA [Meyers et al., J. Virol. 70: 8606-8613 (1996a); Meyers et al., J. Virol. 70: 1588-95 (1996b); Moormann et al., J. Virol 70: 763-70 (1996); Ruggli et al., J. Virol 70: 3478-87 (1996); Vassilev et al., J. Virol. 71: 471-478 (1997)].</p><p>Structure of the HCV-H 3' NTR. Determination of the extreme 3' terminal HCV sequences is describe in co-pending, co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/520,678, filed Aug. 29, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,565, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and PCT International Application No. PCT/US96/14033, filed Aug. 28, 1996. Briefly, these results showed that the HCV 3' NTR consists of three elements (positive-sense, 5' to 3'): (i) a short sequence with significant variability among genotypes; (ii) a homopolymeric poly (U) tract followed by a polypyrimidine stretch consisting of mainly U with interspersed C residues and; (iii) a novel sequence of 98 bases. This novel 98-base sequence was not present in human genomic DNA and is highly conserved among HCV genotypes. The 3'-terminal 46 bases are predicted to form a stable stem-loop structure. Using a quantitative-competitive RT/PCR assay, a substantial fraction of HCV genome RNAs from a high specific-infectivity inoculum were found to contain this 3' terminal sequence element. These results indicated that the HCV genome RNA terminates with a highly conserved RNA element, which is likely to be required for authentic HCV replication and therefore, for recovery of infectious RNA from cDNA. These results have been confirmed by two other groups [Tanaka et al., (1995) supra; Tanaka et al., (1996) supra; Yamada et al., (1996) supra]. A large number of clinical isolates have also been examined and shown to contain the novel conserved 3' terminal element [Umlauft et al., J. Clin. Invest. 34: 2552-2558 (1996)].</p><p>Recipient vector containing the HCV H77 5' and 3' consensus sequences. Based on our analysis of the HCV H terminal sequences, a recipient vector was constructed that contained the determined consensus H77 sequences 5' to the KpnI (580) and 3' fo the NotI (9219) site (these terminal HCV sequences are identical to those in p90/HCVFlong pU, see below, SEQ ID NO:5). This vector is designated pTET/T7HCVΔBglII/5'3' corr. and was used for construction of the combinatorial full-length library described below.</p><p>Additional considerations for construction of full-length cDNA libraries for the HCV-H strain. As for the previous attempt (Example 2), the strategy for the second try involved the construction of full-length cDNA templates in plasmid vectors that could be transcribed in vitro or in vivo using bacteriophage DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Besides having correct 5' and 3' termini, RNA transcripts must also encode a full complement of functional HCV polypeptides. To minimize the possibility of cloning defective HCV genomes, high specific infectivity HCV-H plasma (H77) was used as a source of virion RNA for our new libraries (as mentioned earlier, the previous clone was assembled from cDNA made from infected chimp liver RNA). However, reverse transcription and multiple cycles of amplification prior to cDNA cloning raised the chances that HCV cDNA templates would contain one or more mutations deleterious for virus replication. For these reasons, complex libraries of full-length clones were constructed using high fidelity assembly PCR and then screened in pools for production of infectious RNA.</p><p>Construction of a new library of full-length HCV-H cDNA clones. We screened 41 HCV primer pairs and found 11 sets useful for amplifying overlapping 1-4 kb portions of the genome RNA (FIG. 5 and Tables 2 and 3).</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 2______________________________________Oligonucleotides used for amplification of HCV-H  cDNA.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 2216-2220 (1994); Lundberg et al., Gene 108: 1-6 (1991)]. Such intermediate PCR products were combined to produce full-length HCV cDNA using sequential rounds of assembly PCR [Mullis et al., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. 51: 263-273 (1986); Stemmer, (1994) supra]. Assembly PCR utilized primers at the extreme termini of the two overlapping fragments to be combined and a limited number of amplification cycles (FIG. 6). This approach has the advantage of generating complex combinatorial libraries which should contain some fraction of functional error-free HCV cDNA templates. A prime consideration for this approach is making sure that the library contains sufficient complexity to assure that some clones will be error-free. For each of the initial amplification reactions, dilutions of the first-strand cDNA were tested (FIG. 7) to show that multiple independent cDNA molecules were being amplified (greater than 7 to 100; indicated in FIG. 5). As shown in FIG. 7, the full-length library contained greater than 5.6.times.10.sup.5 (80 deleterious mutations could have been introduced into half of the clones if the primer sequences chosen for PCR amplification and assembly were incorrect. However, it was later verified that no heterogeneity existed in the sequences corresponding to the primers used for PCR.</p><p>The majority of the HCV-H77 genome (from nucleotide 39-9352) was assembled and amplified in this manner and cloned as a KpnI (580)-NotI (9219) fragment into recipient plasmid (pTET/T7HCVΔBglII5'3'corr.) to produce the full-length library. As described above, pTET/T7HCVΔBglII5'3'corr. contains the T7 promoter, the consensus HCV-H 5' and 3'-terminal sequences 5' to the KpnI site and 3' from the NotI site, and a HpaI site for template linearization and production of run-off RNA transcripts. It should be noted that linearization with HpaI is predicted to produce run-off transcripts that contain one extra 3' U residue.</p><p>Clones from the library were chosen for infectivity assays based on two criteria. First, series of restriction digests were performed to eliminate clones that had obvious deletions or insertions in the HCV cDNA. Two hundred thirty-three clones were analyzed and clones passing this screen were then analyzed using the vaccinia-T7 transient expression system [see Grakoui et al., (1993a) supra; Grakoui et al., (1993c) supra] for production of the expected HCV polyprotein cleavage products. Full-length clones could be analyzed directly using this technique, since preliminary studies in BHK cells showed that the HCV IRES functions nearly as efficiently as the EMCV IRES for expression of HCV polypeptides. One hundred twenty-nine clones were screened using a polyclonal antiserum from a patient with chronic HCV (JHF; Grakoui et al., 1993c ); 49 clones were analyzed for production of NS5B, the C-terminal protein in the HCV-H ORF [Grakoui et al., 1993a; Grakoui et al., 1993c ). Thirty-four clones passing these tests (expected restriction pattern; intact ORF and proper processing; NS5B production) were selected for in vitro transcription of potentially infectious RNA and infectivity analysis.</p><p>Special conditions for transcription of fill-length HCV RNA containing the internal poly (U/UC) tract and the 98-base element. For T7-driven transcription, in vitro transcription conditions were optimized and showed that the resulting RNAs contain the extreme 3' terminal sequence. This was of special concern since the T7 RNA polymerase termination signals (a secondary structure followed by poly-U) resemble the HCV sequences preceding the 3' novel element and we observed termination at this site. In addition, the enzyme seemed to be prone to premature termination inside the poly (U/UC) tract. As shown in FIG. 8A, by raising the UTP concentration to 3 mM in the transcription reaction, high yields of full-length HCV RNA transcripts were obtained. T7 polymerase was clearly better in this regard than SP6 polymerase, which exhibited significant premature termination in the poly (U) tract even at relatively high concentrations of UTP.</p><heading>Chimpanzee experiment II</heading><p>Essentially as described above (Example 2), surgical procedures and direct intrahepatic inoculation were used to assay the infectivity of transcribed RNAs. Three animals, not previously used for HCV work and negative for HCV serology and RNA, were inoculated. Each of two of the animals were injected with RNA transcripts from 17 independent clones, with inoculations at 34 separate sites in the liver. Two separate inoculations used for each transcript preparation were: 50-100 μg RNA in PBS injected at one site and 1 μg RNA mixed with 10 μg lipofectin (a cationic liposome which enhances RNA transfection [see Rice et al., (1989) supra] at a second site. This procedure was intended to maximize the chances of productive transfection for each clone/RNA preparation. As a negative control, a third animal (Chimp 1557) was similarly inoculated at 34 sites with transcripts (˜1500 μg) which contained a 21 residue in-frame deletion in NS5B encompassing the active site of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (called ΔGDD). Following inoculation, serum samples were collected (at weekly intervals) and analyzed for HCV RNA, elevation of liver transaminases, and HCV-specific antibody. Neither experimental animal nor the negative control animal (ΔGDD) exhibited signs of productive infection (circulating HCV RNA, elevated liver enzymes, histopathology). Of note for future experiments was the complete absence of detectable circulating HCV RNA even as early as one week after inoculation.</p><heading>Example 4</heading><p>Successful Recovery of Infectious HCV from cDNA</p><p>Determination of the HCV-H consensus sequence. Since the limited pool screening approach was unsuccessful, we determined a complete consensus sequence for the HCV-H strain. Segments of these sequenced clones were used for directed assembly of full-length HCV-H clones having the consensus sequence. This procedure was expected to eliminate lethal mutations, which might have occurred during cDNA synthesis or PCR amplification, or which existed in the original HCV population. Accordingly, the consensus method had a strong chance of producing functional HCV.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 4______________________________________Sequence information used to determine an HCV-H consensus sequence  Designation   Description______________________________________HCV-H CMR   CMR prototype HCV-H cDNA clone; infected   chimp liver RNA (SEQ ID NO:19)  HCV-H GenBank                      HCV-H sequence  AAK#83                             Combinatorial library clone #83; H77       serum  AAK#84                             Combinatorial library clone #84; H77       serum  AAK#86                             Combinatorial library clone #86; H77       serum  AAK#87                             Combinatorial library clone #87; H77       serum  AAK#89                             Combinatorial library clone #89; H77       serum  AAK#90                             Combinatorial library clone #90; H77       serum  AAK#92                             Combinatorial library clone #92; H77       serum  AAK#93                             Combinatorial library clone #93; H77       serum  AAK#96                             Combinatorial library clone #96; H77       serum  AAK#99                             Combinatorial library clone #99; H77       serum  AAK#101                            Combinatorial library clone #101;       H77 serum  AAK#248                            Combinatorial library clone #248;       H77 serum  AAK#227                            Combinatorial library clone #227;       H77 serum  AAK#213                            Combinatorial library clone #213;       H77 serum  AAK#211                             Combinatorial library clone #211;       H77 serum  AAK#209                             Combinatorial library clone #209;       H77 serum  AAK#12                              Combinatorial library clone #12;       H77 serum______________________________________</pre></p><p>Complete sequences between the KpnI (580) and NotI (9219) sites in the HCV cDNA were determined for clones AAK#248, AAK#227, AAK#213, AAK#21 1, AAK#209, and AAK#12. Sequences for the prototype HCV-H CMR [Daemer et al., supra; Grakoui et al., (1993c) supra] and HCV-H GenBank [Inchauspe et al., (1991) supra] had been determined previously. These sequences are aligned in FIG. 9. Dots indicate positions identical to the HCV-H CMR sequence, shown at the bottom (SEQ ID NOS:19 and 20); dashes indicate gaps; the sequence "PCR seq" was determined by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HCV-H77 cDNA. Sequences of additional clones from our combinatorial library (AAK#83, #84, #86, #87, #89, #90, #92, #93, #95, #96, #99, #101) were determined for the HVR1 hypervariable region in E2 (most were sequenced between nucleotides 1464-1823; see below). Inspection of the alignment reveals an HCV H77 consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) at most positions. At some positions, however, no clear consensus sequence emerged. These variable positions were: 2170 (Gac versus Aac; variable base is indicated in upper case type), 3940 (gAg versus gGg), and 5560 (caA versus caT). In these cases, the sequence used in the consensus clone corresponded to the nucleotide yielding the amino acid found at that position for the majority of sequenced HCV isolates.</p><p>Regarding determination of a consensus sequence, additional areas of the HCV genome deserve further comment. First, the N-terminal portion of E2 is highly variable and believed to be the target of immune selection [Houghton, (1996) supra]. In the H77 sample, considerable variability exists in HVR1 [see Nakajima et al., J. Virol 70: 3325-9 (1996); Ogata et al., (1991) supra]. Multiple independent clones from this region were sequenced and the predominant HVR1 sequence in each position was used in the consensus clones. The predominant sequence utilized differs in one position from that determined by others [Inchauspe et al., (1991) supra; Nakajima et al., (1996) supra; Ogata et al., (1991) supra. However, it is highly similar to that of the prototype HCV-H clone, which was derived from liver RNA isolated from an H77-inoculated chimpanzee. Hence, it seemed that this sequence would be tolerated for HCV replication in chimps. As shown below, this sequence was functional but it is likely that many other HVR sequence variations will also be tolerated.</p><p>A second region of the HCV-H sequence, the length and composition of the 3' NTR poly (U/UC) tract, was not determined unambiguously. Sufficient quantities of double-stranded cDNA could not be obtained for direct cloning of this region without resorting to PCR amplification. PCR amplification can contract and possibly expand the length of this homopolymer tract. Thus, clones resulting from this procedure may not reflect the native HCV genome RNA structure. In multiple independent clones derived by PCR amplification, the length of this tract varied from 41 to 133 nucleotides (see Kolykhalov et al., 1996 and Patent Application Serial No. 08/520,678). Hence, two different lengths of poly (U/UC) tract were tested: "short" (75 bases) or "long" (133 bases). The length of the "short" tract is actually about the medium length for all sequences (from different genotypes) reported by us [Kolykhalov et al., (1996) supra] or others [Tanaka et al., (1995) supra; Tanaka et al., (1996) supra; Yamada et al., (1996), supra]. The "long" tract was only recovered in one HCV-H clone (pGEM3Zf(-)HCV-H3'NTR#10); a tract of similar length was recovered in one clone of genotype 4 isolate WD [Kolykhalov et al., (1996) supra]. Such long poly (U/UC) tracts have not yet been reported by others Tanaka et al., (1995) supra; Tanaka et al., (1996) supra; Yamada et al., (1996) supra].</p><p>Variations in 5'-terminal sequences, silent markers, length of 3' NTR poly (U/UC) tracts, and 3' run-off site. Given that additional bases were found at the 5' end of some HCV cDNA clones and the uncertainty about the length of the poly (U/UC) tract, several alternative clones were created. Silent nucleotide substitutions were incorporated in the ORF to serve as markers for identifying which derivatives were functional in later analyses and to demonstrate that replicating virus was in fact recovered from the assembled cDNA clones. Replacing the previously used HpaI site, a BsmI site was created following the 3' end of the HCV cDNA to allow for production of run-off transcripts corresponding to the precise 3' end of HCV genome RNA. Details describing these constructions follow:</p><p>Additional bases at the 5' terminus. A recipient clone containing the most frequent 5' terminal sequence (5'-GCCA . . . -3') called pTET/T7HCVΔBglIII/5'+3'corr. was modified by subcloning a BssHII (479) to KpnI (580) fragment from pTET/HCV5'T7G3'AFL, one of the prototype HCV-H cDNA clones tested in chimpanzees, to create p67/HCVΔBglIII/5'+3'/XhoI-. These clones differ by presence of a XhoI site at position 514 (pTET/T7HCVΔBgIII/5'+3'corr.) or its absence (p67/HCVΔBglII/5'+3'/XhoI-). p67/HCVΔBglIII/5'+3'/XhoI- was then used as the vector for construction of four derivatives with different 5' terminal sequences. These are:</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->__________________________________________________________________________Plasmid             5' sequence of T7 transcript                                 Marker (position)__________________________________________________________________________p70/HCVΔBglII/5'  +  3'/XhoI-/GG               5'-GGCCA...-3'    XhoI- (514)   - p71/HCVΔBglII/5'  +  3'/XhoI-/GAG       5'-GAGCCA...-3'                                       XhoI- (514)   - p72/HCVΔBglII/5'  +  3'/XhoI-/GUG       5'-GUGCCA...-3'                                       XhoI- (514)   - p73/HCVΔBglII/5'  +  3'/XhoI-/GCG       5'-GCGCCA...-3'                                       XhoI- (514)__________________________________________________________________________</pre></p><p>These derivatives were constructed using appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR amplification and their structures verified by sequence analysis.</p><p>Assembly of a clone containing the consensus sequence between KpnI (580) and NotI (9219).

Since the previously used HpaI run off site resulted in transcripts with an additional 3' terminal U residue which might be deleterious, clones were re-engineered so that transcripts terminating at the exact HCV 3' nucleotide could be synthesized. This was accomplished by positioning a BsmI site at an appropriate position downstream from the HCV 3' terminus. Cleavage with BsmI produces a template strand which terminates at the position corresponding to the HCV 3' terminus. Since the H77 consensus sequence contains a BsmI site at position 5934, this site was inactivated with a translationally silent substitution engineered by site-directed mutagenesis.</p><p>The first step in this series of constructions was to inactivate the BsmI site in the HCV H77 cDNA. This clone. called p62/HCVFLcons/Bsm(-) was created in a four fragment ligation which included: (1) annealed synthetic oligos between SacI (5923) and Sau3AI (5942) which contained a silent substitution inactivating the BsmI site (C instead of A at position 5934); (2) NsiI (5282) to SacI (5923) fragment from p61/HCVFLcons; (3) Sau3AI (5942) to Bsu36I (6209) from p6I/HCVFLcons; (4) Bsu36I (6209) and NsiI (5282) digested p61/HCVFLcons. p62/HCVFLcons/Bsm(-) was sequenced completely verifying the structure of the assembled consensus clone, the presence of a silent marker mutation at position 899 (C instead of T), the ablated BsmI site, and a silent marker mutation at position 8054 (see below).</p><p>Intermediate plasmid p65/3'HCVBsm(+)/Not-Mlu, containing the 3' BsmI run off site, was created by the following three fragment ligation: (1) annealed synthetic oligos between Sau3AI (9639) and MluI (9656) containing the BsmI site [5'-tgTcgcattc-3' (SEQ ID NO:21); the nucleotides in bold indicate the BsmI site, the upper case nucleotide corresponds to the 3' terminal base of the HCV genome]; (2) NotI (9219) to Sau3AI (9639) fragment from p62/HCVFLcons/Bsm(-); (3) MluI (9656) to NotI (9219) from p61/HCVFLcons. Note that this clone contains both the internal BsmI site (5934) and the engineered BsmI run-off site.</p><p>The original consensus full-length clone, p61/HCVFLcons, contained a silent substitution in the NS5B coding region (A instead of G at position 8054). This substitution was used as a marker to distinguish between clones containing "short" poly (U/UC) tracts (these clones contain A at position 8054) or "long" poly (U/UC) tracts (with G at position 8054). p90/HCVFLlong pU (SEQ ID NO:5), containing long poly (U/UC) and G at position 8054, was constructed by ligation of four fragments: (1) XbaI (-20) to HindIII (7861) from p62/HCVFLcons/Bsm(-); (2) HindIII (7861) to EcoRI (8205) from library clone AAK#209 (FIG. 9) containing the G residue at position 8054; EcoRI (8205) to NotI (9219) from p62/HCVFLcons/Bsm(-); NotI (9219) to XbaI (-20) from p65/3'HCVBsm(+)/Not-Mlu.</p><p>p91/HCVFLshort pU, a derivative containing the "short" poly (U/UC) tract and the silent marker A at position 8054, was created by ligation of the following fragments: (1) BglI (9398) to NheI (9520) from pGEM3Zf(-)HCV-H3'NTR#8; (2) NheI (9520) to MluI (9597) from p65/3'HCVBsm(+)/Not-Mlu; MluI (9597) to NotI (9219) from p62/HCVFLcons/Bsm(-). Note that numbering for this construction refers to the final p91/HCVFLshort pU sequence.</p><p>To generate the final set of full-length constructs with long poly (U/UC) and additional nucleotides at the 5' terminus, the KpnI (580) to MluI (9656) fragment from p90/HCVFLlong pU was cloned into p70/HCVΔBglII/5'+3'/XhoI-/GG, p7 1 /HCVΔBglIII/5' +3'/XhoI-/GAG, p72/HCVΔBglII/5' +3 '/Xhol-/GUG, and p73/HCVΔBglII/5'+3'/XhoI-/GCG to create p92/HCVFLlong pU/5'GG, p93/HCVFLlong pU/5'GAG, p94/HCVFLlong pU/5'GUG, p95/HCVFLlong pU/5'GCG, respectively.</p><p>To generate the analogous set of full-length constructs with short poly (U/UC), the KpnI (580) to MluI (9597) fragment from p91/HCVFLshort pU was cloned into p70/HCVΔBglII/5' +3'/XhoI-/GG, p71 /HCVΔBglII/5' +3'/Xhol-/GAG, p72/HCVΔBglII/5'+3'/XhoI-/GUG, and p73/HCVΔBglIII/5'+3'/XhoI-/GCG to create p96/HCVFLshort pU/5'GG, p97/HCVFLshort pU/5'GAG, p98/HCVFLshort pU/5'GUG, p99/HCVFLshort pU/5'GCG, respectively.</p><p>The salient features of these 10 clones [5' bases, silent markers, poly (U/UC) length] are summarized in FIG. 11. Plasmids were propagated in E. coli (tet.sup.s SURE strain) and purified plasmid DNAs were prepared by standard methods, including twice banding on CsCI gradients [Ausubel et al., Current protocols in molecular biology. eds. Greene Publishing Associates, New York (1993); Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)].</p><p>Transcription of full-length RNAs. As mentioned above, increasing the UTP concentration to 3 mM in T7 transcription reactions increased the yield of full-length HCV RNAs, by facilitating readthrough of the poly (U/UC) tract. The skewed ratio of UTP (3 mM) to the other rNTPs (1 mM) could lead to increased misincorporation of U residues, in particular late in the transcription reaction when the other NTPs were substantially depleted. This concern was avoided by increasing the concentration of the other three NTPs to 3 mM. Purified plasmid DNAs were digested to completion with BsmI, extracted once with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol [Ausubel et al., (1993) supra; Sambrook et al., (1989) supra]. DNA pellets were washed with EtOH to remove salts and resuspended in RNase-free H.sub.2 O. Transcription reactions (100 μl) contained the following components: 10 μg BsmI-linearized template DNA, 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 16 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM each rNTP, 100 units T7 RNA polymerase, and 0.02 U inorganic pyrophosphatase. After a 1 hour incubation at 37 with greater than 80% full-length RNA as estimated by gel electrophoresis (FIG. 8B).</p><heading>Chimpanzee experiment III</heading><p>Transcripts from the ten consensus clones were used to inoculate two different animals, using essentially the same surgical procedures described above. Protocols were reviewed and approved by the FDA and NIH Animal Studies Committees. Animals were seronegative for all hepatitis viruses, negative for HCV RNA by nested RT-PCR, and had normal baseline levels of liver enzymes. Two different inoculation/transfection protocols were employed. For chimpanzee #1535, the 100 μl transcription reactions were diluted with 400 μl PBS and stored frozen at -80 used for inoculation. These storage conditions were tested and shown to have no observable effect on the integrity of HCV RNA transcripts. Prior to inoculation, samples were thawed and each sample was injected intrahepatically at two sites (˜0.25 ml/site). Injection sites for the 10 clones were distributed in three lobes of the liver. As a positive control for this procedure, chimpanzee #1557 was inoculated similarly with RNA transcripts from two different hepatitis A virus clones. In this case. 80-100 μg of transcribed RNA per clone was inoculated at two sites. A third animal, chimpanzee #1536, was inoculated with smaller amounts of RNA which had been mixed with lipofectin. In this case, the same transcript RNAs from the 10 full-length HCV-H77 clones were treated with DNaseI to remove template DNA and 0.15 μg, 0.5 μg, and 1.5 μg portions were diluted to 50 μl with PBS and stored at -80 inoculation. After thawing, 100 μl PBS containing 9 μg lipofectin (Besthesda Research Laboratory) was added to each sample, mixed, and injected into a single site. Hence, each clone/transcript preparation with different RNA/lipofectin ratios was injected at three separate sites.</p><p>Serum samples and liver biopsies were taken pre-inoculation and at weekly intervals thereafter. For nearly two months post-inoculation, samples have been assayed for liver enzymes (ALT, ICD, GGTP) hepatitis virus serology, and viremia by quantitative competitive RT-PCR [Kolykhalov et al., (1996) supra].</p><p>Evidence for successful initiation of infection and replication.

At week 10, a second peak of liver enzymes was observed. HCV RNA titers were below our detection limit pre-inoculation (&amp;lt;10.sup.2), increased to 10.sup.5 ml by week 1, and continued to climb steadily reaching 2 week 5. This represents a 20-fold increase relative to week 1.</p><p>Chimp #1536 showed less evidence of early liver damage with only a minor peak in the ICD level at week 2 and fluctuating values thereafter. However, highly elevated levels of enzymes were observed in weeks 10 and 11. The animal also became HCV-seropositive on weeks 10 and 11. On week 1, the HCV RNA titer was 10.sup.4 /ml and has climbed to 6 by week 6.

HAV-specific immunoreactivity increased sharply on week 5 and continued at high levels thereafter. These results show clear evidence of HAV infection and validate the inoculation method used for chimpanzee #1535.</p><p>All of the samples analyzed for HCV RNA were also assayed for the presence of residual template DNA by omitting the enzyme in the reverse transcription step. No products were obtained, demonstrating that the signals detected in the quantitative competitive PCR assay were due to RNA (FIG. 12). In addition, the HCV RNA containing material in these samples was resistant to RNase digestion under the same conditions that completely degraded naked competitor RNA mixed with serum being analyzed (FIG. 13). These are the expected results if the RNAs are packaged into enveloped RNase-resistant virus particles, as opposed to residual inoculated RNA. Moreover, the total amount of transcript RNA used for inoculation was ˜3000 μg for chimpanzee #1535 and only ˜22 μg for chimpanzee #1536. In spite of being inoculated with ˜150-fold less RNA, chimpanzee #1536 showed higher levels of viremia than chimpanzee #1535. Thus the level of viremia does not correlate with input RNA, which is again indicative of virus amplification and spread. Finally, in the previous negative experiment using the non-consensus combinatorial library clones and the ΔGDD negative control (Example 3), 1000-2000 μg of HCV-specific RNA were inoculated per animal using similar procedures. No HCV RNA was detected at week 1 or thereafter, again suggesting that signal observed here is due to authentic virus replication and release into the serum.</p><p>Proof that the infections observed in these animals stemmed from the inoculated transcript RNA was obtained by restriction enzyme and sequence analysis of recovered virus for the presence of engineered markers. Two silent mutations marked all of the transfected RNAs. These were the substitution at position 899 (C instead of T) and the substitution at position 5936 (C instead of A) ablating the internal BsmI site (5934). For the nucleotide 899 marker, the region between 466 to 950 was amplified by nested RT-PCR, sequenced directly, and shown to have the expected H77 sequence including the silent C (instead of T) marker at position 899. The region from 5801 to 6257 was also amplified by nested RT-PCR and shown to be resistant to digestion with BsmI. The expected digestion products were obtained, however, for four other enzymes cleaving in this region [SstI (5923); BspHI (5944); Bsu36I (6209); RsaI (6244)] of the H77 cDNA sequence. These analyses were conducted for both chimpanzee #1535 (week 5) and chimpanzee #1536 (week 6).</p><p>The pathogenesis profiles for the RNA-inoculated animals are reminiscent of those obtained in previous experiments in which chimpanzees were inoculated with the H77 material or other HCV-containing samples. The course of this disease in chimpanzees, like man, is highly variable with respect to the extent of liver damage, progression to chronicity, level of viremia, and timing of seroconversion.</p><p>Identification of functional "infectious" clones by evaluating silent markers present in virus recoveredfrom infected animals. As detailed above, additional silent markers were incorporated in order to help identify the 5' terminal sequence(s) and the length(s) of poly (U/UC) tract which were required or preferred for initiating infection.</p><p>Transcripts containing a single G (5'-GCCA . . . -3') were distinguished from those with additional 5' residues by the presence of the XhoI (514) silent marker in the C protein coding region. The region containing this marker was amplified by RT-PCR under conditions that ensured that a representative number of independent cDNAs were analyzed (greater than 50 in this case). The resulting products were analyzed for digestion with either XhoI or as a control, AccI, an enzyme which should digest this fragment for all input clones. For chimpanzee #1535 (week 3 sample), the fraction of the products digested with XhoI paralleled the input inoculum: approximately 20% was digested with XhoI (both 4 U and 30 U); 80% was resistant to digestion (values were determined by scanning ethidium bromide-stained digestion patterns with an IC.sub.1000 Imaging System). Complete digestion was observed for AccI. In the week 4 sample analyzed for chimpanzee #1536, 55% was digested with XhoI; 45% was resistant to digestion. Again, complete digestion was observed for AccI. Thus, in the second animal an advantage was observed for transcripts with only a single G (5'-GCCA . . . -3'). Although it is not possible to draw firm quantitative conclusions from these data regarding possible differences in specific infectivity, the results clearly demonstrate that the transcripts without additional nucleotides are infectious (clones p90/HCVFLlong pU and p91/HCVFLshort pU). Furthermore, transcripts with additional nucleotides can also initiate infection, although our analysis thus far does not allow us to distinguish among the various clones.</p><p>Transcripts containing "short" or "long" poly (U/UC) tracts were distinguished by 'the silent marker at position 8054 of the NS5B coding region. The region between 7955 and 8088 was amplified by RT-PCR, using enough cDNA to ensure the amplification of greater than 100 independent cDNA molecules, and molecularly cloned. Sequences of ten and nine independent clones were determined for chimpanzee #1535 (week 3) and chimpanzee #1536 (week 4), respectively. Nine of ten clones (90%) for chimpanzee #1535 contained the G at position 8054, indicative of the "long" poly (U/UC) tract. Six of nine clones (66%) for chimpanzee #1536 contained the G at position 8054, indicative of the "long" poly (U/UC) tract. The results demonstrate that transcripts containing either "short" or "long" poly (U/UC) tracts are infectious but that the "long" poly (U/UC) tract appears to be preferred. We can not, however, rule out the possibility that this effect is due to deleterious effects of the marker mutation at 8054. These additional analyses provide further confirmation that the viremia observed in these animals was initiated by transcripts derived from our full-length clones.</p><p>The functional genotype la cDNA clones described in this Example, or functional clones for other HCV genotypes (constructed and verified using similar methods), have a variety of applications for development of (i) more effective HCV therapies; (ii) HCV vaccines; (iii) HCV diagnostics; and (iv) HCV-based gene expression vectors.</p><heading>Example 5</heading><p>Productive HCV Infection of a Hepatocyte Line</p><p>The EcoRI-BstBI fragment from pCEN was cloned into the unique SfiI site of p90/HCVFLlong pU. Prior to ligation, protruding termini were blunt ended using T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTPs. The EcoRI-BstBI fragment from pCEN contains the EMCV IRES element followed by the neomycin-resistance (NEO) coding region. This IRES NEO cassette is essentially identical to that described in Ghattas et al. [Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:5848 (1991)]. A clone containing this cassette in the correct orientation (positive-sense with respect to HCV genome RNA) was identified by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes.</p><p>EMCV IRES NEO cassette was inserted into the SfiI site in the 3' NTR of p90/HCVFL long pU. This transcribed RNA was used to transfect a human hepatocyte cell line, which was then selected for neomycin resistance using G418. Most cells died, but a G418 population grew up over the course of a few months. Remarkably, HCV RNA appears to be still present in these cells at a copy number of ˜1000 RNA molecules per cell. It is believed that the neomycin resistance is mediated by HCV RNA because there is no evidence for integration of contaminating template DNA in the genome of these cells.</p><p>The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.
