In addition, from a viewpoint of achieving further preferable formability, the weight-averaged molecular weight of the polymer is preferably in the range of 3000 to 6000 in terms of polystyrene. The weight-averaged molecular weight is measured, for example, by a gel permeation chromatography (GPC). For the present invention, the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> weight-averaged molecular weight is measured under conditions described below by using the gel permeation chromatography (GPC: HLC-8120 GPC SC-8020 manufactured by TOSOH CORPORATION). A solvent (tetrahydrofuran) is poured at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min at 40°C, a tetrahydrofuran sample solution having a concentration of 0.2 g/20 ml is injected as a sample weight of 3 mg, and the measurement is carried out by using IR detector. For the measurement of the weight-averaged molecular weight of the sample, selected is a measurement condition that the molecular weight of the sample is within the range that a logarithm of the molecular weight and a count number on a calibration curve prepared by various kinds of a mono-dispersed polystyrene standard sample are linear. The reliability of the measurement result can be confirmed by a NBS706 polystyrene standard sample prepared by the aforementioned measurement conditions having the weight-averaged molecular weight of Mw = 28.8 × 10<sup>4</sup>. As a column of the GPC, TSK-GEL and GMH (manufactured by TOSOH Corporation) satisfying the aforementioned conditions are used.
