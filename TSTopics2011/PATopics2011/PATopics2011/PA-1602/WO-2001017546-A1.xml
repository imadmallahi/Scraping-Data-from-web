Immunosuppressive medications play a large part of the management of many pediatric illnesses. Cyclosporine is the primary tool used to prevent rejection following solid organ and bone marrow transplantation; the drug helped revolutionize transplantation by improving transplant survival, reducing hospitalization, and reducing patient morbidity. It has been estimated that cyclosporine is given to more than 90% of children who have received a kidney transplant in the United States. Cyclosporine also has been effective in various other autoimmune conditions such as uveitis, psoriasis, type I diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, certain nephropathies, refractory</p><p num="p0007">Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, biliary cirrhosis, aplastic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, and dermatomyositis.</p><p num="p0008">Cyclosporine is in clinical use worldwide under the trade names SANDIMMUNE<sup>®</sup> (Novartis), NEORAL<sup>®</sup> (Novartis), and SANGCYA<sup>®</sup> (SangStat). SANDIMMUNE<sup>®</sup>, introduced in 1983, suffered from poor and widely variable absorption rates. This prompted development of a second generation cyclosporine formulation, NEORAL<sup>®</sup>, which is a microemulsion formulation having better absorption than SANDIMMUNE<sup>®</sup>- both in quantity and consistency. Since 1995, when NEORAL<sup>®</sup> was introduced, about 70% of patients have switched from SANDIMMUNE<sup>®</sup> to NEORAL<sup>®</sup>. indicating the severity of poor and inconsistent absorption of cyclosporine. SANGCYA<sup>®</sup>, which is a modified oral solution bioequivalent to NEORAL<sup>®</sup>, was introduced in 1998. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 Cyclosporine is administered orally and intravenously (IV). After oral administration, roughly 20 to 50% is absorbed, although absorption is highly variable. First-pass metabolism, mode of administration, and drug interactions all affect cyclosporine absorption. Food decreases the absorption of NEORAL<sup>®</sup> and SANGCYA<sup>®</sup>. Cyclosporine is extremely hydrophobic. The IV formulation contains 33% alcohol and a castor oil vehicle to solubilize the drug, which is believed to account for occasionally severe hypersensitivity reactions. Oral preparations can contain corn, castor or olive oil and ethanol, but in lower concentrations. The dose normalized area under the curve (AUC) is 23% greater for NEORAL<sup>®</sup> or SANGCYA<sup>®</sup> as compared to SANDIMMUNE<sup>®</sup> in renal transplant, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis patients, and</p><p num="p0009">50% greater in liver transplant patients. Data for cardiac transplant patients is limited, but similar increases have been noted. Increases in peak blood cyclosporine concentrations (NEORAL<sup>®</sup> and SANGCYA<sup>®</sup> related to SANDIMMUNE<sup>®</sup> ) range from 40 to 106% for renal transplant patients and 90% for liver transplant patients. While NEORAL<sup>®</sup> and SANGCYA<sup>®</sup> are an improvement over</p><p num="p0010">SANDIMMUNE<sup>®</sup>, the conventional cyclosporine formulations suffer from poor bioavailabihty because, among other things, cyclosporine is poorly water soluble. Moreover, currently marketed cyclosporine formulations are known to have disadvantageous "intersubject variability," i.e., it has been found that, given the same dosage amount, actual blood levels of cyclosporine vary significantly from patient to patient. See Physicians ' Desk Reference ( 1998) at 1882 et seq. This represents an important shortcoming of these drugs. Specifically, because cyclosporine has a narrow therapeutic index (a narrow range between an effective dosage and a harmful dosage), the inability to predict drug absorption requires that physicians closely monitor each patient to establish baseline absorption levels. Such monitoring is expensive and time consuming. In addition, the poor absorption and patient variability of known cyclosporine formulations can make dosage formulation difficult. Proper dosage formulation for cyclosporine is critical because the drug is a general immunosuppressive. Therefore, the drug can result in an increased susceptibility to infection. Too much drug can result in uncontrolled infection while too little can result in organ rejection. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 One drug delivery method that can result in increasing the bioavailabihty, increasing the absorption rate, quantity, and consistency, and decreasing the toxicity of a drug is formulation of the drug into a nanoparticulate composition. Nanoparticulate compositions, first described in U.S. Patent No. 5,145,684 ("the '684 patent" ), are particles consisting of a poorly soluble crystalline therapeutic or diagnostic agent onto which are adsorbed a non-crosslinked surface stabilizer. Nanoparticulate compositions comprising cyclosporine are not described by the '684 patent. Nanoparticulate compositions containing crystalline, but not amorphous, cyclosporine are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,494,683 and 5,399,363. Conventional large particle sized amorphous cyclosporine compositions are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,389,382 ("the '382 patent") and 5,827,822 ("the '822 patent" ). These disclosures suffer from various deficiencies. For example, the '382 patent describes hydrosols of cyclosporine in an intravenous applicable, stabilized, pharmaceutically acceptable form, which is suspended or dry. The hydrosol formulations are obtained by controlled precipitation methods. Such methods are disadvantageous in that they result in solid dose formulations having a low drug to surface stabilizer ratio, and liquid dispersion formulations having a low solid content. This is because controlled precipitation methods require an excess amount of surface stabilizer and water to produce small-sized precipitated particles. The excess of surface stabilizer produces solid dose compositions having a large quantity of surface stabilizer and a small quantity of drug. and the excess of water produces a liquid dispersion formulation having a low solids content and, therefore, a low drug content.</p><p num="p0011">A high drug content for a solid dose or liquid dispersion formulation is preferred because it produces a more concentrated dosage formulation. Concentrated dosage forms of cyclosporine are particularly desirable because the dosage for this drug is relatively high, i.e., about 100 mg a day or more. A dosage formulation having a low drug content, but requiring a high daily dosage, results in either a large pill, capsule, or quantity of fluid, or multiple doses of such formulations, to be administered to the patient. In contrast, a concentrated dosage form allows minimization of the size of the orally administered pill or capsule or number of daily administrations. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 The '822 patent is directed to aqueous suspension formulations of amorphous cyclosporin A containing lower alkanols as solubilizing agents and a polyoxyalkylene surfactant. The addition of alcohol solubilizing agents is frequently undesirable because they can an trigger an allergic response in a patient. Such solubilizing agents are often required for prior art cyclosporine compositions to increase the solubility of the cyclosporine. A drug must be absorbed by a patient prior to taking effect. Thus, often pharmaceutical formulations of highly insoluble drugs additionally contain solubilizing agents to aid in absorption of the drug following administration.</p> <p num="p0012">There remains a need in the art for cyclosporine formulations that can be delivered in high dosage formulations, that exhibit consistent and effective absorption, that have decreased toxicity as compared to known cyclosporine formulations, and which do not require the presence of alcohol solubilizing agents. The present invention satisfies these needs.</p><p num="p0013">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0014">The present invention is directed to nanoparticulate compositions of amorphous cyclosporine and, adsorbed to the surface of the cyclosporine, at least one non-crosslinked surface stabilizer.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0021">The present invention is directed to compositions comprising nanoparticulate amorphous cyclosporine, or a mixture of amorphous and crystalline cyclosporine, and methods of making and using such nanoparticulate compositions. As used herein, singular terms are used for simplicity of expression only and are not intended to limit the invention or aspects of the invention to singular embodiments. Thus, the description of, for example, "a surface stabilizer" is meant to describe "one or more" surface stabilizers unless explicitly indicated otherwise. Prior to the present invention, it was known that crystalline drugs could be formulated into nanoparticulate compositions, as taught by the '684 patent. In such compositions, a surface stabilizer adsorbs to the crystalline surface of the drug and acts as a steric barrier to other drug particles to prevent agglomeration. This results in a stable nanoparticulate composition, in which the particle size of the composition does not significantly increase over time via solubilization and recrystallization or agglomeration. Because the surface stabilizer adsorbs to the surface of the crystalline drug, and does not chemically interact with the drug, it was thought that amoφhous drugs could not be utilized in nanoparticulate compositions described by the '684 patent. Amoφhous drugs do not have an intermolecular lattice structure, which is characteristic of the crystalline solid state. Suφrisingly, it was discovered that amoφhous cyclosporine can be incoφorated into a nanoparticulate composition.</p><p num="p0022">An amoφhous compound has a higher energy level than a crystalline compound. Because of this, an amoφhous compound is generally unstable, as in nature the compound prefers to convert to the lower energy crystalline state. Because amoφhous compounds have a higher energy level than crystalline compounds, it is preferable that a drug be in an amoφhous state. The amoφhous state is less stable than the crystalline state; therefore, a solid will be more soluble in the amoφhous state than in the crystalline state. Improved solubility will lead to rapid and more complete dissolution, and in the case of a poorly soluble drug substance, improved bioavailabihty.</p><p num="p0023">A. Compositions 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 The compositions of the invention comprise nanoparticulate amoφhous cyclosporine, or a mixture of amorphous and crystalline cyclosporine. having one or more surface stabilizers adsorbed to the surface of the cyclosporine. Surface stabilizers useful herein physically adhere to the surface of the nanoparticulate cyclosporine but do not chemically react with the cyclosporine itself. Individually adsorbed molecules of the surface stabilizer are essentially free of intermolecular crosslinkages.</p><p num="p0024">The present invention also includes nanoparticulate compositions formulated into compositions together with one or more non-toxic physiologically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, or vehicles, collectively referred to as earners, for parenteral injection, for oral administration, for rectal or topical administration, or the like. The present invention further includes nanoparticulate compositions in solid dose formulations and liquid dispersion formulations. 1. Cyclosporine</p><p num="p0025">The cyclosporins comprise a class of cyclic non-polar oligopeptides having valuable immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-parasitic activity. The first of the cyclosporins to be isolated and what has been termed the "parent" compound of the class is the naturally occurring fungal metabolite referred to simply as "cyclosporine" or as "cyclosporin A."</p><p num="p0026">Since the discovery of cyclosporin A, a wide variety of naturally occuning cyclosporins have been isolated and identified and other non-naturally occurring cyclosporins have been prepared by synthetic means or via modified culture techniques. Such compounds are known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,389,382 and in The Merck Index (12<sup>th</sup> ed. 1996) at 464-465. As used herein, the term cyclosporine is meant to include both cyclosporin A and other cyclosporins. such as cyclosporins B through I and synthetic analogues thereof. The preferred cyclosporin used herein is cyclosporin A.</p><p num="p0027">The cyclosporine compositions of the present invention are either partiall} or predominantly amorphous in nature. This is so even though the starting cyclosporine compound used to obtain the nanoparticulate compositions may be predominantly crystalline in nature. The term "amorphous" is a term with a recognized meaning in the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
chemical arts and describes a structure that is non-crystalline, i.e., a structure that lacks an intermolecular lattice structure. Whether the nanoparticulate composition is in a crystalline or amorphous state can be determined, for example, by X-ray powder diffraction patterns or other methods known to the skilled artisan.</p><p num="p0028">2.

Methods of Making Nanoparticulate Formulations</p><p num="p0038">Exemplary methods of making nanoparticulate compositions are described in the '684 patent. The optimal effective average particle size of the invention can be obtained by controlling the process of particle size reduction, such as by controlling the milling time and the amount of surface stabilizer added. Particle growth and particle aggregation can also be minimized by milling the composition under colder temperatures and by storing the final composition at colder temperatures.</p><p num="p0039">Milling to obtain a nanoparticulate composition comprises dispersing cyclosporine particles in a liquid dispersion medium, followed by applying mechanical means in the presence of grinding media to reduce the particle size of the cyclosporine to the desired effective average particle size. The cyclosporine particles can be reduced in size in the presence of one or more surface stabilizers. Alternatively, the cyclosporine particles can be contacted with one or more surface stabilizers after attrition. Other compounds, such as a diluent, can be added to the cyclosporine/surface stabilizer composition during the size reduction process. Dispersions can be manufactured continuously or in a batch mode. The resultant nanoparticulate cyclosporine dispersion can be utilized in solid or liquid dosage formulations. Exemplary useful mills include low

When given NEORAL<sup>®</sup>, five of the six subjects had detectable plasma concentrations (ranging from 66.50 to 393.04 ng/mL/hr) at 15 minutes post-dosing, but one dog (No. 408/f/l) had no detectable blood levels even thirty minutes after receiving the drug (Table 3).</p><p num="p0132">The results also show that the nanoparticulate amoφhous cyclosporine formulation is more rapidly absorbed that the conventional NEORAL<sup>®</sup>formulation. As seen in Table 2, when the dogs were administered nanoparticulate cyclosporine the peak plasma concentrations were all reached in approximately 1 hour or less. When given NEORAL®, peak plasma levels were reached in approximately 1.5 hours for 5 of the six dogs and in approximately 2 hours for dog no. 408/f/l (Table 3). These results demonstrate the superior consistency of bioavailabihty and more rapid absoφtion among different subjects of the inventive compositions over a conventional cyclosporine formulation, such as NEORAL<sup>®</sup>.</p><p num="p0133">* * * * It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the methods and compositions of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
