Specifically, the invention relates to compositions and methods for enhancing expression of proteins in plant plastids.</p><p num="p0006">Background</p><p num="p0007">The plastids of higher plants are an attractive target for genetic engineering. Plant plastids (chloroplasts, amyloplasts, elaioplasts, etioplasts, chromoplasts, etc.) are the major biosynthetic centers that, in addition to photosynthesis, are responsible for production of industrially important compounds such as amino acids, complex carbohydrates, fatty acids, and pigments. Plastids are derived from a common precursor known as a proplastid and thus the plastids present in a given plant species all have the same genetic content. Plant cells contain 500-10,000 copies of a small 120-160 kilobase circular genome, each molecule of which has a large (approximately 25kb) inverted repeat. Thus, it is possible to engineer plant cells to contain up to 20,000 copies of a particular gene of interest which potentially can result in very high levels of foreign gene expression. In addition, plastids of most plants are maternally inherited. Consequently, unlike heterologous genes expressed in the nucleus, heterologous genes expressed in plastids are not pollen disseminated, therefore, a trait introduced into a plant plastid will not be transmitted to wild-type relatives.</p><p num="p0008">There remains a need for improved regulatory elements for expression of genes in a plant plastid. To date, the expression signals used routinely for plastid transgene expression derive from endogenous plastid genes. The plastid expression signals are typically derived from promoter regions of highly expressed plastid genes such as the promoter regions from the 16S ribosomal RNA operon (Prrn), psbA gene (PpsbA) or the rbcL gene (PrbcL). The psbA and rbcL genes are highly transcribed, but their translation is 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
controlled by tissue-specific and light-regulated factors which limits their usefulness. In the case of Prra, a synthetic ribosome binding site (RBS) patterned after the plastid rbcL gene leader has been typically used to direct translation. However, this Prra/RBS is translated inefficiently due to poor ribosome binding. Plastids of higher plants present an attractive target for genetic engineering. As mentioned above, plastids of higher plants are maternally inherited. This offers an advantage for genetic engineering of plants for tolerance or resistance to natural or chemical conditions, such as herbicide tolerance, as these traits will not be transmitted to wild-type relatives. In addition, the high level of foreign gene expression is attractive for engineered traits such as the production of pharmaceutically important proteins.</p><p num="p0009">Expression of nucleic acid sequences encoding for enzymes providing for herbicide tolerance as well as pharmaceutical proteins from plant plastid genome offers an attractive alternative to expression from the plant nuclear genome.</p><p num="p0010">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p><p num="p0011">The present invention provides nucleic acid sequences useful in enhancing expression of a wide variety of genes, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, in plant plastids. Furthermore, plastid expression constructs are provided which are useful for genetic engineering of plant cells and which provide for enhanced expression of the EPSP synthase proteins or the hGH protein in plant cell plastids. The transformed plastids should be metabolically active plastids, and are preferably maintained at a high copy number in the plant tissue of interest, most preferably the chloroplasts found in green plant tissues, such as leaves or cotyledons. The plastid expression constructs for use in this invention generally include a plastid promoter region capable of providing for enhanced expression of a DNA sequence, a DNA sequence encoding an EPSPS protein or human growth hormone (hGH), and a transcription termination region capable of terminating transcription in a plant plastid. The plastid promoter region of the present invention is preferably linked to a ribosome binding site which provides for enhanced translation of mRNA transcripts in a plant plastid.</p><p num="p0012">The plastid expression construct of this invention is preferably linked to a construct having a DNA sequence encoding a selectable marker which can be expressed in a plant

Such methods generally involve the use of fusion proteins having an N-terminus sequence which is recognized by an endogenous protease. In particular, a DNA sequence encoding a cleavable ubiquitin peptide is fused to a DNA sequence encoding a protein of interest. After expression of the fusion protein in the plastid, an endogenous protease acts on the fusion to cleave off the ubiquitin portion of the protein.</p><p num="p0029">Also of interest in the present invention is the use of the plastid expression constructs to direct the high level transcription and translation (expression) of nucleic acid sequences. Such plastid expression constructs find use in directing the high level expression of DNA sequences encoding for enzymes involved in herbicide tolerance or encoding for the production of pharmaceutical proteins.</p><p num="p0030">Of more particular interest in the present invention is the use of the plastid expression constructs to direct the high level translation of transcribed messenger RNA. DNA sequence and biochemical data reveal a similarity of the plastid organelle's transcriptional and translational machineries and initiation signals to those found in prokaryotic systems. In fact, plastid derived promoter sequences have been reported to direct expression of reporter genes in prokaryotic cells. In addition, plastid genes are often organized into polycistronic operons as they are in prokaryotes. Despite the apparent similarities between plastids and prokaryotes, there exist fundamental differences in the methods used to control gene expression in plastids and prokaryotes. As opposed to the transcriptional control mechanisms typically observed in prokaryotes, plastid gene expression is controlled predominantly at the level of translation and mRNA stability by trans-acting nuclear encoded proteins. Translation is a multi-stage process which first involves the binding of messenger</p><p num="p0031">RNA (mRNA) to ribosomes. Beginning at the translation start codon, the mRNA codons are read sequentially as the ribosomes move along the mRNA molecule. The specified 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
amino acids are then sequentially added to the growing polypeptide chain to yield the protein or polypeptide encoded in the mRNA.</p><p num="p0032">As mentioned, the first step in the translation process is the binding of the mRNA molecule to the ribosome. The nature of this interaction (i.e. binding) has been only partially elucidated. Analysis of RNase-resistant oligonucleotides isolated from bacterial translation initiation complexes indicate that a RNA fragment approximately 30 to 40 nucleotides in length comprises the initial ribosome binding site (RBS). Thus, a RBS is hereinafter understood to comprise a sequence of mRNA surrounding the translation start codon which is responsible for the binding of the ribosome and for initiation of translation. Recently, ribosome binding sites have been identified which are capable of directing translation in a prokaryotes. For example, a ribosome binding site derived from the T7 bacteriophage gene 10 leader, G10L (USPN 5,232,840, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference), has been identified which enhances expression of nucleic acid sequences in prokaryotes. Herbicides such as N-phosphonomethylglycine, halogenated hydroxybenzonitriles, and norflurazon have been the subject of a large amount of investigation.</p><p num="p0033">N-phosphonomethylglycine, commonly referred to as glyphosate, inhibits the shikimic acid pathway which leads to the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds including amino acids, plant hormones and vitamins. Specifically, glyphosate curbs the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) and 3-phosphoshikimic acid to 5-enolpyruvyl-3- phosphoshikimic acid by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (hereinafter referred to as EPSP synthase or EPSPS).</p><p num="p0034">Glyphosate tolerant plants have been produced by transformation of various EPSP synthase genes into the nuclear genome of a plant. A gene for EPSP synthase has been cloned from Agrobacterium tumefaciens sp strain CP4 (USPN 5,633,435) and confers a high level of glyphosate tolerance in plants. Furthermore, high levels of glyphosate tolerance has been achieved in a number of crop plants by fusing EPSPS to a chloroplast transit peptide (CTP) for targeted expression in plastids. In addition, variants of the wild- type EPSPS enzyme have been isolated which are glyphosate tolerant as a result of alterations in the EPSPS amino acid coding sequence (Kishore and Shah, Ann. Rev.</p><p num="p0035">Biochem. (1988) 57:627-663; Shulze et si., Arch. Microbiol. (1984) 137: 121-123; Kishore et al., Fed. Proc. (1986) 45: 1506). These variants typically have a higher K, for glyphosate than the wild-type EPSPS enzyme which confers the glyphosate tolerant phenotype, but 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
these variants are also characterized by a high K<sub>m</sub> for PEP which makes the enzyme kinetically less efficient (Kishore and Shah, Ann. Rev. Biochem. (1988) 57:627-663; Sost et al., FEBSLett. (1984) 173: 238-241; Shulze et al., Arch. Microbiol (1984) 137:121- 123; Kishore et al., Fed. Proc. (1986) 45: 1506; Sost and Amrhein, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. (1990) 282: 433-436).</p><p num="p0036">In addition to engineering plants for glyphosate tolerance, plants have also been engineered to tolerate other classes of herbicides such as halogenated hydroxybenzonitriles, and norflurazon using nucleic acid sequences expressed in the nucleus. Halogenated hydroxybenzonitriles, such as Bromoxynil, are suggested to act herbicidally by inhibiting the quinone-binding protein complex of photosystem II, inhibiting electron transfer (Van Rensen (1982) Physiol. Plant 54:515-520,and Sanders and Pallett (1986) Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 26: 116-122). Herbicides such as norflurazon inhibit the production of carotenoids. Plants which are resistant to Bromoxynil have been produced by expressing DNA sequences encoding for enzymes capable of detoxifying Bromoxynil (nitrilases) in the plant cell nucleus. DNA sequences encoding for such nitrilases have been cloned from bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and used to construct vectors to direct the expression of the DNA sequence in plant cell nucleus (USPN 4,810,648, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference).</p><p num="p0037">Plants which are resistant to Norflurazon have been engineered by expressing nucleic acid sequences which encode for enzymes in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plant cell nuclei. For example, expressing a phytoene desaturase from Erwinia uredovora provides tolerance to norflurazon. While plants transformed to express nucleic acid sequences encoding for such enzymes from the nuclear genome have found utility in engineering herbicide tolerant plants, it would be increasingly beneficial to obtain herbicide tolerant plants via plastidial expression.</p><p num="p0038">In the examples provided herein, DNA sequences encoding for enzymes involved in herbicide tolerance are used in constructs to direct the expression of the sequences from the plant plastid. DNA sequences encoding for 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), bromoxynil nitrilase (Bxn), phytoene desaturase (crtl (Misawa et al, (1993) Plant Journal 4:833-840, and (1994) Plant Jour 6:481-489), and acetohydroxyacid

Acids Res. 18:2188-2193)) are used in the expression constructs of the present invention to direct the expression of said herbicide tolerance nucleotide sequences from the plant plastid.</p><p num="p0039">Transplastomic tobacco plants are identified which are homoplasmic for the DNA sequences encoding the herbicide tolerance genes. Homoplasmic plants demonstrate a high level of protein expression from the plastid. Furthermore, homoplasmic plants demonstrate a high level of tolerance for the respective herbicide. For example, as described in more detail in the example below, plants transformed to express EPSPS from the plastid demonstrate a high level of tolerance for the herbicide glyphosate. In addition, homoplasmic tobacco lines expressing nitrilase or phytoene desaturase demonstrate high levels of tolerance for the herbicides bromoxynil and norflurazon, respectively.</p><p num="p0040">An artisan skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains will recognize that additional sequences may be employed to in the plastid expression constructs of the instant invention to produce herbicide tolerant plants. Other nucleic acid sequence which may find use in the plastid expression constructs herbicide tolerant plants include the bar gene for tolerance to glufosinate (DeBlock, et al. (1987) EMBO J. 6:2513-2519).</p><p num="p0041">Furthermore, additional glyphosate tolerance genes may be employed in the constructs of the present invention. Additional glyphosate tolerant EPSPS genes are described in U.S. Patent Number 5,627,061, Padgette et al. (1996) Herbicide Resistant Crops, Lewis Publishers, 53-85, and in Penaloza- Vazquez, et al. (1995) Plant Cell Reports 14:482-487, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="p0042">It should be noted that the herbicide tolerance constructs of the present invention may also include sequences encoding genes involved in other stress tolerance genes, for example insect or disease resistance/tolerance genes. As described in more detail in the examples that follow, plastid expression constructs are used to regenerate plants which are resistant to the herbicide Buctril, and which also express the Bacillus thuringensis cry 1 Ac protein.</p><p num="p0043">In addition, the plastid expression constructs also find use in directing the production of human biological proteins (pharmaceutical proteins) from the plant plastid. As set forth in detail in the examples, constructs are provided for expression of aprotinin and human growth hormone in the plant plastid. Other sequences which may find use in the expression constructs of the present invention for the production of human biologies include sequences encoding for insulin or insulin precursors. However, the skilled artisan 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
will recognize that many nucleotide sequences encoding for human biologies may be employed in the constructs of the present invention to direct their expression from a plant plastid such as those described in Goodman and Gelman (1990) Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Pergaman Press, 8 Edition, Sections 14 and 15. As, it is contemplated that any protein for which the nucleotide sequence has been identified can be used in the constructs of the present invention.</p><p num="p0044">The present invention also provides methods for producing a pharmaceutical protein with a non-methionine N-terminus in a plant plastid. In general, the methods comprise expressing a fusion protein including a ubiquitin gene fused to a protein of interest in a plastid. The ubiquitin gene is obtained from a natural source and cloned into an appropriate vector, as described in WO 88/02406, supra, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, or it is synthesized chemically, using, e.g., the method described by Ecker et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262:3524-3527 (1987) and Ecker et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262: 14213-14221 (1987), the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. The ubiquitin fusion proteins are recognized by ubiquitin protease, contrary to previous reports (Vierstra (1996) Plant Mol. Biol. 32:275-302), which cleaves immediately downstream of the carboxy terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin. This property has allowed production of recombinant proteins containing N-terminal residues other than methionine (Baker (1996) Current Opin. Biotech. 7:541-546). Additional methods for the production of pharmaceutical proteins with a non- methionine N-terminus in a plant plastid are also provided. As described more fully in the Examples below, constructs are prepared to direct the production of a methionine-hGH (M-hGH) in a plant cell plastid. The constructs generally comprise a transcriptional initiation region and a DNA sequence encoding hGH. Surprisingly, N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the extracted hGH produced in transplastomic plants reveals that the N- terminal methionine is cleaved from the mature hGH protein, producing hGH with an alanine N-terminus (A-hGH). This result indicates the interaction of the expressed hGH with a methionine amino peptidase (MAP) in the plant cell. While it is anticipated that any amino acid may follow in the N-terminal methionine, the second amino acid is preferably selected from the group consisting of alanine, cysteine, glycine, proline, serine, threonine, and valine.</p><p num="p0045">As described in more detail below, nucleic acid sequences encoding for the human growth hormone (hGH) are employed in plastid expression constructs of the present 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
invention. Further, transplastomic tobacco plants containing such constructs demonstrate a high level of expression of hGH. In addition, the hGH protein expressed from the plant plastid exhibits characteristics of proper processing as well as proper protein folding.</p><p num="p0046">Human growth hormone (hGH) participates in much of the regulation of normal human growth and development. This 22,000 dalton pituitary hormone exhibits a multitude of biological effects including linear growth (somatogenesis), lactation, activation of macrophages, insulin-like and diabetogenic effects among others (Chawla, Ann. Rev. Med.(X9%2&gt;) 34:519; Edwards, et al, Science (1988) 239:769; Thorner et al, J. Clin. Invest. (1988) 81 :745). hGH is a member of a family of homologous hormones that include placental lactogens, prolactins, and other genetic and species variants or growth hormone (Nicoll, et al, Endocrine Review s(X9 6) 1: 169). hGH is unusual among these in that it exhibits broad species specificity and binds to either the cloned somatogenic (Leung, et al, Nature (1987) 33:537) or prolactin receptor (Boutin, et al, Cell (1988) 53:69). The primary use of hGH is in the treatment of hypopituitary dwarfism in children. Additional indications are in treatment of Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure, HIV wasting syndrome and the treatment of the elderly and critically ill (Tritos,et al. (1998) Am. J. Med. 105:44-57).</p><p num="p0047">As produced in the pituitary gland, hGH enters the secretory system, coincident with removal of its signal peptide and formation of two disulfide bonds (Chawla, et al. (1983) supra). In the pituitary gland, removal of the signal peptide from hGH (also referred to as human somatotropin or hST) during secretion leaves phenylalanine as the N- terminal amino acid (Chawla, et al. (1983) Annu. Rev. Med. 34:519-547). As normal translation in plastids initiates at methionine, a ubiquitin-hGH fusion was designed to yield a phenylalanine N-terminus (F-hGH) in the final hGH product. Surprisingly, although ubiquitin protease was previously reported to not be present in chloroplasts (Vierstra (1996) Plant Mol. Biol. 32:275-302), the ubiquitin-hGH fusion was processed during synthesis, accumulation or purification from the plants to produce a phenylalanine N-terminus hGH product (F-hGH). The control construct carrying the full- length cDNA encoded methionine and alanine as the first amino acids of hGH. As described in the Examples below, constructs comprising nucleic acid sequences encoding aprotinin (also known as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI) were employed in plastid expression constructs of the present invention. Aprotinin is a basic protein present in several bovine organs and tissues, such as the lymph nodes, pancreas, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
lungs, parotid gland, spleen and liver. Aprotinin is known to inhibit various serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin and kallikrein, and is used therapeutically in the treatment of acute pancreatitis, various stages of shock syndrome, hyperfibrinolytic hemorrhage and myocardial infarction. In addition, administration of aprotinin in high doses significantly reduces blood loss in connection with cardiac surgery, including cardiopulmonary bypass (Bidstrup, et al. (1989) Cardiovasc Surg. 44:640-645)</p><p num="p0048">In developing the constructs, the various fragments comprising the regulatory regions and open reading frame may be subjected to different processing conditions, such as ligation, restriction enzyme digestion, PCR, in vitro mutagenesis, linkers and adapters addition, and the like. Thus, nucleotide transitions, transversions, insertions, deletions, or the like, may be performed on the DNA which is employed in the regulatory regions or the DNA sequences of interest for expression in the plastids. Methods for restriction digests, Klenow blunt end treatments, ligations, and the like are well known to those in the art and are described, for example, by Maniatis et al. (in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).</p><p num="p0049">During the preparation of the constructs, the various fragments of DNA will often be cloned in an appropriate cloning vector, which allows for amplification of the DNA, modification of the DNA or manipulation of the DNA by joining or removing sequences, linkers, or the like. Preferably, the vectors will be capable of replication to at least a relatively high copy number in E. coli. A number of vectors are readily available for cloning, including such vectors as pBR322, vectors of the pUC series, the M13 series vectors, and pBluescript vectors (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA).</p><p num="p0050">In order to provide a means of selecting the desired plant cells, vectors for plastid transformation typically contain a construct which provides for expression of a selectable marker gene. Marker genes are plant-expressible DNA sequences which express a polypeptide which resists a natural inhibition by, attenuates, or inactivates a selective substance, including, but not limited to, antibiotic, herbicide etc.</p><p num="p0051">Alternatively, a marker gene may provide some other visibly reactive response, i.e., may cause a distinctive appearance or growth pattern relative to plants or plant cells not expressing the selectable marker gene in the presence of some substance, either as applied directly to the plant or plant cells or as present in the plant or plant cell growth media.</p><p num="p0052">In either case, the plants or plant cells containing such selectable marker genes will have a distinctive phenotype for purposes of identification, i.e., they will be 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
distinguishable from non-transformed cells. The characteristic phenotype allows the identification of cells, cell groups, tissues, organs, plant parts or whole plants containing the construct.</p><p num="p0053">Detection of the marker phenotype makes possible the selection of cells having a second gene to which the marker gene has been linked. This second gene typically comprises a desirable phenotype which is not readily identifiable in transformed cells, but which is present when the plant cell or derivative thereof is grown to maturity, even under conditions wherein the selectable marker phenotype itself is not apparent.</p><p num="p0054">The use of such a marker for identification of plant cells containing a plastid construct has been described by Svab et al (1993, supra). In the examples provided below, a bacterial aadA gene is expressed as the marker under the regulatory control of chloroplast 5' promoter and 3' transcription termination regions, specifically the regulatory regions of the psbA gene (described in Staub et al, EMBO 7.(1993) 12(2):601-606). Numerous additional promoter regions can also be used to drive expression of the selectable marker gene, including various plastid promoters and bacterial promoters which have been shown to function in plant plastids.</p><p num="p0055">Expression of the aadA gene confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, and thus allows for the identification of plant cells expressing this marker. The aadA gene product allows for continued growth and greening of cells whose chloroplasts comprise the selectable marker gene product. Cells which do not contain the selectable marker gene product are bleached. Selection for the aadA gene marker is thus based on identification of plant cells which are not bleached by the presence of streptomycin, or more preferably spectinomycin, in the plant growth medium.</p><p num="p0056">A number of markers have been developed for use with plant cells, such as resistance to chloramphenicol, the aminoglycoside G418, hygromycin, or the like. Other genes which encode a product involved in chloroplast metabolism may also be used as selectable markers. For example, genes which provide resistance to plant herbicides such as glyphosate, bromoxynil or imidazolinone may find particular use. Such genes have been reported (Stalker et al, J. Biol. Chem. (1985) 2(50:4724-4728 (glyphosate resistant EPSP); Stalker et al, J. Biol. Chem. (1985) 263:6310-6314 (bromoxynil resistant nitrilase gene); and Sathasivan et al, Nucl Acids Res. (1990) iδ:2188 (AHAS imidazolinone resistance gene)).

 Stable transformation of tobacco plastid genomes by particle bombardment is reported (Svab et. al. (1990), supra) and Svab et al. (1993), supra). The methods described therein may be employed to obtain plants homoplasmic for plastid expression constructs. Generally, bombarded tissue is cultured for approximately 2 days on a cell division-promoting media, after which the plant tissue is transferred to a selective media containing an inhibitory amount of the particular selective agent, as well as the particular hormones and other substances necessary to obtain regeneration for that particular plant species. Shoots are then subcultured on the same selective media to ensure production and selection of homoplasmic shoots.</p><p num="p0057">Transplastomic tobacco plants are analyzed for a pure population of transformed plastid genomes (homoplasmic lines). Homoplasmy is verified using Southern analysis employing nucleic acid probes spanning a region of the transgene and chloroplast genome (i.e. the insertion region). Transplastomic plants which are heteroplasmic (i.e. contain a mixture of plastid genomes containing and lacking the transgene) are characterized by a hybridization pattern of wild type and transgenic bands. Homoplasmic plants show a hybridization pattern lacking the wild type band.</p><p num="p0058">Alternatively, homoplasmy may be verified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR primers are utilized which are targeted to amplify from sequences from the insertion region. For example, a pair of primers may be utilized in a PCR reaction. One primer amplifies from a region in the transgene, while the second primer amplifies from a region proximal to the insertion region towards the insertion region. A second PCR reaction is performed using primers designed to amplify the region of insertion. Transplastomic lines identified as homoplasmic produce the expected size fragment in the first reaction, while they do not produce the predicted size fragment in the second reaction.</p><p num="p0059">Where transformation and regeneration methods have been adapted for a given plant species, either by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, bombardment or some other method, the established techniques may be modified for use in selection and regeneration methods to produce plastid-transformed plants. For example, the methods described herein for tobacco are readily adaptable to other solanaceous species, such as tomato, petunia and potato.</p><p num="p0060">For transformation of soybean, particle bombardment as well as Agrobacterium- mediated nuclear transformation and regeneration protocols have been described (Hinchee

et al. USPN 5,416,011, and Christou et al. USPN 5,015,580). The skilled artisan will recognize that protocols described for soybean transformation may be used</p><p num="p0061">In Brassica, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and regeneration protocols generally involve the use of hypocotyl tissue, a non-green tissue which might contain a low plastid content. Thus, for Brassica, preferred target tissues would include microspore- derived hypocotyl or cotyledonary tissues (which are green and thus contain numerous plastids) or leaf tissue explants. While the regeneration rates from such tissues may be low, positional effects, such as seen with Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, are not expected, thus it would not be necessary to screen numerous successfully transformed plants in order to obtain a desired phenotype.</p><p num="p0062">For cotton, transformation of Gossypium hirsutum L. cotyledons by co-cultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been described by Firoozabady et al, Plant Mol. Bio. (1987) 10: 105-116 and Umbeck et al, Bio/Technology (1987) 5:263-266. Again, as for Brassica, this tissue may contain insufficient plastid content for chloroplast transformation. Thus, as for Brassica, an alternative method for transformation and regeneration of alternative target tissue containing chloroplasts may be desirable, for instance targeting green embryogenic tissue.</p><p num="p0063">Other plant species may be similarly transformed using related techniques. Alternatively, microprojectile bombardment methods, such as described by Klein et al. (Bio/Technology 0:286-291) may also be used to obtain nuclear transformed plants comprising the viral single subunit RNA polymerase expression constructs described herein. Cotton transformation by particle bombardment is reported in WO 92/15675, published September 17, 1992. Suitable plants for the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, soybean, cotton, alfalfa, oil seed rape, flax, tomato, sugar beet, sunflower, potato, tobacco, maize, wheat, rice and lettuce.</p><p num="p0064">The vectors for use in plastid transformation preferably include means for providing a stable transfer of the plastid expression construct and selectable marker construct into the plastid genome. This is most conveniently provided by regions of homology to the target plastid genome. The regions of homology flank the construct to be transferred and provide for transfer to the plastid genome by homologous recombination, via a double crossover into the genome. The complete DNA sequence of the plastid genome of tobacco has been reported (Shinozaki et al, EMBO J. (1986) 5:2043-2049). Complete DNA sequences of the plastid genomes from liverwort (Ohyamaet al, Nature

Where the regions of homology are present outside the inverted repeat regions of the plastid genome, one copy of the transgene is expected per transformed plastid. The regions of homology within the plastid genome are approximately lkb in size. Smaller regions of homology may also be used, and as little as 100 bp can provide for homologous recombination into the plastid genome. However, the frequency of recombination and thus the frequency of obtaining plants having transformed plastids decreases with decreasing size of the homology regions.</p><p num="p0066">Examples of constructs having regions of homology within the plastid genome are described in Svab et.al. (1990 supra), Svab et al. (1993 supra) and Zoubenko et al. (Nuc Acid Res (1994) 22(19):3819-3824). As described in more detail in the examples below, constructs are described which provide for enhanced expression of DNA sequences in plant plastids. Various promoter/ribosome binding site sequences are employed to direct expression in plant plastids. Promoter sequences of the 16S ribosomal RNA operon (Prrø) are linked to a ribosome binding site (RBS) derived from the T7 bacteriophage gene 10 leader sequence (G10L). DNA sequences expressed under the regulatory control of the Rrrn/GXOh sequence show a significantly higher level of protein expression than those levels obtained under the control of other promoter/RBS combinations, while expression of mRNA may or may not be higher in these plants.</p><p num="p0067">In the examples below, nucleic acid sequences encoding CP4 EPSP synthase (USPN 5,633,435) are placed into expression constructs for expression of EPSP synthase enzyme from the plant plastid. Furthermore, a DNA sequence encoding for hGH (USPN 5,424,199) is also placed into expression construct for the expression of human growth hormone from the plant plastid. The constructs prepared utilize a ribosome binding site designed after the T7 bacteriophage gene 10 leader (G10L) to increase the expression of the nucleic acid sequences in the plant plastid.</p><p num="p0068">Plastid expression constructs encoding for the expression of EPSPS and hGH are introduced via a chloroplast transformation vector.

 Tobacco lines containing the native encoding sequence to the EPSPS enzyme expressed in plastids under the control of the Prra/GIOL promoter/ribosome binding site sequence demonstrate a significantly higher level of protein expression than those levels obtained from EPSPS expressed under the control of the Prrn/rbcL RBS sequence. However, EPSPS mRNA is expressed at a higher level in plants expressing CP4 EPSPS from the plastid under the control of the Prrn/rbcL(RBS). These results indicate that translation from transcripts containing the T7 bacteriophage gene 10 ribosome binding site is more efficient. In addition, protein expression levels of EPSPS obtained from transplastomic tobacco lines expressing EPSPS under the control of the Prm/GIOL RBS provide for a high level of glyphosate tolerance.</p><p num="p0069">Furthermore, transplastomic tobacco lines transformed to express hGH under the control of the Prr«/G10L promoter/ribosome binding site sequence demonstrate a significantly higher level of protein expression than those levels obtained from hGH expressed under the control of the PpsbA promoter/RBS sequence. Increases in protein expression levels of at least approximately 200 fold may be obtained from constructs utilizing Prra/GIOL ribosome binding site for expression of EPSPS and hGH over the expression levels obtained from other promoter/RBS combinations for plastid expression. In addition, protein levels obtained from plastid expression constructs utilizing the Prm/GIOL promoter/RBS sequence may accumulate 50 to 3500 fold higher levels than from nuclear expression constructs. Thus, inclusion of the G10L ribosome binding site in plastid expression constructs may find use for increasing the levels of protein expression from plant plastids.</p><p num="p0070">Furthermore, the constructs of the present invention may also include sequences to target the expressed protein to a particular suborganellar region, for example, the thylakoid lumen of the chloroplast. For example, as described in the examples below, a nucleotide sequence encoding a peptide from the plastid genome cytochrome / targets the expressed aprotinin protein to the thylakoid membrane. Such targeting of expressed proteins may provide for a compartmentalization of the protein allowing for increased oxidative stability and proper protein folding.</p><p num="p0071">The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are included for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the present invention.

Tobacco plants transformed to express hGH in the nucleus accumulated hGH levels of 0.002% (cytoplasmic targeted) to 0.025% (plastid targeted) of total soluble leaf protein, while tobacco plants expressing hGH in the plastid accumulated hGH levels of 0.2% to 7.0% of the total soluble leaf protein as hGH. Furthermore, homoplasmic tobacco plants expressing hGH directed from the Prra/GIOL regulatory sequences accumulate 35 fold higher levels of hGH than homoplasmic tobacco plants expressing hGH directed from the PpsbA promoter sequence. The higher level of expression may be due to the strong Prrn promoter and/or to enhanced translation of the fusion gene mediated by the gene 10 leader rbs region. Leaves of different ages had varied hGH accumulation patterns, with mature

Ubiquitin processing was often observed at &gt;50% of total hST protein species, depending on extraction conditions. This result confirms the utility of the fusion protein approach in chloroplast-expressed proteins. The appearance of an extra band observed in the Nt-4838 sample is consistent with an hGH dimer.</p><p num="p0198">For comparison of expression systems in plants, nuclear transgenic plants were generated that express hGH from two different sets of expression signals. The wrg4747 and wrg4776 constructs expresses hGH using the strong Figwort Mosaic Virus promoter or the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter, respectively. The wrg4747 construct employs a chloroplast transit peptide to post-translationally target hGH to chloroplasts (FMV::CTP-hGH), whereas the wrg4776 construct targets the hGH through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the secretory pathway (35S::ER-hST). Transgenic lines for both constructs were obtained through particle bombardment. Expression of hST was quantitated by ELISA assay and shown to be less than 0.025% tsp.

These cells proliferate in the presence of growth hormone and other estrogenic type compounds. The assay involves putting various concentrations of growth hormone-containing extract into a 96 well plate. Then a constant amount of cells are added to each well. The plate is incubated for 48hrs and then a reagent called MTS is added. Metabolizing cells take up the MTS and convert it to a blue colored substance. The more cells there are the more blue color in the well. The blue color is measured using a spectrophotometer. The number of cells should be proportional to the concentration of growth hormone in the media. At some high concentration one expects that the cells will become saturated with growth hormone and that the dose response will level off. At very low hGH concentrations essentially no enhanced growth is seen. A sigmoidal shape graph is expected to be produced graphing the cell number (or absorbance) versus hGH concentration graph.</p><p num="p0213">Proper disulfide pairing in the chloroplast hGH implies that the protein should be biologically active. To test this hypothesis in vitro, a rat lymphoma cell line, Nb2, that proliferates in the presence of somatotropin (hGH) and other estrogenic type compounds was employed.
