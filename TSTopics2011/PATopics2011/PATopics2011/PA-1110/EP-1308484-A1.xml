combination with other binder components.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p num="0001">The present invention relates to binders for self-polishing antifouling paints.
More particularly, it relates to the use of silylesters as binder in self-polishing
antifouling paints.</p><p num="0002">Many existing antifouling paints used for ships to prevent barnacles and
other marine life from attaching to the ships' hulls work by slowly leaching
metallic compounds into the sea. But studies have shown that these
compounds persist in the water, killing sea life, harming the environment
and possibly entering the food chain. One of the most effective types of
antifouling paint, developed in the 1960s, contains the organotin tributyltin
(TBT), which has been proven to cause deformations in oysters and sex
changes in whelks.</p><p num="0003">The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a unit of the United Nations,
adopted on 5 October 2001 an International Convention on the Control of
Harmful Antifouling Systems at the end of a five-day Diplomatic Conference
held in London.</p><p num="0004">The proposed antifouling convention comes in response to Assembly
resolution A.895 (21) (Antifouling systems used on ships, adopted by IMO
in November 1999, which called on IMO's Marine Environment Protection
Committee ( MEPC) to develop an instrument, legally binding throughout
the world, to address the harmful effects of antifouling systems used on
ships).</p><p num="0005">The resolution calls for a global prohibition on the application of organotin
compounds which act as biocides in antifouling systems on ships by 1
January 2003, and a complete prohibition on the presence of organotin 
compounds which act as biocides in antifouling systems on ships by 1
January 2008.</p><p num="0006">The harmful environmental effects of organotin compounds were
recognized by IMO in 1990, when the MEPC adopted a resolution which
recommended that Governments adopt measures to eliminate the use of
antifouling paint containing TBT on non-aluminium hulled vessels of less
than 25 meters in length and eliminate the use of antifouling paints with a
leaching rate of more than 4 micrograms of TBT per day. Some countries,
such as Japan, have already banned TBT in antifouling paint for most
ships.</p><p num="0007">There is therefore a need in the art for improved erodable antifouling paint
compositions containing no organotin compound, while retaining the good
antifouling and self-polishing properties of the tin-containing antifouling
paints of the prior art.</p><p num="0008">Tin-free systems are well known in the art:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>Antifouling paints containing rosin and similarly soluble salts thereof
exist for many years. Rosin is slightly soluble in seawater (8.6 x 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L
at pH = 8.1). Due to its low molecular weight, rosin is blended with another
binder to provide an appropriate film-forming performance.</li><li>Paints based on a combination of wood rosin with copper- or zinc-pyrithione
have been found to thicken or gel unacceptably within a few
days. US 5,112,397 (Olin Corp.) discloses paints containing an amine
compound or esterified wood rosin to impart desired gelation-inhibition.</li><li>EP 289481 and EP 526441 (Sigma Coatings), WO 9744401
(Hempel's) disclose systems based on rosin in combination with a film 
forming binder. However, the coatings produced in accordance with these
specifications suffer from the technical problem that their coatings are
nowadays classified as "ablative" since the erosion is not based on a real
chemical hydrolysis but well on a complex process which weakens the
surface layer by a combination of dissolving and leaching followed by
frictional abrasives forces leading to higher surface roughness (at micron
scale ablative pattern) and an irregular erosion rate of the coating.</li><li>Systems based on copper (or zinc) acrylates are described in EP
342276 (Nippon Paint), GB 2 311 070 (Kansa√Ø Paint), US 5 545 823 and
US 5 382 281 (Yung Chi Paint). Based on cheap raw materials these tin-free
systems suffer from several drawbacks. Indeed, their production
requires a dedicated equipment and their composition is very difficult to
assess by chemical analysis. Further, the use of copper in antifouling
systems will certainly be restricted in the forthcoming years. An example of
that trend is the Dutch ban on the application of copper-containing
antifouling paints on yachts smaller than 25 meters.</li><li>Systems based on silyl acrylates were disclosed by M&amp;T (WO
8402915, EP 00131621), and further developed by Chugoku ( EP 775733
), Nippon Oils &amp; Fats ( EP 297505, EP 646630, EP 714957, EP 802243 )
and Sigma Coatings (WO 0162811 and WO 0162858)</li></ul></p><p num="0009">It is known in the art that rosin or rosin derivatives may be used in
combination with hydrolysable acrylates in order to improve some of their
properties.</p><p num="0010">EP 530205 (Courtaulds) discloses the use of rosin amine D in combination
with copper acrylates .

WO 0043460 (Akzo Nobel) discloses some advantages of using blends of
rosin (and its derivatives) with zinc/copper acrylates. </p><p num="0011">EP 1016681 (Chugoku) discloses that the blending of rosin (and its
derivatives) with trialkylsilyl(meth)acrylate co-polymers improve the ability
to erode at static conditions (e.g. during the outfitting period in the building
of new ships) and by this having a superior antifouling performance. The
recoatability and the resistance to cracking and detachment were also
claimed to be improved by this blending</p><p num="0012">EP 802243 (Nippon Oils &amp; Fats) discloses blends of at least one compound
selected from rosin, rosin derivatives and rosin metal salts with certain
polymers containing organosilyl ester groups as binder in self-polishing
antifouling paints, leading to improved properties after long-term
immersion.

Nowadays, the ship owners continue to request an excellent performance
over increasingly longer periods of time, in order to reduce the frequency of
dry-docking the ships to apply a fresh coating on their hulls. There is thus
a continuous need in the art for alternative and improved self-polishing
antifouling paint compositions.</p><p num="0013">The inventor has surprisingly found that the "ablative" effect of the
antifouling paints based on rosin or rosin metal salts could be largely
overcome by using silylesters of rosin (alternatively called silylated
resinates or silyl abietates).</p><p num="0014">Thus the present invention provides the use in self-polishing antifouling
paints of silylesters of rosin as binder component of the binder system.</p><p num="0015">For the purpose of this specification, the term "binder system" means a
composition consisting essentially of silylesters of rosin and optionally other
binder components well known by the man of the art. </p><p num="0016">The present invention provides also a process for preparing self-polishing
antifouling paints characterised in that one step of the process is the
addition of silylesters of rosin as binder component of the binder system.</p><p num="0017">The invention is based on the recognition that the self-polishing properties
of antifouling paints containing rosin were insufficient due to the presence
of free carboxylic groups on the rosin; said properties being unexpectedly
found to be greatly improved after reaction of the free carboxylic group of
rosin with a silyl group.</p><p num="0018">Rosin is a loosely used term, denoting the result of a harvesting of the gum
exudations from surface cuts made in certain species of trees. Rosin is
sometimes defined restrictively as the product obtained from pines; similar
products comprised in the generic term "rosin" as used herein include
Congo copal, Kauri copal, Damar and Manilla gums. Other processes for
obtaining rosin include dissolving wood rosin from pine stumps after forests
have been felled, or refining a by-product of the kraft paper manufacturing
process to produce tall oil rosin.

Pine-originating rosin is preferably chosen. The main component (about 80
%) of rosin is abietic acid, also called sylvic acid (CAS RN. = 514-10-03),
which could be used instead of rosin.</p><p num="0019">The silylester of rosin in this invention can also be a silylester of a rosin
derivative.

In the present context the term "rosin derivative" is intended to mean all
types of rosin (as defined above) modified or derivatised according to
various chemical reactions or processes which leave at least one carboxylic
acid group per molecule available for silylation. A number of processes are
expected to lead to rosin derivatives which have superior paint constituent
properties with respect to improvement of the mechanical properties and/or
control of the self-polishing properties. </p><p num="0020">As examples, one can cite:
<sl><li>A. the adducts of unsaturated acids (such as acrylic acid, maleic acid
or fumaric acid)-and the mono-esters of di-acids with rosin.</li><li>B. adducts of rosin itself (dimerised rosin, oligomerised or polymerised
rosin)</li><li>C. hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated rosin</li><li>D. dismutated or disproportionated rosins</li></sl></p><p num="0021">A more extensive description of rosin and rosin derivatives can be found in
WO 9744401 (Hempel's).</p><p num="0022">Commercially available examples of some rosin and rosin derivatives are
given in Table 1. Most of these examples have high softening points and
have therefore no adhesive properties.

may be the same or different, including methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl,
isobutyl, t-butyl and phenyl. An example of silylating agent with
different substituents is dimethyl t-butyl silyl chloride. The preferred
substituents are methyl and ethyl, more preferred substituents being
methyl.</p><p num="0026">According to another preferred embodiment, di-, tri- , tetrafunctional
silylating agents and mixtures thereof can also be used, for example
dimethylsilyl dichloride, ethylsilyl trichloride and tetrachlorosilane, to obtain
respectively dialkylsilyl diresinate, alkylsilyl triresinate, silyl tetraresinate
and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0027">An object of the present invention is the use in self-polishing antifouling
paints of silylesters of rosin as binder component of the binder system
wherein the silylesters of rosin are in an amount of from 5 to 100% by
weight, based on the total weight of the binder system composition. </p><p num="0028">According to an embodiment, the silylesters of rosin are used in an amount

amount of 100% by weight, based on the total weight of the binder system
composition.</p><p num="0031">The inventor has now surprisingly found that the complete conversion of the
acid functionality of rosin compounds into a silylester has many advantages
for paint formulation, manufacturing and stability by providing a silyl ester
that is :
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>Inert to reactive pigments such as zinc oxide and cuprous oxide. It
is well known that self-polishing antifouling paints containing rosin
compounds react through their free acid functionality with reactive
pigments, in practice always present in antifouling paints, such as zinc
oxide or cuprous oxide, to form the corresponding salts e.g. zinc resinate or
cuprous resinate. The metal salts of resinates have the disadvantage of
being hardly soluble in seawater and having poor adhesive and film forming
properties.</li><li>Inert to biocides. There is for example no more risk of gelation that
usually occurs when zinc/copper pyrithione is used in rosin-based
formulations. It is well known that zinc pyrithione is one of the modern
biocides used in antifouling paints but that it has the disadvantage of being
unstable in the presence of carboxylic acid groups and/or the metal salts of
carboxylic acid groups. This biocide can therefore e.g. not without special
precautions be used in rosin-based paints because they always do contain 
carboxylic acid groups to some extent which lead to an irreversible gelation
of the paint.</li><li>More sensitive to dissolving and erosion processes in water (fresh
water or seawater).</li><li>Less brittle; in other words having a lower glass transition
temperature (Tg) and softening point than corresponding metal salts of the
resinate species concerned.</li></ul></p><p num="0032">Indeed, whilst the reaction of rosin compounds with zinc oxide or cuprous
oxide has the effect of increasing the softening point and the Tg as well,
e.g. softening point from 70 ¬∞C for rosin to 160 ¬∞C for zinc resinate. In
contrast there is hardly an increase when the acid function of rosin
compounds has reacted with a silyl group according to the invention (e.g.
Tg values in example 1: from 52 ¬∞C for rosin to only 62 ¬∞C for trimethylsilyl
resinate).</p><p num="0033">The hydrolysable silylesters of rosin can be used as sole resin or preferably
in combination with other binders to form a binder system that are
commonly in use in antifouling formulations. When other binders are
present, those are in an amount of from more than 0 up to 95% by weight,
based on the total weight of the binder system composition.</p><heading><u style="single">Examples of other binders are:</u></heading><p num="0034"><ul list-style="bullet"><li>Resinates of Ca, Cu or Zn</li><li>Naphthenates of Ca, Cu, Zn</li><li>Vinyls like Laroflex MP (commercially available from BASF)</li><li>Acrylates like Neocryl B725 (commercially available from Avecia)</li><li>Cu/Zn/Ca acrylates, e.g. as described in EP 342276; EP 982324

(Jotun), EP 526441 and EP 289441 (SIGMA COATINGS). It has been
observed that blends of the hydrophilic acrylic resins such as described in
EP 526441 and EP 289441 with a silylester of rosin had improved
properties over blends with zinc resinate. The film was more flexible, had
better adhesive properties and showed a hydrolysis-driven erosion process
at pH 12 while not showing defects upon immersion in fresh and sea water
conditions (pH 7 and 8 respectively).</li> </ul></p><p num="0035">The following non-limiting examples illustrate the invention. The measuring
methods used in the examples are given further.</p><heading><u style="single">Example 1 : synthesis of trimethylsilyl resinate</u></heading> <p num="0036">420 g Portugese gum rosin was put in a 2-L 4-necked flask and kept under
nitrogen. The four necks of the flask were equipped with stirring means, a
reflux cooler, a thermometer for temperature control of the reaction, and
means for addition of the reactants. The gum rosin was dissolved in a
solvent mixture of 218 g xylene and 850 g toluene. Here after 128 gram triethylamine
was carefully added in 5 minutes under vigorous stirring. As a
consequence the temperature of the contents of the flask rose by 10¬∞C.
The addition of the tri-ethyl amine was followed by the slow addition of 138
g trimethylsilyl chloride under vigorous stirring.</p> <p num="0037">A white salt was instantaneously formed and the exothermic reaction made
the contents raise to a temperature of 50¬∞C. The reaction mixture was kept
at a temperature of 50¬∞C for 5 hours. Then the heating and the stirring was 
stopped. The next day the formed trimethylsilyl resinate was purified by
filtration and evaporation of the toluene solvent fraction. The yield was 530
g (circa 78 %) of a brown colored solution, that was 75 wt % in solids and
had a viscosity of 3 dPa.s. The binder was very flexible and had a good
adhesion on glass and epoxy primer and showed hydrolysis within minutes
upon immersion in an alkaline solution of pH 12. This all in contrast with
zinc resinate which had a hard and brittle film with moderate adhesion on
glass and without showing any hydrolysis behavior up to pH 13. The binder
had a Tg of 62 ¬∞C.</p> <heading><u style="single">Example 2 : synthesis of dimethylsilyldiresinate</u></heading><p num="0038">The same equipment and procedures were used as for the synthesis of
example 1 with the following differences:

335 g Portugese gum rosin had been dissolved in 121 g xylene and 500 g
toluene.

To this had been added consecutively 101 g tri-ethyl amine and 64,5 g
dimethyldichlorosilane.

The yield was 300 g of a brown colored solution that was 70 wt % in solids
and had a viscosity of 10 dPa.s.

The binder had a good adhesion on glass and epoxy primers.

The binder was very sensitive to alkaline hydrolysis. A binder film dissolved
in water of pH 12 completely within 15 minutes.

The binder had a Tg of 52 ¬∞C.</p><p num="0039">Some properties of trimethylsilyl resinate and dimethylsilyl resinate are

paint to be tested were applied, to give a total dry film thickness
between 200 and 300 ¬µm. The tests were carried out in constantly
refreshed natural seawater, at a constant temperature of 20 ¬∞C. The discs
were rotated at 1000 rpm, corresponding to about 34 km/h (18 knots) at 9
