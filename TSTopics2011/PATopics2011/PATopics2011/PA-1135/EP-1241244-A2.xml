separation of isomeric mixtures, such techniques now being routinely used in the preparation of
optically pure pharmaceuticals. Suitable techniques include, but are not limited to the use of
isomerically pure intermediates, crystallization and preferably the use of chromatography
techniques. Liquid or gas chromatography can be used, with gas chromatography being the
preferred technique. US Patent Numbers 5,629,333; 5,629,329; 5,627,183; 5,589,511; 5,571,827;
5,561,151; 5,545,745;_5,532,278; 5,510,352; 5,508,279 and 5,492,933 are herein incorporated by
reference as if set forth in their entirety, are just a few of the many patents that describe techniques
for the separation of isomeric materials using various techniques.</p><p num="0010">Using these separation techniques, the yields of the individual compounds: tetrahydro-4-methylene-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2H-pyran;
5,6-dihydro-4-methyl-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2H-pyran; 
and 3,6-dihydro-4-methyl-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2H-pyran can exceed more than 80 weight
percent, typically greater than about 90 and in preferred embodiments can exceed 95 weight
percent of a desired isomer depending on the time and expense that is taken to isolate the desired
compound. It is within the skill of those in the art to obtain greater than 99 weight percent of an
individual isomer depending on the technique and time employed in the separation process.</p><p num="0011">The use of this material is widely applicable in current perfumery products, including the
preparation of perfumes and colognes, the perfuming of personal care products such as soaps,
shower gels, and hair care products as well as air fresheners and cosmetic preparations. The
present invention can also be used to perfume cleaning agents, such as, but not limited to
detergents, dishwashing materials, scrubbing compositions, window cleaners and the like.</p><p num="0012">In these preparations, the compound of the present invention can be used alone or in
combination with other perfuming compositions, solvents, adjuvants and the like. The nature and
variety of the other ingredients that can be employed are known to those with skill in the art.</p><p num="0013">Many types of fragrances can be employed in the present invention, the only limitation
being the compatibility with the other components being employed. Suitable fragrances include but
are not limited to fruits such as almond, apple, cherry, grape, pear, pineapple, orange, strawberry,
raspberry; musk, flower scents such as lavender-like, rose-like, iris-like, and carnation-like. Other
pleasant scents include herbal and woodland scents derived from pine, spruce and other forest
smells. Fragrances may also be derived from various oils, such as essential oils, or from plant
materials such as peppermint, spearmint and the like.</p><p num="0014">A list of suitable fragrances is provided in US Pat. No. 4,534,891, the contents of which are
incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Another source of suitable fragrances is
found in <u style="single">Perfumes, Cosmetics and Soaps</u>, Second Edition, edited by W. A. Poucher, 1959. Among
the fragrances provided in this treatise are acacia, cassie, chypre, cyclamen, fern, gardenia,
hawthorn, heliotrope, honeysuckle, hyacinth, jasmine, lilac, lily, magnolia, mimosa, narcissus,
freshly-cut hay, orange blossom, orchid, reseda, sweet pea, trefle, tuberose, vanilla, violet,
wallflower, and the like.</p><p num="0015">Olfactory effective amount is understood to mean the amount of compound in perfume
compositions the individual component will contribute to its particular olfactory characteristics, but
the olfactory effect of the perfume composition will be the sum of the effects of each of the
perfume or fragrance ingredients. Thus the compounds of the invention can be used to alter the 
aroma characteristics of the perfume composition, or by modifying the olfactory reaction
contributed by another ingredient in the composition. The amount will vary depending on many
factors including other ingredients, their relative amounts and the effect that is desired.</p><p num="0016">The level of compound of the invention employed in the perfumed article varies from
about 0.005 to about 10 weight percent, typically from about 0.1 to about 9; preferably from about
0.5 to about 8 and most preferably from about 1 to about 7 weight percent. In addition to the
compounds, other agents can be used in conjunction with the fragrance. Well known materials
such as surfactants, emulsifiers, polymers to encapsulate the fragrance can also be employed
without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p num="0017">Another method of reporting the level of the compounds of the invention in the perfumed
composition, i.e., the compounds as a weight percentage of the materials added to impart the
desired fragrance. The compounds of the invention can range widely from 0.005 to about 70
weight percent of the perfumed composition, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50 and most
preferably from about 0.2 to about 25 weight percent. Those with skill in the art will be able to
employ the desired level of the compounds of the invention to provide the desired fragrance and
intensity.</p><p num="0018">The following are provided as specific embodiments of the present invention. Other
modifications of this invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing
from the scope of this invention. As used herein all percentages are weight percent and g is
understood to be grams. IFF as used in the examples is understood to mean International Flavors &amp;
