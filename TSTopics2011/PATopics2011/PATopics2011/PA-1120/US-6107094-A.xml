Included in the invention are oligoribonucleotidies having modified sugars, bases or phosphate backbones and oligoribonucleosides having standard sugars and bases or modified sugars and bases linked together via non-phosphate backbones. Further included in the invention are chimeric oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides having mixed backbones, either phosphate or non-phosphate. Also included in the invention are mammalian ribonucleases, i.e., enzymes that degrade RNA. Such a ribonuclease is referred to herein as a dsRNase, wherein "ds" indicates the RNase's specificity for certain double-stranded RNA substrates. The oligoribonucleotides, oligoribonucleosides, ribonucleases and ribonuclease substrates of the invention are useful for therapeutics, diagnostics and as research reagents.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>Oligonucleotides are known to hybridize to single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules. Hybridization is the sequence-specific base pair hydrogen bonding of nucleobases of the oligonucleotides to nucleobases of target DNA or RNA. Such nucleobase pairs are said to be complementary to one another.</p><p>The complementarity of oligonucleotides has been, used for inhibition of a number of cellular targets. Such complementary oligonucleotides are commonly described as being antisense oligonucleotides. Various reviews describing the results of these studies have been published including Progress In Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapeutics, Crooke, S. T. and Bennett, C. F., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 1996, 36, 107-129. These oligonucleotides have proven to be very powerful research tools and diagnostic agents. Further, certain oligonucleotides that have been shown to be efficacious are currently in human clinical trials.</p><p>To date most oligonucleotides studied have been oligodeoxynucleotides. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides are believed to cause a reduction in target RNA levels principally through the action of RNase H, an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of DNA:RNA duplexes. This enzyme, thought to play a role in DNA replication, has been shown to be capable of cleaving the RNA component of the DNA:RNA duplexes in cell free systems as well as in Xenopus oocytes. Rnase H is very sensitive to structural alterations in antisense oligonucleotides. This sensitivity is such that prior attempts to increase the potency of oligonucleotides by increasing affinity, stability, lipophilicity and other characteristics by chemical modifications of the oligonucleotide have often resulted in oligonucleotides that are no longer substrates for Rnase H. In addition, Rnase H activity is quite variable. Thus a given disease state may not be a candidate for antisense therapy only because the target tissue has insufficient Rnase H activity. Therefore it is clear that effective terminating mechanisms in addition to Rnase H are of great value to the development of therapeutic and other agents.</p><p>Several publications describe the interaction of Rnase H and oligonucleotides. A recently publication is: Crooke, et. al., Biochem. J., 1995, 312, 599-608. Other earlier papers are: (1) Dagle et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1990, 18, 4751; (2) Dagle et al., Antisense Research Arid Development, 1991, 1, 11; (3) Eder et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1991, 266, 6472; and (4) Dagle et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1991, 19, 1805. According to these publications, DNA oligonucleotides having both unmodified phosphodiester internucleoside linkages and modified phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages are substrates for cellular RNase H.</p><p>Since they are substrates, they activate the cleavage of target RNA by RNase H. However, these authors further noted that in Xenopus embryos, both phosphodiester linkages and phosphorothioate linkages are also subject to exonuclease degradation.</p><p>Nuclease degradation is detrimental since it rapidly depletes the oligonucleotide.</p><p>As described in references (1), (2) and (4), to stabilize oligonucleotides against nuclease degradation while still providing for RNase H activation, 2'-deoxy oligonucleotides having a short section of phosphodiester linked nucleosides positioned between sections of phosphoramidate, alkyl phosphonate or phosphotriester linkages were constructed. While the phosphoramidate-containing oligonucleotides were stabilized against exonucleases, in reference (4) the authors noted that each phosphoramidate linkage resulted in a loss of 1.6.degree. C. in the measured T.sub.m value of the phosphoramidate-containing oligonucleotides. Such a decrease in the T.sub.m value is indicative of a decrease in hybridization between the oligonucleotide and its target strand.</p><p>Other authors have commented on the effect such a loss of hybridization between an oligonucleotide and its target strand can have. Saison-Behmoaras et al. (EMBO Journal, 1991, 10, 1111) observed that even though an oligonucleotide could be a substrate for Rnase H, cleavage efficiency by Rnase H was low because of weak hybridization to the MRNA. The authors also noted that the inclusion of an acridine substitution at the 3' end of the oligonucleotide protected the oligonucleotide from exonucleases.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,830, issued May 7, 1991, discloses mixed oligomers comprising an RNA oligomer, or a derivative thereof, conjugated to a DNA oligomer via a phosphodiester linkage. The RNA oligomers also bear 2'-O-alkyl substituents. However, being phosphodiesters, the oligomers are susceptible to nuclease cleavage. European Patent application 339,842, published Nov. 2, 1989, discloses 2'-O-substituted phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, including 2'-O-methylribooligonucleotide phosphorothioate derivatives. The above-mentioned application also discloses 2'-O-methyl phosphodiester oligonucleotides which lack nuclease resistance.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,149,797, issued Sep. 22, 1992, discloses mixed phosphate backbone oligonucleotides which include an internal portion of deoxynucleotides linked by phosphodiester linkages, and flanked on each side by a portion of modified DNA or RNA sequences. The flanking sequences include methyl phosphonate, phosphoromorpholidate, phosphoropiperazidate or phosphoramidate linkages.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,775, issued Oct. 26, 1993, describes mixed oligonucleotides that incorporate phosphoramidate linkages and phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate linkages.</p><p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,711, issued Apr. 4, 1995, describes RNA:DNA probes targeted to DNA. The probes are labeled and are used in a system that includes RNase H. The RNase H enzyme cleaves those probes that bind to DNA targets.</p><p>The probes can include modified phosphate groups. Mentioned are phosphotriester, hydrogen phosphonates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates, alkyl or aryl phosphoramidates, phosphorothioates or phosphoroselenates.</p><p>In contrast to the pharmacological inhibition of gene expression via the RNase H enzyme, it is becoming clear that organisms from bacteria to humans use endogenous antisense RNA transcripts to alter the stability of some target mRNAS and regulate gene expression, see Nellen, W., and Lichtenstein, C., Curr.Opin.Cell.Biol., 1993, 18, 419-424 and Nellen, W., el al, Biochem. Soc.Trans. 1992, 20, 750-754. Perhaps one of the best examples comes from certain bacteria where an antisense RNA regulates the expression of mok MRNA, which is required for the translation of the cytotoxic hok protein. Thus as the antisense level drops, mok mRNA levels and consequently hok protein levels rise and the cells die, see Gerdes, K. et al., J.Mol.Biol., 1992, 226, 637-649. Other systems regulated by such mechanisms in bacteria include the RNA I-RNA II hybrid of the ColE1 plasmid, see Haeuptle, M. T., Frank, R., and Dobberstein, B., Nucleic Acids Res. 1986, 14, 1427, Knecht, D., Cell Motil.Cytoskel., 1989, 14, 92-102; and Maniak, M., and Nellen, W., Nucleic Acids Res., 1990, 18, 5375-5380; OOP-cII RNA regulation in bacteriophage Lambda, see Krinke, L., and Wulff, D. L. (1990) Genes Dev., 1990, 4, 2223-2233; and the copA-copT hybrids in E.coli. See Blomberg, P., Wagner, Ei.G., and Nordstrom, K., EMBO J., 1990, 9, 2331-2340. In E.coli the RNA:RNA duplexes formed have been shown to be substrates for regulated degradation by the endoribonuclease RNase III. Duplex dependent degradation has also been observed in the archaebacterium, Halobacterium salinarium, where the anti sense transcript reduces expression of the early (Ti) transcript of the phage gene phiH, see Stolt, P., and Zillig, W., Mol. Microbiol., 1993, 7, 875-882. In several eukaryotic organisms endogenous antisense transcripts have also been observed. These include p53, see Khochbin and Lawrence, EMBO, 1989, 8, 4107-4114; basic fibroblast growth factor, see Volk et al, EMBO, 1989, 8, 69, 2983-2988; N-myc, see Krystal, G. W., Armstrong, B. C., and Battey, J. F., Mol. Cell. Biol., 1991, 10, 4180-4191; eIF-2α, see Noguchi et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269, 29161-29167. The conservation of endogenously expressed antisense transcripts across evolutionary lines suggests that their biological roles and molecular mechanisms of action may be similar.</p><p>In bacteria, RNase III is the double stranded endoribonuclease (dsRNase) activity responsible for the degradation of some antisense:sense RNA duplexes. RNase III carries out site-specific cleavage of dsRNA-containing structures, see Saito, H. and Richardson, C. C., Cell, 1981, 27, 533-540. The RNase III also plays an important role in mRNA processing and in the processing of rRNA precursors into 16S, 23S and 5S ribosomal RNAs, see Dunn, J. J. and Studier, F. W. J. Mol. Biol., 1975, 99, 487. In eukaryotes, a yeast gene (RUNT1) has recently been cloned that codes for a protein that has homology to E.coli RNase III and shows dsRNase activity in ribosomal RNA processing, see Elela, S. A., Igel, H. and Ares, M. Cell, 1996, 85, 115-124. Avian cells treated with interferon produce and secrete a soluble nuclease capable of degrading dsRNA, see Meegan, J. and Marcus, P. I., Science, 1989, 244, 1089-1091. However such a secreted dsRNA activity is not a likely candidate to be involved in cytoplasmic degradation of antisense:sense RNA duplexes. Despite these findings almost nothing is known about human or mammalian dsRNAse activities. While it has been recognized that regulation (via any mechanism) of a target RNA strand would be useful, to date only two mechanisms for eliciting such an effect are known. These are hybridization arrest and use of an oligodeoxynucleotide to effect RNase H cleavage of the RNA target. Accordingly, there remains a continuing long-felt need for methods and compounds for regulation of target RNA. Such regulation of target RNA would be useful for therapeutic purposes both in vivo and ex vivo and, as well as, for diagnostic reagents and as research reagents including reagents for the study of both cellular and in vitro events.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>In accordance with this invention there are provided oligomeric compounds formed from a linear sequence of linked ribonucleoside subunits that are specifically hybridizable to a preselected RNA target.

Heretofore, such activity has not recognized nor exploited in eukaryotic systems. It has now been found that the oligomeric compounds of the invention have certain RNA like features that allow them to form a double stranded structure with a targeted RNA region and this double stranded structure is subsequently degraded by eukaryotic dsRNases, i.e. double-stranded RNase enzymes, in a cell or test solution. Using T24 human bladder carcinoma cells as an illustrative eukaryotic cellular system, it has beer demonstrated that this activity is present at comparable levels in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions.</p><p>In certain illustrative procedures provided herein to illustrate this invention, in common with some other known nuclease activities, it has been found that this activity leaves 5' phosphate and 3' hydroxyl groups after cleavage of the RNA substrate. This generation of 5' phosphate, 3' hydroxyl termini is a feature in common with several other nucleases that recognize double-stranded nucleic acid molecules, including RNase HI and II that cleave the RNA component of a DNA:RNA duplex in E.coli., RNase III which catalyses the hydrolysis of high molecular weight double stranded RNA and mediates degradation of sense-antisense duplexes, and RNase V1.</p><p>Many components of mRNA degradation systems have been conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It has now been found that like prokaryotic organisms, in which RNase III carries out the degradation of sense-antisense hybrids to regulate expression of some genes, human cells have conserved an activity capable of performing a similar role. In addition to other uses including therapeutic and diagnostic uses, by virtue of this activity the compounds of this invention can be used as research reagents to assist in understanding how human cells use endogenously expressed antisense transcripts to modulate gene expression.</p><p>The vast majority of antisense oligonucleotides; used experimentally or currently being tested in the clinic in humans are modified oligodeoxynucleotides. It has been demonstrated that the heteroduplex formed between such oligodeoxynucleotide antisense compounds and their target RNA is recognized by an intracellular nuclease, RNase H, that cleaves only the RNA strand of this duplex. Although RNase H mediated degradation of target RNA has proven a useful mechanism, it has certain limitations. RNase H is highly sensitive to structural modifications made to the antisense oligonucleotides and thus most of the modifications designed to improve the therapeutic properties such as increased affinity, increased nuclease resistance and greater cellular permeability have resulted in oligonucleotides that do not support cleavage by RNase H. Another limitation to RNase 1H as a terminating mechanism of antisense action is the fact that the oligonucleotides must be DNA `like`, and in being DNA `like`, such oligonucleotides have inherently low affinity to their target RNA. Strategies designed to circumvent this low affinity include the design of "gapmer" oligonucleotides that are composed of a stretch of high affinity chemically modified oligonucleotides on the 5' and 3' ends (the wings) with a stretch of unmodified deoxyoligonucleotides in the center (the gap). DNA gapmers, i.e., oligodeoxynucleotides gapmers, have significantly higher affinities for their target than oligodeoxynucleotides, however, depending on the size of the DNA gap, RNase H activity has been shown to be compromised.</p><p>In using RNase H as a termination mechanism via RNA degradation, the cellular localization and tissue distribution of RNase H must also be considered. RNase H activity is primarily localized to the nucleus although it has been detected in the cytoplasm at lower levels. Most of a given mRNA is found in the cytoplasm of cells, therefore the ideal activity to be exploited as a terminating mechanism would be one with high levels in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p><p>RNase H activity also is highly variable from cell line to cell line or between tissues, thus a given disease state may not be a good candidate for RNA degradation only because the target tissue has insufficient RNase H activity. It is clear that alternative terminating mechanisms for degrading target RIA are highly desirable.</p><p>Among other uses, the activity that has now been recognized can now be exploited as an alternative terminating mechanism to RNase H for antisense therapeutics. It has been found that in using RNA-like oligonucleotides that have high affinity for their target and thus higher potency than DNA-like oligonucleotides, activity can be expressed in human cells. The presence of the activity in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus allows the compounds of the invention to be used to inhibit many RNA processing events from nuclear pre-mRNA splicing and transport to degradation of mature transcript in the cytoplasm.</p><p>To illustrate this invention and to compare it to other known antisense mechanisms, e.g. RNase H, the dsRNAse activity induced by the compounds of the invention has been examined by targeting it to codon 12 of Ha-ras. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,208, and its related application International Publication Number WO 92/22651, published Dec. 23, 1992, both commonly assigned with this application, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference, the ras oncogenes are members of a gene family that encode related proteins that are localized to the inner face of the plasma membrane and have been shown to be highly conserved at the amino acid level, to bind GTP with high affinity and specificity, and to possess GTPase activity. Although the cellular function of ras gene products is unknown, their biochemical properties, along with their significant sequence homology with a class of signal-transducing proteins, known as GTP binding proteins, or G proteins, suggest that ras gene products play a fundamental role in basic cellular regulatory functions related to the transduction of extracellular signals across plasma membranes.</p><p>Three ras genes, designated H-ras, K-ras, and M-ras, have been identified in the mammalian genome. Mammalian ras genes acquire transformation-inducing properties by single point mutations within their coding sequences. Mutations in naturally occurring ras oncogenes have been localized to codons 12, 13, and 61. The most commonly detected activating ras mutation found in human tumors is in codon 12 of the H-ras gene in which a base change from GGC to GTC results in a glycine-to-valine substitution in the GTPase regulatory domain of the ras protein product. This single amino acid change is thought to abolish normal control of ras protein function, thereby converting a normally regulated cell protein to one that is continuously active. It is believed that such deregulation of normal ras protein function is responsible for the transformation from normal to malignant growth.</p><p>While for illustrative purposes, the compounds of the invention are targeted to ras RNA, it is of course recognized that a host of other RNAs also are suitable as the target RNA. Thus the compounds of the invention can be used to modulate the expression of any suitable target RNA that is naturally present in cells or any target RNA in vitro.</p><p>The ras target site utilized for illustrative purposes is one the most RNase H sensitive oligonucleotide sites that has been identified in the literature. The selective inhibition of mutated genes such as the ras oncogene necessitates hybridization of a regulatory compound in the coding region of the mRNA. This requires either a high affinity interaction between such a compound and ras mRNA to prevent displacement of the compound by the polysome, or rapid degradation of the target mRNA by a given terminating mechanism. Again while not wishing to be bound by theory, the RNA like compounds of the invention, have both inherently high affinity and are able to take advantage of the cellular dsRNase activity.</p><p>In accordance with the objects of this invention, novel oligomeric compounds that bind to a target RNA strand and that are substrates for dsRNase enzymes are provided. The oligomeric compounds of the invention include oligoribonucleotides, oligoribonucleosides and other oligomeric compounds having a linear sequence of linked ribonucleoside subunits incorporated therein. Such other oligomeric compounds will include chimeric structures formed between PNA (peptide nucleic acid) segments and linked ribonucleosides. Thus for the purposes of this specification, the term "oligomeric compound" is meant to be inclusive of the terms oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides, either used singly or in combination, as well as other oligomeric compounds including chimeric compounds formed between PNA segments (and other surrogate nucleoside components) and linked ribonucleoside segments. As used in this specification and the claims attached hereto, in one sense the term oligomeric compound is used to represent oligoribonucleotides, in a further sense to represent oligoribonucleosides, in even a further sense to represent mixtures of oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides and in other instances to indicated further chimeric compounds such as the above identified PNA chimeric compounds.</p><p>The oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides of the invention are assembled from a plurality of nucleoside subunits. In certain preferred oligoribonucleotide or oligoribonucleosides of the invention at least one of the nucleoside subunits bear a substituent group that increases the binding affinity of the oligoribonucleotide or oligoribonucleoside for a complementary strand of nucleic acid. Additionally, at least some of the nucleoside subunits comprise 2'-hydroxyl-pentofuranosyl sugar moieties.</p><p>For cellular use, for an oligonucleotide to be particularly useful, the oligonucleotide must be reasonably stable to nucleases in order to survive in cells for a time period sufficient for it to interact with target nucleic acids of the cells. Therefore, in certain embodiments of the invention, specific nucleoside subunits or internucleoside linkages are functionalized or selected to increase the nuclease resistance of the oligoribonucleotide or oligoribonucleoside. However, for non-cellular uses, such as use of oligomeric compounds of the invention as research reagents and as diagnostic agents, such nuclease stability may not be necessary.</p><p>In determining the extent of binding affinity of a first nucleic acid to a complementary nucleic acid, the relative ability of the first nucleic acid to bind to the complementary nucleic acid may be compared by determining the melting temperature of a particular hybridization complex.</p><p>The melting temperature (T.sub.m), a characteristic physical property of double stranded nucleotides, denotes the temperature (in degrees centigrade) at which 50% helical (hybridized) versus coil (unhybridized) forms are present. T.sub.m is measured by using the UV spectrum to determine the formation and breakdown (melting) of the hybridization complex. Base stacking which occurs during hybridization is accompanied by a reduction in UV absorption (hypochromicity). Consequently, a reduction in UV absorption indicates a higher T.sub.m. The higher the T.sub.m, the greater the strength of the bonds between the strands.</p><p>It has been found in the present invention that the binding affinity of oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonuceosides of the present invention can be increased by incorporating substituent groups in the nucleoside subunits of these compounds. Preferred substituent groups are 2'substituent groups, i.e. substituent groups located at the 2'position of the pentofuranosyl sugar moieties of the nucleoside subunits of the compounds of the present invention. Presently preferred substituent groups include fluoro, alkoxy, aminoalkoxy, allyloxy, imidazolylalkoxy and polyethylene glycol. Alkoxy and aminoalkoxy groups generally include lower alkyl groups, particularly C.sub.1 -C.sub.9 alkyl. Polyethylene glycols are of the structure (O--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2).sub.n --O-alkyl. A particularly preferred substituent group is a polyethylene glycol substituent of the formula (--O--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2).sub.n --O-alkyl, wherein n=1 and alkyl=CH.sub.3. This modification has been shown to increase both affinity of a oligonucleotide for its target and nuclease resistance c)f an oligonucleotide.</p><p>A further particularly useful 2'-substituent group for increasing the binding affinity is the 2'-fluoro group.</p><p>In a published study (Synthesis and Biophysical Studies of 2'-dRIBO-F Modified Oligonucleotides, Conference On Nucleic Acid Therapeutics, Clearwater, Fla., Jan. 13, 1991) an increase in binding affinity of 1.6.degree. C. per substituted nucleoside subunit was reported for a 15-mer phosphodiester oligonucleotide having 2'-fluoro substituent groups on five of the nucleoside subunits of the oligonucleotide. When 11 of the nucleoside subunits of the oligonucleotide bore 2'-fluoro substituent groups, the binding affinity increased to 1.8.degree. C. per substituted nucleoside subunit. In this study, the 15-mer phosphodiester oligonucleotide was derivatized to the corresponding phosphorothioate analog. When the 15-mer phosphodiester</p><p>oligonucleotide was compared to its phosphorothioate analog, the phosphorothioate analog had a binding affinity of only about 66% of that of the 15-mer phosphodiester oligonucleotide. Stated otherwise, binding affinity was lost in derivatizing the oligonucleotide to its phosphorothioate analog. However, when 2'-fluoro substituents were located on 11 of the nucleosides subunits of the 15-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, the binding affinity of the 2'-substituent groups more than overcame the decrease noted by derivatizing the 15-mer oligonucleotide to its phosphorothioate analog. In this compound, i.e. the 15-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide having 11 nucleoside subunits substituted with 2'-fluoro substituent groups, the binding affinity was increased to 2.5.degree. C. per substituent group.</p><p>For use in preparing the nucleoside structural subunits of the compounds of the invention, suitable nucleobases for incorporation in these nucleoside subunits include purines and pyrimidines such as adenine, guanine, cytosine, uridine, and thymine, as well as other synthetic and natural nucleobases such as xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, amino, thiol, thioalkyl, hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine. Further purines and pyrimidines include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808, those disclosed in the Concise Encyclopedia Of Polymer Science And Engineering, pages 858-859, Kroschwitz, J. I., ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1990, and those disclosed by Englisch et: al., Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1991, 30, 613.</p><p>Certain of these nucleobases are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of the oligomeric compounds of the invention. These include 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and O-6 substituted purines, including 2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine. Other modified pyrimidine and purine bases are also expected to increase the binding affinity of oligomeric compounds to a complementary strand of nucleic acid.</p><p>Preferred oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides in accordance with this invention preferably comprise from about 5 to about 50 nucleoside subunits. In the context of this invention it is understood that this encompasses non-naturally occurring oligomers as hereinbefore described, having 5 to 50 nucleoside subunits. It is more preferred that the oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides of the present invention comprise from about 15 to about 25 nucleoside subunits. As will be appreciated, a "nucleoside subunit" is a nucleobase and sugar or sugar surrogate combination suitably bound to adjacent subunits through phosphorus linkages in oligoribonucleotides and through non-phosphorus linkages in oligoribonucleosides. In this context, the term "nucleoside subunit" is used interchangeably with the term "nucleoside unit" or "nucleoside."</p><p>The oligoribonucleotides of the invention have their nucleoside subunits connected by phosphorus linkages including phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, 3'-(or -5')deoxy-3'-(or -5')thio-phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenates, 3'-(or -5')deoxy phosphinates, borano phosphates, 3'-(or -5')deoxy-3'-(or 5'-)amino phosphoramidates, hydrogen phosphonates, borano phosphate esters, phosphoramidates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates and phosphotriester phosphorus linkages.</p><p>Whereas the oligoribonucleosides of the invention have their nucleoside subunits connected by carbonate, carbamate, silyl, sulfur, sulfonate, sulfonamide, formacetal, thioformacetyl, oxime, methyleneimino, methylenemethylimino, methylenehydrazo, methylenedimethylhydrazo and methyleneoxymethylimino linkages.</p><p>In order to elicit a dsRNase response within the total overall sequence length of the oligomeric compounds of the invention there will be a segment or subsequence of greaten than three, but preferably, four, five or more consecutively linked 2'-hydroxyl-pentofuranosyl-containing nucleoside subunits. It is presently preferred to incorporate the 2'-hydroxyl-pentofuranosyl-containing nucleoside subsequence in the oligomeric compound such that further subsequences or segments of oligomeric compound are located on either side of the 2'-hydroxyl-pentofuranosyl-containing nucleoside subsequence. In such a construction, the 2'-hydroxyl-pentofuranosyl containing nucleoside subsequence is also referred to as the "central" or "gap" region or segment and the other nucleoside subsequences or segments are referred to as "flanking" or "wing" regions or segments. Thus the "flap" region is flanked on either side by "wings." Other constructions are also possible, including locating the 2'-hydroxylpentofuranosyl containing nucleoside subsequence at either the 3' or the 5' terminus of the oligomeric compound of the invention. These other constructions can be considered as "open" gapped structures, i.e., the gap region is open on the end (either 3' or 5' end) of the oligomeric compound.</p><p>The oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis, see for example "Oligonucleotide synthesis, a practical approach", Ed.

Various amidite reagents are also commercially available, including 2'-O-methyl amidites and 2'-O-hydroxyl amidites. Any other means for such synthesis may also be employed. The actual synthesis of the oligonucleotides is well within the talents of those skilled in the art. It is also well known to use similar techniques to prepare other oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives. It is also well known to use similar techniques and commercially available modified amidites and controlled-pore glass (CPG) products such as biotin, fluorescein, acridine or psoralen-modified amidites and/or CPG (available from Glen Research, Sterling Va.) to synthesize fluorescently labeled, biotinylated or other conjugated oligonucleotides.</p><p>In a further embodiment, the present invention is drawn to a mammalian ribonuclease isolatable from human T24 cells, and other cell lines, that degrades RNA in an antisense oligoribonucleotide:RNA duplex. The ribonuclease is referred to herein as a dsRNase, wherein "ds" indicates the RNase's specificity for double-stranded RNA substrates. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides containing 2'-methoxy modified sugar moieties bind to their cellular mRNA targets with high affinity but the resulting ["DNA-like"]:[RNA] duplexes are not substrates for nucleolytic degradation in T24 cells. As detailed in the Examples, 2'-methoxy phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides targeting codon 12 of Ha-Ras mRNA were modified by substituting 2'-methoxy nucleotides with a stretch of ribonucleotides in the center of the oligonucleotide to form 2'-methoxy/ribo/2'-methoxy chimeric or "gapmer" oligonucleotides, with the phosphorothioate linkage maintained throughout the molecules. These "RNA-like" gapmer oligonucleotides bind to their cellular mRNA target with an affinity comparable to that of the full 2-meothoxy oligodeoxynucleotide, but, unlike the ["DNA-like"]:[RNA] duplexes, the resultant ["RNA-like"]-[RNA] duplexes are substrates for nucleolytic degradation in T24 cells.</p><p>Degradation of the [antisense "RNA-like" gapmer oligonucleotide]:[Ha-Ras mRNA] duplex is dependent on She number of ribonucleotides incorporated into the antisense molecule. A 17 base pair 9 RNA gapmer oligonucleotide:RNA duplex is not a substrate for RNase H cleavage, but is a substrate for cleavage by an the dsRNase of the invention in T24 cellular lysates. Furthermore, the cleavage sites seen with T24 cellular lysates are localized to the RNA:RNA portion of the duplex and are not seen in the 2-methoxy:RNA portion of the duplex. Cleavage of the duplex by the dsRNase of the invention produces 5'-phosphate and 3-hydroxyl termini.</p><p>Compounds of the invention can be utilized as diagnostics, therapeutics and as research reagents and kits. They can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by adding an effective amount of a compound of the invention to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. They further can be used for treating organisms having a disease characterized by the undesired production of a protein. The organism can be contacted with a compound of the invention having a sequence that is capable of specifically hybridizing with a strand of target nucleic acid that codes for the undesirable protein.</p><p>The formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration is believed to be within the skill of those in the art. In general, for therapeutics, a patient in need of such therapy is administered a compound in accordance with the invention, commonly in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, in doses ranging from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight depending on the age of the patient and the severity of the disease state being treated. Further, the treatment regimen may last for a period of time which will vary depending upon the nature of the particular disease, its severity and the overall condition of the patient, and may extend from once daily to once every 20 years. Following treatment, the patient is monitored for changes in his/her condition and for alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state. The dosage of the compound may either be increased in the event the patient does not respond significantly to current dosage levels, or the dose may be decreased if an alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state is observed, or if the disease state has been ablated.</p><p>In some cases it may be more effective to treat a patient with a compound of the invention in conjunction with other traditional therapeutic modalities. For example, a patient being treated for a viral disease may be administered a compound of the invention in conjunction with a known antiviral agent, or a patient with atherosclerosis may be treated with a compound of the invention following angioplasty to prevent reocclusion of the treated arteries.</p><p>Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the compound of the invention is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily, to once every 20 years.</p><p>The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic, vaginal, rectal, intranasal, transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, or intrathecal or intraventricular administration.</p><p>Formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful. Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets or tablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable.</p><p>Compositions for intrathecal or intraventricular administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives.</p><p>Formulations for parenteral administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives.</p><p>Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease condition to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual compounds, and can generally be estimated based on EC.sub.50 s found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years.</p><p>Such treatment can be practiced in a variety of organisms ranging from unicellular prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to multicellular eukaryotic organisms. Any organism that utilizes DNA-RNA transcription or RNA-protein translation as a fundamental part of its hereditary, metabolic or cellular machinery is susceptible to such diagnostic, therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment. Seemingly diverse organisms such as bacteria, yeast, protozoa, algae, plant and higher animal forms, including warm-blooded animals, can be treated in this manner. Further, since each of the cells of multicellular eukaryotes also includes both DNA-RNA transcription and RNA-protein translation as an integral part of their cellular 3S activity, such therapeutics and/or diagnostics can also be practiced on such cellular populations. Furthermore, many of the organelles, e.g. mitochondria and chloroplasts, of eukaryotic cells also include transcription and translation mechanisms. As such, single cells, cellular populations or organelles also can be included within the definition of organisms that are capable of being treated with the therapeutic or diagnostic compounds of the invention. As used herein, therapeutics is meant to include eradication of a disease state, killing of an organism, e.g. bacterial, protozoan or other infection, or control of aberrant or undesirable cellular growth or expression.</p><p>In the context of this invention, "target RNA" shall mean any RNA that can hybridize with a complementary nucleic acid like compound. Further in the context of this invention, "hybridization" shall mean hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleobases. "Complementary" as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleobases. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. "Complementary" and "specifically hybridizable," as used herein, refer to precise pairing or sequence complementarity between a first and a second nucleic acid-like oligomers containing nucleoside subunits. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of the first nucleic acid is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at the same position of the second nucleic acid, then the first nucleic acid and the second nucleic acid are considered to be complementary to each other at that position. The first and second nucleic acids are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, "specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between a compound of the invention and a target RNA molecule. It is understood that an oligomeric compound of the invention need not be 100% complementary to its target RNA sequence tc be specifically hybridizable. An oligomeric compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligomeric compound to the target RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target RNA to cause a loss of utility, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligomeric compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e. under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed.</p><p>The following examples and procedures illustrate the present invention and are not intended to limit the same.

These include a first type wherein the "gap" segment of linked nucleosides is positioned between 5' and 3' "wing" segments of linked nucleosides and a second "open end" type wherein the "gap" segment is located at either the 3' or the 5' terminus of the oligomeric compound. In the illustrative examples, for all chimeric oligoribonucleotides and oligoribonucleosides, unless otherwise indicated, 2'-O-methyl nucleosides are utilized in the "wing" segments and 2'-OH nucleosides are utilized in the "gap" segments of the respective oligoribonucleotides or oligoribonucleosides.</p><p>For the purposes of the illustrative examples the following short hand conventions are used. Structure set forth in brackets, i.e. [ ], are nucleoside abbreviations, while structures set forth following a slash mark, i.e. /, are linkers used to connect the nucleosides, i.e. backbone structures that link the nucleosides together in either oligoribonucleotide or oligoribonucleoside compounds.</p><p>Using this nomenclature, the following abbreviations are used for phosphate linkages between nucleosides: PO for phosphodiester; PS for phosphorothioate, P2S for phosphorodithioate, PSe for phosphoroselenates, PMe for methyl phosphonate, POMe for methyl phosphotriester, PN for phosphoramidate, 3'NPN for 3'-deoxy-3'-amino phosphoramidate, PI for phosphinate, MePS for alkylphosphonothioate, BP for borano phosphate are used. For non-phosphate linkages between nucleosides the abbreviations used are: MMI for methylenemethylimino, MDH for methylenedimethylhydrazo, Fit for formacetal, TFA for thioformacetal, ETO for ethylene oxide and amide-3 for methylenecarbonylamino. 2'-OH is utilized as an abbreviation for unmodified ribo sugars, i.e. pentoribofuranosyl sugars. For modified nucleosides the abbreviation's used are: 2'-O-alkyl for general alkyl groups at the 21 position of a pentoribofuranosyl moiety with specific alkyl being noted as 2'-O-Me, 2'-O-Et, 2'-O-Pr and 2'-O-EtOMe for methyl, ethyl, propyl and methoxyethyl, respectively; 2'-F for a fluoro moiety at the 2' position of a pentoribofuranosyl moiety, Mod-Purine for a purine nucleobase substitution as, for example, per the disclosure of U.S. Pat.

The oligoribonucleotides were melted by heating to 95 temperature in 2 liters bath of water 90 confirmed by the shift in mobility between the single stranded end labeled sense RNA and the annealed duplex on non denaturing polyacrylamide gels.

T24 cell nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated as described previously (Szyf, M., Bozovic, V., and Tanigawa, G., J. Biol. Chem., 1991, 266, 10027-10030).

The precipitates were then treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene) and .sup.32 P-γ-ATP (ICN, Irvine, Calif.). The samples were again extracted by phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, the products of the reaction were then resolved on a 12% acrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to XAR film. The 3'-terminus of the cleaved duplex was evaluated by the reaction of duplex digestion products with T4 RNA ligase (Stratagene) and .sup.32 P-pCp (ICN).</p><heading>EXAMPLE 22</heading><p>Chimeric 2'-methoxy oligoribonucleotides mediate digestion of target RNA in T24 cells</p><p>Structure activity analyses of antisense oligonucleotides specific for codon 12 of the Ha-ras oncogene containing various 2'-sugar modifications were reported by Monia, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1992, 267, 19954-19962 and Monia et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1993, 268, 14514-14522. In those reports, although the 2'-modified oligonucleotides hybridized with greater affinity to RNA than did unmodified 2'-deoxy oligos they were completely ineffective in inhibiting Ha-ras gene expression. The lack of activity observed with these 2'-modified oligos was directly attributed to their inability to create duplexes that could serve as substrates for degradation by RNase H. Following a similar protocol, stretches of ribonucleotides were introduced into the center of 17 base 2'-methoxy oligoribonucleotides targeting Ha-ras mRNA to form 2'-methoxy-2'-hydorxy-2'-methoxy phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotide "gapped" chimeric compounds that have varying ribonucleotide content in the central gap segment (see FIG. 1 for a representation of these compounds as well as their base sequence). When hybridized to their cellular target the resultant duplex consists of two stretches that are not targets for nucleolytic degradation (the 2'-methoxy "wings") and one 2'-hydroxyl oligoribonucleotide stretch that was found to be a target for a novel ribonuclease activity that recognizes RNA:RNA duplexes. T24 human bladder carcinoma cells were used that contain an activating G-T transversion mutation in the Ha-ras gene at the codon 12 position. The "gapped" chimeric compounds specific for this mutation were transfected into T24 cells growing in culture. After incubation with the compounds for 24 hrs, cells were harvested, total cytosolic RNA isolated and Northern blot analysis for Ha-ras mRNA levels performed. Fully modified 2'-methoxy oligonucleotides did not support nucleolytic cleavage of target mRNA and therefore did not lead to a reduction in steady state levels of Ha-ras mRNA even at the highest concentration tested (FIGS. 2A and 2B). An RNA gapmer oligonucleotide with only 3 ribonucleotides in the gap was also incapable of inducing nucleolytic cleavage of the target RNA (FIGS. 2C and 2D). However, T24 cells treated with RNA gapmer oligonucleotides containing 5, 7 and 9 ribonucleotides in the gap as well as a full phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotide molecule all displayed dose dependent reductions in Ha-ras steady state mRNA levels (FIGS. 3B-3D). T24 cells treated with a control 9 RNA gapmer oligonucleotide that contained four mismatched bases in its sequence did not show dose dependent reduction in Ha-ras mRNA suggesting that hybridization to the target RNA is essential for activity (FIG. 3E). The RNA gapmer compounds showed dose dependent inhibition of Ha-ras steady state mRNA levels.</p><p>The ability of the RNA gapmer compounds to reduce Ha-ras mRNA was dependent on the size of the RNA gap and thus the size of the RNA:RNA duplex formed in vivo. Treatment of cells with the 3 base RNA gapmer compounds resulted in no cleavage of the target whereas the 5, 7 and 9 base RNA gapmer compounds resulted in reduction in Ha-ras mRNA (FIG. 4). The fact that the RNA gapmer oligonucleotide containing 3 ribonucleotides in the gap was unable to induce reduction in target mRNA suggests that the activity involved requires a minimal RNA:RNA duplex region of at least four ribonucleotides for binding and cleavage of the target. Interestingly, chimeric DNA gapmer oligonucleotides that contain deoxynucleotides in the gap instead of ribonucleotides show the same minimal gap size requirements to form substrates for RNase H mediated degradation of the target mRNA (Crooke et al., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol., 1996, 36, 107), suggesting that RNase H and the double stranded RNase activity described here may share some properties, although their substrates are clearly different.</p><p>A control 9 RNA gapmer compound that contains four mismatched bases in its sequence resulted in essentially no reduction in Ha-ras mRNA as expected as is shown in FIG. 3E. A full phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotide molecule had approximately the same activity as the 5 RNA gapmer oligo (FIG. 3D). This might have been due to the relative decrease in stability of the full oligoribonucleotide in vivo resulting from inactivation by single stranded ribonucleases, as 2'-methoxy phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides are considerably more stable than phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotides. Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 1996, 277, 923-937. Treatment of T24 cells with the various oligonucleotides and various concentrations up to 800 nM was done in triplicate and quantification of Ha-ras mRNA levels indicate that at 600 nM the 5 gapmer reduces Ha-ras mRNA by 51%, the 7 gapmer by 49%, the 9 gapmer by 77% and the full ribonucleotide by 38% when compared to non treated controls. This suggests that RNA gapmer oligoribonucleotides protected by 2'-methoxy wings would be more potent molecules. As shown in this example, an endoribonuclease activity in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells recognizes the internal RNA:oligoribonucleotide portion of a chimeric duplex and reduced the target mRNA levels.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 23</heading><p>An activity present in T24 cellular extracts induces cleavage of gapmer oligoribonucleotide:RNA duplex within the internal RNA:RNA portion in vitro</p><p>To further characterize the double-stranded RNA cleavage activity in T24 cells, T24 cellular extracts were prepared and tested for the ability to cleave the 9 gap oligoribonucleotide:RNA duplex in vitro. The 9 gap compound:.sup.32 P-end labeled RNA duplex was incubated with 3 μg of cytosolic extract at 37 FIG. 4, followed by phenol chloroform extraction ethanol precipitation and separation of the products on a denaturing gel. That this duplex was a substrate for digestion by an activity present in T24 extracts is shown by the loss of full length end labeled RNA and the appearance of lower molecular weight digestion products indicated by arrows in FIG. 4. In addition, the activity responsible for the cleavage of the duplex has specificity for the RNA:RNA portion of the duplex molecule, as indicated by the sizes of the cleavage products it produces (see the physical map of the .sup.32 P-end labeled RNA, far right in FIG. 4. RNase H cleavage of a 9 deoxynucleotide gap oligonucleotide:RNA duplex and cleavage of the 9 ribonucleotide gap oligoribonucleotide:RNA duplex by T24 cellular extracts appears to result in similar digestion products. This is seen by comparing the gels of FIGS. 4 and 5. Both activities displayed preferred cleavage sites near the 3' end of the target RNA in their respective duplexes which suggests that they may share binding as well as mechanistic properties. Cellular extracts prepared from human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVEC), human lung carcinoma (A549) and Hela cell lines all contained an activity able to induce cleavage of the 9 RNA gapmer:RNA target duplex in vitro.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 24</heading><p>Cleavage of target RNA in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of cell products</p><p>The cellular distribution of the double stranded RNase activity described herein was further evaluated. Nuclear extracts were prepared from T24 cells and tested for the ability to digest the 9 RNA gapmer oligonucleotide:RNA duplex. Nuclear extracts prepared from T24 cells were able to degrade the target duplex, and the activity was found to be present in the nuclear fraction at comparable levels to that in the cytoplasmic fractions.</p><p>An RNA gapmer oligonucleotide was synthesized that contained phosphorothioate linkages throughout the entire length of the molecule. Since this results in increased stability to single stranded nucleases, it was reasoned that it would inhibit cleavage of the antisense strand by the dsRNase as well. Therefore, to determine if the activity described above can cleave both strands in a RNA duplex molecule, a 9 RNA gapmer antisense oligonucleotide that contained phosphorothioate linkages in the wings between the 2' methoxy nucleotides but had phosphodiester linkages between the nine ribonucleotides in the gap was synthesized. A duplex composed of this .sup.32 P-labeled 9 RNA gapmer phosphodiester/phosphorothioate oligonucleotide and its complementary oligoribonucleotide was tested as a substrate for double stranded RNase activity in T24 extracts. The activity was capable of cleaving the antisense strand of this duplex as well as the sense strand and the pattern of the digestion products indicated that cleavage was again restricted to the RNA:RNA phosphodiester portion of the duplex.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 25</heading><p>An RNA Gapmer oligonucleotide:RNA duplex is not a substrate for RNase H</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the cleavage shown in Example 23 might be due to RNase H, the ability of E. coli RNase H to cleave a 17 base pair duplex of the 9 gapmer oligoribonucleotide and its complementary 5' .sup.32 P-labeled RNA in vitro was tested. FIG. 5 shows the expected shift in electrophoretic mobility when duplexes were formed and analyzed on a native gel next to the single stranded .sup.32 P-end labeled RNA. As can be seen in FIG. 5 in the far right panel, the 9 Gapmer oligoribonucleotide:RNA duplex was not a substrate for RNase H cleavage as no lower molecular weight bands appeared when it was treated with RNase H. However, as expected a full deoxy oligonucleotide:RNA duplex was cleaved by RNase H under the same conditions, as is evident by the appearance of lower molecular species in the enzyme treated lane (FIG. 5, left panel). A duplex composed of a 9 gapmer DNA oligonucleotide and its complementary RNA was a substrate for RNase H cleavage. The fact that the RNase H cleavage sites in this particular duplex were localized to the DNA:RNA portions of the duplex further demonstrates that the RNA gapmer oligoribonucleotide:RNA duplex is not a substrate for RNase H digestion.</p><p>It is interesting to note that RNase H cleavage of the 9 DNA gapmer oligonucleotide:RNA duplex (FIG. 5, left panel) and cleavage of the 9 RNA gapmer oligonucleotide:RNA duplex by T24 cellular extracts resulted in similar digestion products (see FIG. 4). Both RNase H and the activity in T24 cells displayed the same preferred cleavage sites on their respective duplexes. Moreover, at this site, both the oligonucleotides were roughly comparable in potency. Cleavage was restricted to the 3' end of the target RNA in the region opposite either the DNA or RNA gap of the respective antisense molecule.</p><p>While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the immediately preceding result suggests that RNase H and the dsRNase of the invention may share binding as well as mechanistic properties. However, analysis of DNA and RNA gapmer oligonucleotides targeting four sites on c-Raf mRNA revealed that RNase H and the dsRNase activity described here clearly have different substrate specificities. "RNA-like" gapmer oligonucleotides targeted to the c-Raf mRNA were not able to induce reduction in mRNA whereas RNase H active oligodeoxynucleotides targeted to the same site were able to reduce target mRNA levels. To determine if the lack of cleavage induced by the four c-Raf "RNA gapmers" in T24 cells was due to possible sequence specificity or cleavage, the four c-Raf "RNA-like gapmers," the ras "RNA-like gapmer" and the corresponding "DNA-like gapmers" were prehybridized to .sup.32 P-labeled target oligoribonucleotides and incubated with T24 homogenates. The ras "RNA-like gapmer" supported cleavage of the ras target RNA almost as efficiently as the "DNA gapmer." However, only one of the "RNA-like gapmers" targeted to c-Raf segments (SEQ ID NO:8) supported any cleavage and the rate of cleavage for the "RNA-like gapmer" was much slower than the comparable "DNA-like gapmer." Thus, in contrast to RNase H, the dsRNase displays considerable sequence specificity.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 26</heading><p>Nuclease activity generates 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini</p><p>To determine the nature of the 5' termini left by nuclease cleavage of the duplex in vitro, non-labeled duplex was incubated with T24 cellular extracts as previously described then reacted with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [.sup.32 P-γ-ATP] with or without prior treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment of the duplex products was seen to be essential for the incorporation of .sup.32 P label during the reaction with polynucleotide kinase, indicating the presence of a phosphate group at the 5' termini. The 3' termini were evaluated by the reaction of duplex digestion products with T4 RNA ligase and .sup.32 P-pCp. T4 RNA ligase requires a free 3'-hydroxyl terminus for the ligation of .sup.32 P-pCp. The ability of the duplex digestion products to incorporate .sup.32 P-pCp by T4 RNA ligase indicates the presence of 3'-hydroxyl groups.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 27</heading><p>Purification and characterization of double-stranded ribonucleases from mamallian tissues</p><p>In order to determine if mamallian cells, other than cultured cell lines, contain double-strand RNase activity, and to provide a source from which such ribonucleases might be purified, the following efforts were undertaken to identify and purify dsRNases from rat liver homogenates.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 27-a</heading><p>Substrates and assays for dsRNases</p><p>In preliminary experiments, double-strand RNase activity was observed in rat liver homogenates, but the homogenates also displayed high levels of single-strand RNases that complicated analysis of the dsRNase activities because of cleavage of the oligoribonucleotide overhangs after cleavage by the dsRNases. To solve this problem, two additional substrates and a non-denaturing gel assay were used. The "sense" strand was an oligoribonucleotide having phosphodiester linkages in an eight-base gap with flanks having either (a) residues with phosphorothioate linkages or (b) 2'-methoxynucleosides with phosphorothioate linkages. The "antisense" strand in both substrates contained 2'-methoxy phosphorothioate wings on either side of an eight-base ribonucleotide gap having either phosphodiester or phosphorothioate linkages (Table 1). Such dsRNase substrates were more stable to exonuclease digestion than an oligoribonucleotide and substrates with both phosphorothioate linkages and 2'-methoxy nucleosides was extremely stable. These features are important because of the abundance of single-strand RNases relative to the double-strand RNase activity in the rat liver and supported the use of non-denaturing assays.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 1______________________________________Artificial Substrates for Mamallian dsRNases*______________________________________Ha-ras TARGETED SENSE/ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES    SEQ ID NO: 1           5'-GGG CGC CGU CGG UGU GG-3'  SEQ ID NO: 2 3'-CCC GCG GCA GCC ACA CC-5'C-raf TARGETED SENSE/ANTISENSE OLGONUCLEOTIDES    SEQ ID NO: 3           5'-CCG AAU GUG ACC GCC UCC CG-5'  SEQ ID NO: 4 3'-GGC UUA CAC UGG CGG AGG GC-3'  SEQ ID NO: 5 5'-UCA AUG GAG CAC AUA CAG GG-3'  SEQ ID NO: 6 3'-AGU UAC CUC GUG UAU GUC CC-5'  SEQ ID NO: 7 5'-AAU GCA UGU CAC AGG CGG GA-3'  SEQ ID NO: 8 3'-UUA CGU ACA GUG UCC GCC CU-5'______________________________________ *Emboldened residues indicate 2methoxynucleotide residues in the "antisense" strands.</pre></p><p>Both rat liver cytosolic and nuclear extracts induced cleavage of the duplex substrate.

A double-strand RNase, RNase V1 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) cleaved the substrate; T24 extracts also cleaved the substrate. Neither bacterial nor single-strand RNase cleaved the substrate, with the exception of RNase A, which at very high concentrations resulted in some cleavage.

Hydrophobic interaction columns (HICs) have been used to purify ribonuclease A from undesired contaminants (Wu et al., Methods in Enzymology, 1996, 270, 27; Wetlaufer et al., J. Chromatography, 1986, 359, 55).</p><p>The dsRNases of the invention may also be further purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography (Kennedy, Methods in Enzymology, 1990, 182, 339). Endo- and exo-ribonuclease have been purified from Trypanosoma brucei using hydroxyapatile chromatography (Gbenle, Exp. Parisitol., 1990, 71, 432; Gbenles, Mol. Biochem. Parasitol., 1985, 15, 37).</p><p>RNA affinity columns may also be used to further purify the dsRNases of the invention. In particular, a commercially available double-stranded RNA affinity column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) may be used. Alternatively, a column is prepared in which the matrix thereof comprises one or more of the dsRNase substrates of the invention (for details, see the following Example). Due to the relative sequence specificity of the dsRNase of the present invention, the latter type of affinity column may be preferable. In order to prevent degradation of the matrix of either type of double-stranded affinity matrix, samples comprising the dsRNases of the invention are treated in such a manner so as to limit the degradative capacity of the dsRNase without significantly altering its ability to bind to the double-stranded RNA substrate of the matrix. For example, the degradative activity of the dsRNase of the invention is inhibited in solutions lacking available Mg.sup.++  due to, for example, the addition of appropriate chelating agents such as EDTA, or by addition of NaCl to a sample containing such dsRNases to a final concentration of at least 300 mM (see the following subsection).</p><p>Those skilled in the art will recognize that the above means, as well as others not herein described, will need to be optimized for optimal efficiency in purifying the dsRNases of the invention. For example, the selection of one or more of the above means as a further purification step, and of the order in which such means are applied, will effect the degree of purity and specific activity of the dsRNase so treated. However, such optimization is believed to be within the skill of the art given that the assays described herein can be readily utilized by a skilled artisan to determine the effect of further purification steps on the activity of the desired dsRNase. Other techniques known in the art, such as SDS-PAGE, can be used to determine the purity of samples subjected to the above purification means.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 27-c</heading><p>Characterization of purified mammalian dsRNases</p><p>The effects of various conditions on the dsRNase activity were evaluated using the active fractions after ion exchange chromatography. The dsRNase activity was demonstrable in Tris or phosphate buffers from about pH 7 to about pH 10. The dsRNase activity was not stable in solution in acetonitrile or methanol. Furthermore, the activity was inhibited by NaCl; dsRNase activity was inhibited by 30% at 10 mM NaCl, &amp;gt;60% at 100 mM NaCl and 100% at 300 mM NaCl. Heating for five minutes at 60 80 was seen in the temperature range of about 37 42 of that observed at 37 10, 20 and 50 mM EDTA, but not at 5 mM, in agreement with its requirement for Mg.sup.++, and was stable to multiple freeze/thaws.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 28</heading><p>Further characterization of the dsRNase cleavage site using purified rat dsRNase</p><p>The purified dsRNases were used to characterize the site of cleavage in more detail. Because it was necessary to minimize any single-strand cleavage from occurring after endonuclease cleavage and during handling, particularly after denaturing of the duplex. Consequently, the most stable duplex substrate, i.e., one in which both strands of the duplex contained flanking regions comprised of 2' methoxy nucleosides and phosphorothioate linkages was used.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 28-a</heading><p>.sup.32 P labeling of oligonucleotides</p><p>The sense oligonucleotide was 5'-end labeled with .sup.32 P using [g.sup.32 P]ATP, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and standard procedures (Ausubel et al., 1989). The labeled oligonucleotide was purified by electrophoresis on 12% denaturing PAGE (Sambrook et al., 1989). The specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide was approximately 5000 cpm/fmol.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 28-b</heading><p>Double-strand RNA digestion assay</p><p>Oligonucleotide duplexes were prepared in 30 uL reaction buffer [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl.sub.2, 0.1 mM DTT] containing 10 nM antisense oligonucleotide and 10.sup.5 cpm .sup.32 P labeled sense oligonucleotide. Reactions were heated at 90 incubated at 37 incubated in either unpurified and semipurified cellular extracts at a total protein concentration of 75 ug unpurified cytosolic extract, 60 ug unpurified nuclear extract, 5 ug ion exchange purified cytosolic fraction, 5 ug ion exchange purified nuclear fraction, or 0.5 ug ion exchange and gel filtration purified nuclear fraction. Digestion reactions were incubated at 37 each reaction was removed and quenched by addition of denaturing gel loading buffer [5 uL 8 M urea, 0.25% xylene cyanole FF, 0.25% bromphenol blue]. The reactions were heated at 95 in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The remaining aliquot was quenched in 2 uL native gel loading buffer [glycerol, 0.25% xylene cyanole FF. The reactions were resolved at 10 gel containing 44 mM Tris-borate and 1 mM MgCl.sub.2. Gels were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager.</p><p>FIG. 7 displays the native gel results.

In the remaining lanes, the results of treatment of dsRNAse substrates with 0.02 (lane 3) and 0.002 (lane 4) units of RNase V1, unpurified nuclear extract for 0 minutes (lane 5) or 240 minutes (lane 6), unpurified nuclear extract for 240 minutes without Mg.sup.++  (lane 7), unpurified cytosolic extract for 240 minutes (lane 8), ion exchange purified cytosolic extract for 240 minutes in the presence (lane 9) or absence (lane 10) of Mg.sup.++, and ion exchange/gel filtration purified cytosolic extract for 240 minutes in the presence (lane 9) or absence (lane 10) of Mg.sup.++ are shown.</p><p>FIG. 8 shows the results of analysis of products of digestion of dsRNAse substrates by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lane 1 shows "sense" strand RNA treated with 5 lane 2 shows "sense" strand RNA treated with 0.02 units RNase V1. The remaining lanes show dsRNAse products treated with 0.02 (lane 3) and 0.002 (lane 4) units of RNase V1, with unpurified nuclear extract for 0 minutes (lane 5) or 240 minutes (lane 6), with unpurified cytosolic extract for 240 minutes (lane 7), with ion exchange purified cytosolic extract for 240 minutes (lane 8), and with ion exchange/gel filtration purified cytosolic extract for 240 minutes (lane 9). Lane 10 is an RNA base hydrolysis ladder included for sizing purpose. RNase V1 digestion of the single-strand substrate resulted in little degradation (lane 2). RNase V1 digestion of the duplex resulted in degradates reflecting cleavage at several sites within the gap (lanes 3 and 4). In lanes 4-9, the band at the top of the gel demonstrates that even after denaturation, some of the duplex remained annealed, reflecting the very high affinity of duplexes comprised to 2'-methoxy nucleosides. Lanes 6-9 show that both the nuclear and cytosolic ribonucleases cleaved the triplex substrate at several sites with the oligoribonucleotide gap and that the sites of degradation were different from those of RNase V1. The position of the degradates in lanes 6-9 is consistent with them being the 2' methoxy phosphorothioate flanking regions (wings).</p><heading>EXAMPLE 29</heading><p>RNA affinity columns and methods of purifying ribonucleases</p><p>Techniques for preparing nucleic acid affinity columns are known in the art (see, e.g., Kadonaga, Methods in Enzymology, 1991, 208, 10). Such affinity columns comprise a matrix comprising a nucleic acid substrate for a desired compound that binds the substrate either nonspecifically or in a sequence-specific manner. Initially utilized in the purification of DNA-binding proteins, RNA affinity columns have also been employed to purify RNA-binding proteins and ribonucleases (see, e.g., Prokipcak et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269, 9261; Dake et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1988, 263, 7691). A matrix comprising one or more dsRNase substrates of the invention has the advantage of providing a dsRNA substrate that is resistant to the action of single-stranded ribonuclease which are prevalent in many tissues and cells.
