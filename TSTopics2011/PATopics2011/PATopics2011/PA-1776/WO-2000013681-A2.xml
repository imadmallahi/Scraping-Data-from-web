In particular, the present invention relates to the treatment of disorders in which the reduction of purinergic neurotransmission could be beneficial. The invention relates in particular to adenosine receptors and particularly adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors, and to the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease.</p><p num="p0004">Movement disorders constitute a serious health problem, especially amongst the elderly sector of the population. These movement disorders are often the result of brain lesions. Disorders involving the basal ganglia which result in movement disorders include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea and Wilson's disease. Furthermore, dyskinesias often arise as sequelae of cerebral ischaemia and other neurological disorders.</p><p num="p0005">There are four classic symptoms of Parkinson's disease: tremor, rigidity, akinesia and postural changes. The disease is also commonly associated with depression, dementia and overall cognitive decline. Parkinson's disease has a prevalence of 1 per 1,000 of the total population. The incidence increases to 1 per 100 for those aged over 60 years. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra and the subsequent reductions in interstitial concentrations of dopamine in the striatum are critical to the development of Parkinson's disease. Some 80% of cells from the substantia nigra need to be destroyed before the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease are manifested.</p><p num="p0006">Current strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease are based on transmitter replacement therapy (L-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (L-DOPA)), inhibition of monoamine oxidase (e.g. Deprenyl<sup>®</sup>), dopamine receptor agonists (e.g. bromocriptine and apomorphine) and anticholinergics (e.g. benztrophine, orphenadrine). Transmitter replacement therapy in particular does not provide consistent clinical benefit, especially after prolonged treatment when "on-off symptoms develop, and this treatment has also been associated with involuntary movements of athetosis and chorea, nausea and vomiting.

disorder resulting in a continuing cognitive decline in patients. Despite new drug approvals, there is still a medical need in terms of improved therapies for movement disorders, especially Parkinson's disease. In particular, effective treatments requiring less frequent dosing, effective treatments which are associated with less severe side- effects, and effective treatments which control or reverse the underlying neurodegenerative disorder, are required.</p><p num="p0007">Blockade of A adenosine receptors has recently been implicated in the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (Richardson, P.J. et al., Trends Pharmacol.

The potential utility of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonists in the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's Disease has recently been reviewed (Mally, J. and Stone, T.W., CNS Drugs, 1998, 10, 311-320).</p><p num="p0008">Adenosine is a naturally occurring purine nucleoside which has a wide variety of well- documented regulatory functions and physiological effects. The central nervous system (CNS) effects of this endogenous nucleoside have attracted particular attention in drug discovery, owing to the therapeutic potential of purinergic agents in CNS disorders (Jacobson, K.A. et al, J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 407-422). This therapeutic potential has resulted in considerable recent research endeavour within the field of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists (Bhagwhat, S.S.; Williams, M. Exp. Opin. Ther.

One potential underlying mechanism in the aforementioned treatment of movement disorders by the blockade of A<sub>2</sub> adenosine receptors is the evidence of a functional link between adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors to dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the CNS. Some of the early studies (e.g. Ferre, S. et al, Stimulation of high-affinity adenosine A<sub>2</sub> receptors decreases the affinity of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in rat striatal membranes.

KF 17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol and reserpine. Moreover, KF 17837 potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L-DOPA plus benserazide, suggesting that KF 17837 is a centrally active adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonists (Kanda, T. et al, Eur.

Ewr. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 328, 135 - 141). This approach is also considered a valid method for screening drugs with potential antiparkinsonian effects. Thus, the ability of novel adenosine antagonists to block haloperidol-induced deficits in locomotor activity in mice can be used to assess both in vivo and potential antiparkinsonian efficacy.

Test substances are typically administered 5-60 minutes prior to testing. The animals are then placed individually into clean, clear polycarbonate cages [20 (width) x 40 (length) x 20 (height) cm , with a flat perforated, Perspex lid]. Horizontal locomotor activity is determined by placing the cages within a frame contaimng a 3 x 6 anay of photocells linked to a computer, which tabulates beam breaks. Mice are left undisturbed to explore for 1 hour, and the number of beams breaks made during this period serves as a record of locomotor activity which is compared with data for control animals for statistically significant differences. In this model, Example 86, administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/kg, significantly reversed haloperidol-induced hypolocomotion.</p><p num="p0385">6-OHDA Model Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by symptoms of muscle rigidity, tremor, paucity of movement (hypokinesia), and postural instability. It has been established for some time that the primary deficit in PD is a loss of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra which project to the striatum, and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="65"/>-->
indeed a substantial proportion of striatal dopamine is lost (ca 80-85%) before symptoms are observed. The loss of striatal dopamine results in abnormal activity of the basal ganglia, a series of nuclei which regulate smooth and well co-ordinated movement (Blandini F. et al, Glutamate and Parkinson's Disease. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996, 12, 73 - 94). The neurochemical deficits seen in Parkinson's disease can be reproduced by local injection of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine into brain regions containing either the cell bodies or axonal fibres of the nigrostriatal neurones.</p><p num="p0386">By unilaterally lesioning the nigrostriatal pathway on only one-side of the brain, a behavioural asymmetry in movement inhibition is observed. Although unilaterally- lesioned animals are still mobile and capable of self maintenance, the remaining dopamine-sensitive neurones on the lesioned side become supersenstive to stimulation. This is demonstrated by the observation that following systemic administration of dopamine agonists, such as apomorphine, animals show a pronounced rotation in a direction contralateral to the side of lesioning. The ability of compounds to induce contralateral rotations in 6-OHDA lesioned rats has proven to be a sensitive model to predict drug efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease.</p><p num="p0387">Animals</p><p num="p0388">Male Sprague-Dawley rats, obtained from Charles River, were used for all experiments.

Surgery</p><p num="p0391">15 minutes prior to surgery, animals were given an intraperitoneal injection of the noradrenergic uptake inhibitor desipramine (25 mg/kg) to prevent damage to non- dopamine neurones. Animals were then placed in an anaesthetic chamber and anaesthetised using a mixture of oxygen and isoflurane. Once unconscious, the animals were transfened to a stereotaxic frame, where anaesthesia was maintained through a mask. The top of the animal's head was shaved and sterilised using an iodine solution. Once dry, a 2 cm long incision was made along the midline of the scalp and the skin retracted and clipped back to expose the skull. A small hole was then drilled through the skill above the injection site. In order to lesion the nigrostriatal pathway, the injection cannula was slowly lowered to position above the right medial forebrain bundle at -3.2 mm anterior posterior, -1.5 mm medial lateral from bregma, and to a depth of 7.2 mm below the duramater. 2 minutes after lowing the cannula, 2 μL of 6- OHDA was infused at a rate of 0.5 μL/min over 4 minutes, yeilding a final dose of 8 μg. The cannula was then left in place for a further 5 minutes to facilitate diffusion before being slowly withdrawn. The skin was then sutured shut using Ethicon W501 Mersilk, and the animal removed from the strereotaxic frame and returned to its homecage. The rats were allowed 2 weeks to recover from surgery before behavioural testing.</p><p num="p0392">Apparatus</p><p num="p0393">Rotational behaviour was measured using an eight station rotameter system provided by Med Associates, San Diego, USA. Each station was comprised of a stainless steel bowl (45 cm diameter x 15 cm high) enclosed in a transparent Plexiglas cover running around the edge of the bowl, and extending to a height of 29 cm. To assess rotation, rats were placed in cloth jacket attached to a spring tether connected to optical rotameter positioned above the bowl, which assessed movement to the left or right either as partial (45°) or full (360°) rotations. All eight stations were interfaced to a computer that tabulated data.

Procedure</p><p num="p0394">To reduce stress during drug testing, rats were initially habituated to the apparatus for 15 minutes on four consecutive days. On the test day, rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of test compound 30 minutes prior to testing. Immediately prior to testing, animals were given a subcutaneous injection of a subthreshold dose of apomorphine, then placed in the harness and the number of rotations recorded for one hour. The total number of full contralatral rotations during the hour test period served as an index of antiparkinsonian drug efficacy.
