composition, preferably a dishwashing composition. Said first and second pouch or composition comprised therein providing a different visual effect or comprising at least one different ingredient.</p><heading>BACKGROUND</heading><p num="p0002">Water-soluble or water-dispersible pouches are known in the prior art. Such pouches have been described as a method of packaging laundry detergent since the 1980s. Such pouches are generally understood to provide a convenient method of allowing the user to handle the detergent product without having to directly handle chemicals, especially hazardous or irritable chemicals.</p><p num="p0003"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="EP879874A" status="new"><text>EP 879 874</text></patcit> describes pouches comprising hard surface cleaning compositions, including hand dishwashing compositions. Such pouches are described to provide the similar benefits as pouches provided to the laundry detergent industry, namely convenience and ease of handling.</p><p num="p0004">The Applicants have however found that whilst consumers welcome pouches for the above reasons of convenience, given the choice they would prefer to be able to vary the product used depending on the nature or severity of the job, the character or mood of the user. The present invention thus provides a kit of water-soluble or water-dispersible pouches, comprising at least 2 pouches, each pouch providing a different visual effect or comprising a different composition. Said composition may differ in the perfume, dye or active ingredients as described in detail below.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p num="p0005">It is further envisaged that the kit of the present invention may equally be applied to other hard surface cleaning or laundry applications.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="p0006">According to the present invention there is provided kit comprising at least a first and a second water-soluble or water-dispersible pouch containing at least a first and a second composition, each composition comprised therein providing a different visual effect, said first and second compositions comprising a colourant, said colourants being different from one another and producing different colour effects.</p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="p0007">The kit of the present invention comprises at least two pouches, said pouches comprising compositions. The kit comprises at least a first type of pouch comprising a first type of composition and a second type of pouch comprising a second type of composition. In a preferred embodiment the kit comprises a first and second type of pouch and composition and a third, optionally fourth and optionally further types of pouch and composition. Each pouch or composition contained therein providing a different visual effect or comprising at least one different ingredient. By the term 'visual effect' it is meant the visual appearance of the pouch or composition noticeable by the human eye. By 'pouch or compositions comprising at least one different ingredient' it is meant herein that the pouch composition contained within the pouch may be substantially identical but differ by the presence of at least one ingredient in the first pouch or composition that is not present in the second pouch or composition or vice versa. In a preferred aspect of the present invention the first and second and optionally third, fourth and further pouches or compositions each comprise at least one ingredient that is not present in each of the other pouches or compositions. More preferably the pouches are all identical and the compositions provide the different visual effect or chemically different composition.</p><p num="p0008">The difference in visual effect may be achieved by varying for example the shape, size, texture of the pouch. Alternatively the difference in visual effect may be achieved by varying the colour, transparency, form of the compositions. The composition may be dyed to any preferred colour depending on the presence of colourant in the composition. The composition may be more or less<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> transparent depending on the formulation, for example the composition may be opaque or transparent or any degree of transparency in between. The composition may be in solid, liquid, gel, paste form or mixtures thereof. For example the compositions may be liquid and one may comprise suspended solid particles. Said suspended solid particles may be any size, shape or colour as is required. In one embodiment the compositions all comprise suspended solids in a liquid matrix and the compositions differ in the colour or size of the suspended solids. Alternatively one composition may be in the form of a homogeneous substantially transparent liquid, whilst the other is in the form of a substantially opaque emulsion.</p><p num="p0009">The kit preferably comprises sufficient pouches of the first type and second type to provide a months supply of detergent product. More preferably the kit comprises at least 7 to 15 pouches, more preferably a mixture of at least the first pouches, comprising the first composition and the second pouches comprising the second composition. More preferably the kit comprises first, second, third and fourth pouches and compositions.</p><heading><u style="single">Pouch</u></heading><p num="p0010">The pouch of the invention, herein referred to as "pouch", is typically a closed structure, made of a water-soluble or water-dispersible film described herein, enclosing a volume space which comprises a composition. Said composition is described in more detail herein. The pouch can be of any form, shape and material which is suitable to hold the composition, e.g. without allowing the release of the composition from the pouch prior to contact of the pouch with water. The exact execution will depend on for example, the type and amount of the composition in the pouch, the number of compartments in the pouch, the characteristics required from the pouch to hold, protect and deliver or release the composition.</p><p num="p0011">The pouch may be of such a size that it conveniently contains either a unit dose amount of the composition herein, suitable for the required operation, for example one wash, or only a partial dose, to allow the consumer greater flexibility to vary the amount used, for example depending on the size and/or degree of soiling of the washing load.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p num="p0012">It may be preferred that the water-soluble or water-dispersible film and preferably the pouch as a whole is stretched during formation and/or closing of the pouch, such that the resulting pouch is at least partially stretched. This is to reduce the amount of film required to enclose the volume space of the pouch. When the film is stretched the film thickness decreases. The degree of stretching indicates the amount of stretching of the film by the reduction in the thickness of the film. For example, if by stretching the film, the thickness of the film is exactly halved then the stretch degree of the stretched film is 100%. Also, if the film is stretched so that the film thickness of the stretched film is exactly a quarter of the thickness of the unstretched film then the stretch degree is exactly 200%. Typically and preferably, the thickness and hence the degree of stretching is non-uniform over the pouch, due to the formation and closing process. For example, when a water-soluble or water-dispersible film is positioned in a mould and an open compartment is formed by vacuum forming (and then filled with the components of a composition and then closed), the part of the film in the bottom of the mould, furthest removed from the points of closing will be stretched more than in the top part. Preferably, the film which is furthest away from the opening, e.g. the film in the bottom of the mould, will be stretched more and be thinner than the film closest by the opening, e.g. at the top part of the mould.</p><p num="p0013">Another advantage of stretching the pouch, is that the stretching action, when forming the shape of the pouch and/or when closing the pouch, stretches the pouch non-uniformly, which results in a pouch which has a non-uniform thickness. This allows control of the dissolution of water-soluble pouches herein, and for example sequential release of the components of the detergent composition enclosed by the pouch to the water.</p><p num="p0014">Preferably, the pouch is stretched such that the thickness variation in the pouch formed of the stretched film is from 10 to 1000%, preferably 20% to 600%, or even 40% to 500% or even 60% to 400%. This can be measured by any method, for example by use of an appropriate micrometer. Preferably the pouch is made from a water-soluble film that is stretched, said film has a stretch degree of from 40% to 500%, preferably from 40% to 200%.</p><p num="p0015">The pouch is made from a water-soluble or water-dispersible film. It is preferred that the pouch as a whole comprises material which is water-dispersible or more preferably water-soluble.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p num="p0016">Preferred water-soluble films are polymeric materials, preferably polymers which are formed into a film or sheet. The material in the form of a film can for example be obtained by casting, blow-moulding, extrusion or blow extrusion of the polymer material, as known in the art.</p><p num="p0017">Preferred water-dispersible material herein has a dispersability of at least 50%, preferably at least 75% or even at least 95%, as measured by the method set out hereinafter using a glass-filter with a maximum pore size of 50 microns.</p><p num="p0018">More preferably the material is water-soluble and has a solubility of at least 50%, preferably at least 75% or even at least 95%, as measured by the method set out hereinafter using a glass-filter with a maximum pore size of 50 microns, namely:</p><p num="p0019">Gravimetric method for determining water-solubility or water-dispersability of the material of the compartment and/or pouch:</p><p num="p0020">50 grams ¬± 0.1 gram of material is added in a 400 ml beaker, the weight of which has been determined, and 245ml ¬± 1ml of distilled water is added. This is stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer set at 600 rpm, for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture is filtered through a folded qualitative sintered-glass filter with pore size as defined above (max. 50 micron). The water is dried off from the collected filtrate by any conventional method, and the weight of the remaining polymer is determined (which is the dissolved or dispersed fraction). Then, the % solubility or dispersability can be calculated.</p><p num="p0021">Preferred polymers, copolymers or derivatives thereof are selected from polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides, acrylamide, acrylic acid, cellulose, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, cellulose amides, polyvinyl acetates, polycarboxylic acids and salts, polyaminoacids or peptides, polyamides, polyacrylamide, copolymers of maleic/acrylic acids, polysaccharides including starch and gelatine, natural gums such as xanthum and carragum. More preferably the polymer is selected from polyacrylates and water-soluble acrylate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, dextrin, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, most<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> preferably polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Preferably, the level of a type polymer (e.g., commercial mixture) in the film material, for example PVA polymer, is at least 60% by weight of the film.</p><p num="p0022">The polymer can have any weight average molecular weight, preferably from about 1000 to 1,000,000, or even from 10,000 to 300,000 or even from 15,000 to 200,000 or even from 20,000 to 150,000.</p><p num="p0023">Mixtures of polymers can also be used. This may in particular be beneficial to control the mechanical and/or dissolution properties of the compartment or pouch, depending on the application thereof and the required needs. For example, it may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is present in the material of the compartment, whereby one polymer material has a higher water-solubility than another polymer material, and/or one polymer material has a higher mechanical strength than another polymer material. It may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is used, having different weight average molecular weights, for example a mixture of PVA or a copolymer thereof of a weight average molecular weight of 10,000- 40,000, preferably around 20,000, and of PVA or copolymer thereof, with a weight average molecular weight of about 100,000 to 300,000, preferably around 150,000.</p><p num="p0024">Also useful are polymer blend compositions, for example comprising a hydrolytically degradable and water-soluble polymer blend such as polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, achieved by the mixing of polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, typically comprising 1-35% by weight polylactide and approximately from 65% to 99% by weight polyvinyl alcohol, if the material is to be water-dispersible, or water-soluble.</p><p num="p0025">It may be preferred that the polymer present in the film is from 60-98% hydrolysed, preferably 80% to 90%, to improve the dissolution of the material.</p><p num="p0026">Most preferred are films which are water-soluble and stretchable films, as described above. Highly preferred water-soluble films are films which comprise PVA polymers and that have<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> similar properties to the film known under the trade reference M8630, as sold by Chris-Craft Industrial Products of Gary, Indiana, US.</p><p num="p0027">The water-soluble film herein may comprise other additive ingredients than the polymer or polymer material. For example, it may be beneficial to add plasticisers, for example glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethyleneglycol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and mixtures thereof, additional water, disintegrating aids. It may be useful that the pouch or water-soluble film itself comprises a detergent additive to be delivered to the wash water.</p><p num="p0028">The pouch is made by a process comprising the steps of contacting a composition herein to a water-soluble film in such a way as to partially enclose said composition to obtain a partially formed pouch, optionally contacting said partially formed pouch with a second water-soluble film, and then sealing said partially formed pouch to obtain a pouch.</p><p num="p0029">Preferably, the pouch is made using a mould, preferably the mould has rounded inner side walls and rounded inner bottom wall. A water-soluble film may be vacuum pulled into the mould so that said film is flush with the inner walls of the mould. A composition herein may then be poured into the mould, a second water-soluble film may be placed over the mould with the composition and the pouch may then be sealed, preferably the partially formed pouch is heat sealed. The film is preferably stretched during the formation of the pouch.</p><p num="p0030">The pouches of the present invention comprises from 1 to 50 mL, more preferably from 1 to 30 mL ,more preferably from 1 to 20 mL and most preferably from 2 to 10 mL of composition.</p><heading><u style="single">Composition</u></heading><p num="p0031">The compositions of the present invention may comprise ingredients selected from the group consisting of hydrotrope, viscosity modifier, diamine, surfactants, polymeric suds stabiliser, enzymes, builder, oxygen bleach, bleach activator, bleach catalyst, perfume, solvent, colourants, chelating agent, soil release polymers, polymeric dispersants, polysaccharides, abrasives, bactericides and other antimicrobials, tarnish inhibitors, , buffers, antifungal or mildew control agents, insect repellents, processing aids, suds boosters, brighteners, anti-corrosive aids,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> stabilizers, antioxidants and mixtures thereof More preferably the composition comprise ingredients selected from the group consisting of perfume, dye and mixtures thereof</p><p num="p0032">All parts, percentages and ratios used herein are expressed as percent weight unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="p0033">The compositions may be aqueous or non-aqueous. Where the compositions are aqueous they preferably comprise less than 15 % water, more preferably less than 12% water, more preferably less than 8% water and most preferably less than 6 % water.</p><p num="p0034">The composition may be prepared for specific dishwashing tasks. For example a tough food cleaning unit dose detergent may preferably comprise ingredients selected from solvents, builders, chelants, abrasives, enzymes, anionic surfactants and mixtures thereof. Compositions for glass cleaning preferably comprise ingredients selected from builders, chelants, solvents, sheeting nonionic surfactants and mixtures thereof. Compositions conferring a mildness benefit on the user may preferably comprise protease enzymes. Compositions for cleaning specific stains, especially highly coloured stains for example tea, coffee, wine, tomato-based stains, preferably comprise ingredients selected from stabilised oxygen bleach, bleach activator, catalysts and mixtures thereof.</p><heading><u style="single">Perfumes</u></heading><p num="p0035">In a preferred aspect of the present invention the compositions comprise a perfume. In a particularly preferred embodiment the compositions comprise different perfumes such that the user will gain a different olfactory experience with each different type of pouch.</p><p num="p0036">In a particularly preferred embodiment the compositions comprise a blooming perfume. A blooming perfume composition is one which comprises blooming perfume ingredients. A blooming perfume ingredient may be characterized by its boiling point (B.P.) and its octanol/water partition coefficient (P). B.P. according to the present invention is measured under normal standard pressure of 760 mmHg. The boiling points of many perfume ingredients,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> at standard 760 mm Hg are given in, e.g., "<nplcit id="ncit0001" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Perfume and Flavor Chemicals (Aroma Chemicals)," Steffen Arctander, published by the author, 1969</text></nplcit>, incorporated herein by reference.</p><p num="p0037">The octanol/water partition coefficient of a perfume ingredient is the ratio between its equilibrium concentrations in octanol and in water. The partition coefficients of the preferred perfume ingredients of the present invention may be more conveniently given in the form of their logarithm to the base 10, logP. The logP values of many perfume ingredients have been reported; for example, the Pomona92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, California, contains many, along with citations to the original literature. However, the logP values are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" program, also available from Daylight CIS. This program also lists experimental logP values when they are available in the Pomona92 database. The "calculated logP" (ClogP) is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo ( cf., <nplcit id="ncit0002" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>A. Leo, in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 4, C. Hansch, P. G. Sammens, J. B. Taylor and C. A. Ramsden, Eds., p. 295, Pergamon Press, 1990</text></nplcit>, incorporated herein by reference). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each perfume ingredient, and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity, and chemical bonding.

Non-limiting examples of these materials are ethyl alcohol, carbitol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate. These materials are used for, e.g., solubilizing or diluting some solid or viscous perfume ingredients to, e.g., improve handling and/or formulating. These materials are useful in the blooming perfume compositions, but are not counted in the calculation of the limits for the definition/formulation of the blooming perfume compositions of the present invention.</p><p num="p0043">It can be desirable to use blooming and delayed blooming perfume ingredients and even other ingredients, preferably in small amounts, in the blooming perfume compositions of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> invention, that have low odor detection threshold values. The odor detection threshold of an odorous material is the lowest vapor concentration of that material which can be detected. The odor detection threshold and some odor detection threshold values are discussed in, e.g., "<nplcit id="ncit0003" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Standardized Human Olfactory Thresholds", M. Devos et al, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, 1990</text></nplcit>, and "<nplcit id="ncit0004" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Compilation of Odor and Taste Threshold Values Data", F. A.

The use of small amounts of non-blooming perfume ingredients that have low odor detection threshold values can improve perfume odor character, without the potential negatives normally associated with such ingredients, e.g., spotting and/or filming on, e.g., dish surfaces. Non-limiting examples of perfume ingredients that have low odor detection threshold values useful in the present invention include coumarin, vanillin, ethyl vanillin, methyl dihydro isojasmonate, 3-hexenyl salicylate, isoeugenol, lyral, gamma-undecalactone, gamma-dodecalactone, methyl beta naphthyl ketone, and mixtures thereof These materials are preferably present at low levels in addition to the blooming and optionally delayed blooming ingredients, typically less than 5%, preferably less than 3%, more preferably less than 2%, by weight of the blooming perfume compositions of the present invention.</p><p num="p0044">The perfumes suitable for use in the cleaning compositions herein can be formulated from known fragrance ingredients and for purposes of enhancing environmental compatibility, the perfume compositions used herein are preferably substantially free of halogenated fragrance materials and nitromusks.</p><p num="p0045">Alternatively the perfume ingredients of the present invention or a portion thereof may be complexed with a complexing agent. Complexing agents may include any compound which encapsulate or bind perfume raw materials in aqueous solution. Binding can result from one or more of strong reversible chemical bonding, reversible weak chemical bonding, weak or strong physical absorption or adsorption and, for example, may take the form of encapsulation, partial encapsulation, or binding. Complexes formed can be 1:1, 1:2, 2:1 complexant:perfume ratios, or can be more complex combinations. It is also possible to bind perfumes via physical encapsulation via coating (e.g. starch coating), or coacervation. Key to effective complexation for controlled<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> perfume release is an effective de-complexation mechanism, driven by use of the product for washing dishes or hard surfaces. Suitable de-complexation mechanisms can include dilution in water, increased or decreased temperature, increased or decreased ionic strength. It is also possible to chemically or physically decompose a coated perfume, eg via reaction with enzyme, bleach or alkalinity, or via solubilization by surfactants or solvents. Preferred complexing agents include cyclodextrin, zeolites, coacervates starch coatings, and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="p0046">Cyclodextrin molecules are known for their ability to form complexes with perfume ingredients and have typically been taught as a perfume carrier. In addition, cyclodextrin molecules also appear to be surprisingly effective at reducing malodors generated by nitrogenous compounds, such as amines.

The prior art teaches the use of drier-added fabric softener sheets containing high levels of cyclodextrin/perfume complexes wherein the fabrics treated with this solid cyclodextrin complex release perfume when the fabrics are rewetted and that these cyclodextrin/perfume complexes can be used in aqueous rinse-added fabric softener compositions without being protected. By "protected" it is meant that the cyclodextrin is encapsulated in a hydrophobic wax coating so the cyclodextrin/perfume complexes will not decompose due to the presence of water. See e.g. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US5578563A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,563, issued Nov. 26, 1996, to Trinh et al.</text></patcit>, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Thus the cyclodextrin used in the present invention may either be "unprotected", as discussed above, or "protected" by the hydrophobic-coating protection techniques discussed in the prior art; see e.g. <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US5102564A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat.No. 5,102,564 to Gardlik et al., issued Apr. 7, 1992</text></patcit>; <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="US5234610A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat.

It is preferable in the present invention that the cone-shaped cavity of the cyclodextrins have a length (altitude) of 8 √Ö and a base size of from 5 √Ö to 8.5 √Ö. Thus the preferred cavity volume for cyclodextrins of the present invention is from 65 √Ö<sup>3</sup> to 210 √Ö<sup>3</sup>.</p><p num="p0048">Suitable cyclodextrin species include any of the known cyclodextrins such as unsubstituted cyclodextrins containing from six to twelve glucose units, especially, alpha-cyclodextrin, beta-cyclodextrin, gamma-cyclodextrin and/or their derivatives and/or mixtures thereof. The alpha-cyclodextrin<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> consists of six glucose units, the beta-cyclodextrin consists of seven glucose units, and the gamma-cyclodextrin consists of eight glucose units arranged in a donut-shaped ring. The specific coupling and conformation of the glucose units give the cyclodextrins a rigid, conical molecular structure with a hollow interior of a specific volume. The "lining" of the internal cavity is formed by hydrogen atoms and glycosidic bridging oxygen atoms, therefore this surface is fairly hydrophobic. The unique shape and physical-chemical property of the cavity enable the cyclodextrin molecules to absorb (form inclusion complexes with) organic molecules or parts of organic molecules which can fit into the cavity. Many perfume molecules can fit into the cavity.</p><p num="p0049">The cyclodextrin molecules are preferably water-soluble. The water-soluble cyclodextrins used herein preferably have a water solubility of at least 10 g in 100 ml water, more preferably at least 25 g in 100 ml of water at standard temperature and pressure. Examples of preferred water-soluble cyclodextrin derivative species suitable for use herein are hydroxypropyl alpha-cyclodextrin, methylareal alpha-cyclodextrin, methylated beta-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl beta-cyclodextrin, and hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin. Hydroxyalkyl cyclodextrin derivatives preferably have a degree of substitution of from 1 to 14, more preferably from 1.5 to 7, wherein the total number of OR groups per cyclodextrin is defined as the degree of substitution. Methylated cyclodextrin derivatives typically have a degree of substitution of from 1 to 18, preferably from 3 to 16. A known methylated beta-cyclodextrin is heptakis-2,6-di-O-methyl-.beta.-cyclodextrin, commonly known as DIMEB, in which each glucose unit has 2 methyl groups with a degree of substitution of 14. A preferred, more commercially available methylated beta-cyclodextrin is a randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin having a degree of substitution of 12.6. The preferred cyclodextrins are available, e.g., from American Maize-Products Company and Wacker Chemicals (USA), Inc.</p><p num="p0050">Further cyclodexrin species suitable for use in the present invention include alpha-cyclodextrin and derivatives thereof, gamma-cyclodextrin and derivatives thereof, derivatised beta-cyclodextrins, and/or mixtures thereof Other derivatives of cyclodextrin which are suitable for use in the present invention are discussed in <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="US5578563A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,563</text></patcit>, incorporated above. It should be noted that two or more different species of cyclodextrin may be used in the same liquid detergent composition.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p num="p0051">The complexes may be formed in any of the ways known in the art. Typically, the complexes are formed either by bringing the fragrance materials and the cyclodextrin together in a suitable solvent e.g. water and ethanol mixtures, propylene glycol. Additional examples of suitable processes as well as further preferred processing parameters and conditions are disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="US5234610A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,610, to Gardlik et al., issued August 10, 1993</text></patcit>, which is hereby incorporated by reference. After the cyclodextrin and fragrance materials are mixed together, this mixture is added to the liquid detergent composition.</p><p num="p0052">Generally, only a portion (not all) of the fragrance materials mixed with the cyclodextrin will be encapsulated by the cyclodextrin and form part of the cyclodextrin/perfume complex; the remaining fragrance materials will be free of the cyclodextrin and when the cyclodextrin/perfume mixture is added to the detergent composition they will enter the detergent composition as free perfume molecules. A portion of free cyclodextrin molecules which are not complexed with the fragrance materials may also be present. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the fragrance materials and cyclodextrins are added uncomplexed and separately to the liquid detergent compositions. Consequently, the cyclodextirns and fragrance materials will come into the presence of each other in the composition, and a portion of each will combine to form the desired fragrance materials/cyclodextrin complex.

Suitable fragrance materials for use in the present invention are described in greater detail below. In general, perfume/cyclodextrin complexes have a molar ratio of perfume compound to cyclodextrin of 1:1. However, the molar ratio can be either higher or lower, depending on the size of the perfume compound and the identity of the cyclodextrin compound. In the present invention the molar ratio of fragrance materials to cyclodextrin is preferably from 4:1 to 1:4, more preferably from 1.5:1 to 1:2, most preferably from 1:1 to 1:1.5. The molar ratio can be determined easily by forming a saturated solution of the cyclodextrin and adding the perfume to form the complex. In general the complex will precipitate readily. If not, the complex can usually be precipitated by the addition of electrolyte, change of pH, cooling, etc. The complex can then be analyzed to determine the ratio of perfume to cyclodextrin.

The actual complexes are determined by the size of the cavity in the cyclodextrin and<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> the size of the perfume molecule. Although the normal complex is one molecule of perfume in one molecule of cyclodextrin, complexes can be formed between one molecule of perfume and two molecules of cyclodextrin when the perfume molecule is large and contains two portions that can fit in the cyclodextrin. Highly desirable complexes can be formed using mixtures of cyclodextrins since perfumes are normally mixtures of materials that vary widely in size. It is usually desirable that at least a majority of the material be beta- and/or gamma-cyclodextrin. It is highly desirable to use the reaction mixtures from the intermediate stages of the manufacture of the pure cyclodextrins as discussed hereinbefore.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Perfume Examples</u></b></heading><p num="p0053">The following examples numbered A to H, of the preferred perfume composition are in no way meant to be limiting.

A cylindrical magnetic stirrer (length 50mm, diameter 8mm) was added to the water and set to rotate at 200 rpm. The time is measured between placing the pouch into the water and the first moment of release of dishwashing composition. The above experiment is repeated 4 times. The pouch of the present invention should preferably at least partially dissolve in water, according to the above test method, in less than 60 seconds, more preferably less than 30 seconds, more preferably less than 20 seconds. In a preferred embodiment the pouch is used in combination with an applicator. The applicator may be squeezed at least once before contacting the dishware with the applicator. Squeezing the applicator comprising the unit dose detergent, more preferably the pouch, breaks or bursts the unit dose and improves the rate of release of the detergent into the applicator.</p><p num="p0135">The applicator may be any suitable implement for applying detergent to a surface and washing dishware, as long as it comprises a cavity suitable for receiving the pouch. The applicator may be any such suitable applicator currently available on the market that has been adapted to comprise a cavity. Suitable applicators include a cloth, wipe, sheet, sponge, brush or mixtures thereof More preferably the applicator is a sponge. By the term 'cavity' it is meant a hole, indent or generally carved-out space which provides an area suitable in size to hold the pouch. For example the cavity may be found on one exterior surface of the applicator. The cavity may be partially or completely covered by a cap arrangement to protect the pouch and keep it within the applicator. Alternatively the cavity may be found inside the applicator. In this latter embodiment<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> the cavity may be accessed by a tube extending from an exterior surface into the interior cavity of the applicator. In this case, the exterior end of the tube may be partially or completely covered or closed. The exterior surface of the tube may be covered with a cap arrangement. Alternatively opposing sides of the tube may be brought together and secured, effectively closing the tube using any suitable material, for example Velcro (tradename). Closing or covering the exterior surface of the cavity of tube in this way protects the composition and keeps it within the applicator. The tube may be provided either may cutting away part of the applicator itself to make a tube or a separate tube in suitable material e.g. plastic, may be added to the applicator. Alternatively the applicator may consist of at least two sections which are at least partially separable from one another. The first section comprises the cavity and the second complimentary section may then be secured to the first section. The cavity may then be accessed by separating the at least two sections of the applicator to reveal the cavity. The sections may be partially separable, for example hinged or totally separable. Once the pouch has been placed in the cavity, the sections of the applicator can then be replaced and secured together. The sections can be secured by any suitable method known in the art, for example by a lock, interlocking or Velcro (tradename)-type system.</p><heading><u style="single">Examples</u></heading><p num="p0136">The examples provided below are in no way meant to be limiting. The pouches are made by placing one layer of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film, Monosol M8630 film of 76 micron, into a mould with preferably rounded corners (24mm x 24mm). A vacuum is applied to deform the PVA film so that it takes the shape of the cavities. Heat is applied to the film to facilitate the deformation of the film. Whilst the vacuum is maintained, each cavity is filled with 5 ml of composition A-D listed below. A second layer of PVA film is then put on the mould and both PVA films are sealed onto each other to form the pouches. The average sealing conditions are 150¬∞C for 2 seconds. Finally, after releasing the vacuum, each pouch is individually cut by hand out of the net of 90 pouches. The perfumes listed below are selected form the perfume examples described earlier.
