Particular utility is found in the dental and medical arts where such compositions are suitable for the formation and construction of dental prosthesis such as artificial teeth, inlays, onlays, and facings, crowns and bridges and artificial bone parts and medical prosthetic body pars, such as knee joints and/or other bone engaged surfaces and the like where abrasion resistance, polishability and aesthetics are important.</p><p>Artificial teeth should exhibit certain physical and physiochemical characteristics to be suitable for use. They should be hard and resistant to chipping, durable, and stable to solvents, water, and heat. In addition, they should be of an aesthetically acceptable color, i.e., close to that of natural teeth, or be amenable to arti- ficial coloration. The teeth should not cause excessive wear to opposing natural or artificial teeth, should not wear out of conclusion, and should be capable of being bonded firmly to supportive structures. They should also be amenable to ordinary means of physical shaping, grinding, and polishing, so as to minimize production cost.</p><p>Various metals and ceramics as used in the formation of prior art artificial teeth and other dental appliances possess certain inherent deficiencies which lessen their desirability in dental applications. Thus, the metallic color of gold, amalgam, and other metallic species sees as an aesthetic detraction to the wearer of appliances made therefrom. In addition, the high cost most noble metals from which many such appliances are commonly made leads to a cost consideration whenever their use is con- templated. Ceramic materials, another common alternative, are often difficult to form into acceptable shapes, and may tend to be abrasive and aesthetically unpleasant surfaces upon the physical wearing of surface layers. Such materials are also difficult to polish satisfactorily. These reasons together with factors related to cost, to consumer preference, to the technical skills of dental practitioners, and to convenience have motivated a search for alternative positions suitable for the construction of dental appliances, inlays, onlays, crown and bridge material, artificial teeth and the like.</p><p>Of the presently available organic compositions used for the construction of artificial teeth, most are com- posed of acrylics, often crosslinked by polyfunctional moieties.</p><p>As used herein "self-lubricating material" means a material which is adapted to increase the lubricity of a product surface Preferably self-lubricating material for use as particles in prostheses in accordance with the invention has a kinetic coefficient of friction less than 0. 25 when measured using ASTM D 1894-78 with a load of 5 psi.</p><p>As used herein ASTM D 1894-78 is carried out using water and the same materials.</p><p>As used herein "water insensitive" means that water does not have a material effect upon the material so characterized.</p><p>It is to be understood that the term "bisphenol-Al" is commonly utilized in the art to indicate the chemical compound 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane. It is also to be understood that the term "bis-GMA" is commonly used to indicate the chemical compound 2,2-bis(4-(2-hydroxy-3- methacryloxypropoxy) phenyl) propane, otherwise referred to as "digycidyl methacrylate ester of bisphenol-A."</p><p>Dentsply U.S. Pat.

The dental composition is used to form dental products having reduced wear. The dental products formed are abrasion resistant and self-lubri- cating across their entire cross sections. In a preferred embodiment the self-lubricating material is selected from among those having coefficients of friction one-half or less of that for polymethyl methacrylate. The particles are reacted so they may be chemically bonded to the polymer matrix within which they are dispersed. In a preferred embodiment polyethylene particles having a molecular weight of at least 1,000,000, and a particle size less than 80 microns are dispersed within an acrylate or methacrylate polymer matrix. The composition is formed into a dental prosthesis, such as an artificial tooth, inlay, onlay, facing, crown or bridge.</p><?description-type Drawing Description?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p>FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional side view of an posterior tooth in accordance, with the invention.</p><p>FIG. 2 is a front view of an posterior tooth in accordance with the invention.</p><?description-type Detailed Description?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading><p>Dental compositions of matter are described which include self-lubricating polymeric material. The dental compositions are molded to form dental prosthesis having reduced abrasive wear. While not wishing to be held to any theory describing the mechanism operative by which additions of self-lubricating, polymer improves abrasion resistance, it is hypothesized that as the matrix polymer is worn away new particles of the self-lubricating abrasion resistant polymer bonded to the matrix are exposed which smear over the surface of the molded article to provide a modified surface with lower coefficient of friction and consequent improved abrasive wear resistance. Self-lubricating particles are bonded to the matrix material to avoid being torn or otherwise removed in-toto from the matrix during conditions of abrasive wear. The dental products formed show improved abrasion resistant and preferably are self-lubricating across their entire cross sections. In a preferred embodiment the self- lubricating material preferably includes polyethylene particles having a molecular weight of at least 1,000,000, and a particle size less than 80 microns. The composition is formed into a dental prosthesis, artificial tooth, inlay, onlay, facing, crown or bridge.</p><p>Preferably an artificial posterior tooth has a tooth body, an enamel coating, a ridge lap, buckle face, occlusal face, and lingual face. In a preferred embodiment tooth body includes high molecular weight self-lubricating particles in an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) composition, and the enamel includes self-lubri- cating abrasion resistant particles in an interpenetrating network composition.</p><p>The self-lubricating material preferably is added in the form of particles and fibers. Most preferably, these self-lubricating particles are micron-sized particles of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene that have been functionalized by oxidation by gas plasma treatment preferably in the presence of a fluorine containing gas. Preferably particles of high molecular weight polyethy- lene, included as self-lubricating material in dental prosthesis in accordance with the invention, have a particle size less than 80 microns.</p><p>Self Lubricating Materials</p><p>Preferably the self-lubricating abrasion resistant material includes a polymers and copolymers of the general formula (I): ##STR1## wherein n is an integer from 100 to 1,000,000 (- -) is a single or a double bond; when (- -) is a double bond R, R', and R.sub.3 independently are hydrogen, or a lower alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbons, and R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are not present; when (- -) is a single bond R, R', R.sub.1, and R.sub.2, and R.sub.3, independently are hydrogen, fluorine or a lower alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbons.</p><p>Such polymers have a coefficient of friction of less than about one-half that of polymethyl methacrylate, or about 0.25 or less when measured using ASTM D 1894-78 with a load approximating 5 psi. An essential characteristic of the polymers and copolymers chosen is that their surface is capable of being bonded to the chosen matrix. A preferred method of achieving this is to oxidize or otherwise functionalize the particle surface as, for example, through oxyfluorination at elevated temperatures or gas plasma treatment. This requires the abstraction of hydrogen from the polymer chain. Accordingly polytetra- fluoroethylene or polytetrachloroethylene are unsuitable for use according to this invention. In contradistinction polymers such as trifluoroethylene or difluoroethylene, monofluoroethylene or polyethylene or polyproppylene, for example, with molecular weights greater than 500,000 or preferably 1,000,000 or more which may be functionalized in this manner are among preferred self-lubricating materials.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene with dynamic coefficient of friction in water against steel of 0.05-0.10 was utilized as the self- lubricating material ("Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylenes" by H. L. Stein, Engineering Plastics, Vol.2, 1988, ASM, Materials Part, Ohio). In comparision, the static coefficient of friction of polymethylmethacrylate against steel (CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Engineering, 60th edition, 1980, pages F-21, F-23) is 0.4-0.5.</p><p>Preferably self-lubricating material within the scope of general formula (I) is in the form of particles which have been treated with a fluorine containing gas as disclosed by Bauman et al in U.S. Pat. 4,771,110, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to generage functional reactive sites in the surface layer of the particles. For example, particles of UHMWPE having functional reactive sites in the surface layer are sold by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. under the trademark PRIMAX.</p><p>Dental Uses</p><p>Artificial teeth and other dental prostheses which are prepared from hardenable dental compositions in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention have outer face(s) which include polymeric self-lubricat- ing material. For example, occlusal portions, i.e. "enamel", of artificial teeth are molded from compositions of the invention and are laminated over the tooth body (32 of FIG. 1) which may be made from less abrasion resist- ant prior art materials. Alternatively, enamel and body portion may be molded from the material of the invention.</p><p>In general, the novel compositions of this invention are useful for the formation, construction and repair of dental appliances, artificial teeth, oral prosthesis, and similar articles. In addition, compositions in accordance with the invention are utilized especially as inlay or onlays cemented into or onto teeth, and in the prepa- ration of dental crowns and bridges.</p><p>The hardenable dental molding compositions of a pre- ferred interpenetrating network embodiment of the inven- tion include blends of powder and livid components which are combined in certain proportions and permitted to age or mature to produce a precursor blend that is moldable into prosthetic teeth and other dental devices. The precursor blend is formed by combining polymer and monomer which is then polymerized.</p><p>The hardenable dental molding compositions of the invention comprise a blend of powder and liquid components which are combined in certain proportions and are permitted to reach a moldable consistency and are then molded and polymerized by heat and light into a useful desired form. The resulting form may be the finished dental device or it may be machined or otherwise subse- quently post-formed to produce the desired shape, as for example a dental inlay formed from a computer assisted design and machining device. The powder may, for example, be comprised of a self-lubricating material, an acrylate or methacrylate polymer or copolymer, a monomer, a cross- linking monomer and/or oligomer, a polymerization cata- lyst, and optional inorganic filler such as silica, glass, or ceramic.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention product compositions include self-lubricating particles dispersed within an interpenetrating polymer network. Product compositions are formed from precursor blends. Precursor blends are formed by obtaining particulate self-lubricat- ing material, a crosslinked polymer, a monofunctional monomer and/or a crosslinkig monomer and/or oligomer. Optionally precursor blends include uncrosslinked polymer and a polymerization catalyst. Precursor blends are allowed to age or mature and then are molded and polymer- ized.</p><p>The crosslinked polymer is in the form of discrete particles having average diameters ranging form about 0.001 micron to about 500 microns. Preferably, at least 50 by weight of the particles have diameters less than about 150 microns, and more preferably, less than 100 microns. A mixture of two or more different crosslinked polymers may be used. A characteristic of the crosslinked polymer is that it will be insoluble in, but will be swollen by the liquid components used in the preparation of the precursor blend. Uncrosslinked polymer may be characterized as being capable of dissolving in or being dispersed by the liquid components of the blend. The liquid polymerizable monomer blend component of the compositions of the invention have the capacity to dissolve or disperse such uncrosslinked polymer, dissolve or become miscible with the crosslinking agent and swell the particles of crosslinked polymer. A mixture of two or more polymerizable mono and polyfunctional polymerizable monomers which dissolve or become miscible with the crosslinking agent and swell the particles of crosslinked polymer are used as the polymerizable monomer component of the composition of the invention.</p><p>Crosslinked powder used in a preferred embodiment of the invention is prepared from polyfunctional and/or monofunctional monomers which are polymerized, e.g. by bulk, solution, suspension or emulsion technics and comminuted to the preferred size ranges if necessary.</p><p>Monofunctional Monomers For Preparation Of Crosslinked Polymer Powder</p><p>Monomers useful in the production of the crosslinked polymers used in the practice of preferred embodiments of the invention include methyl-, ethyl-, isopropyl-, tert- butyloctyl-, dodecyl-, cyclohexyl-, chloromethyl-, tetra- chloroethyl-, perfluororooctyl-, hydroxyethyl-, hydroxy- propyl-, hydroxybutyl-, 3-hydroxy-phenyl-, 4-hydroxy- phenyl-, aminoethyl-, aminophenyl-, and thiophenyl-, acrylate, methacrylate, ethacrylate, propacrylate, butyl acrylate and chloromethacrylate, as well as the homologous mono-acrylic acid esters of bisphenol-A, dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, dihydroxydiphenyl ether, dihydroxybiphenyl, dihy- droxydiphenyl sulfoxide, and 2,2 bis(4-hydroxy-2,3,5,6- tetrafluorophenyl)propane, as examples only. Other suitable species will be apparent to those skilled in the art, some of which are later recited below.</p><p>Polyfunctional Monomers for Preparation of Crosslinked Polymer Powder</p><p>Crosslinking agents which are useful in the produc- tion of the crosslinked polymer component of a preferred embodiment of the invention include a wide variety of di- or polyfunctional moieties which are capable of crosslink- ing monomer species, for example, acrylic and lower alkyl acrylic acid diesters, acrylic and lower acrylic acid esters formed from alcohols having a second reactive function such as allyl methacrylate, urethane diacrylates and dimethacrylates, polyvinylic compounds, divinyl aromatic compounds, esters of di- or polyfunctional unsaturated acids, e.g., maleic, fumaric, citraconic, mesaconic, itaconic, malonic, or aconitic, etc., acids preferably reacted with either monohydric or poly- hydroxylic saturated and unsaturated alcohols to form esters which are effective polyfunctional crosslinking agents useful in the formulation of the crosslinked polymers of the invention. In general, these alcohols have one or more hydroxylic functionalities and have from 2 to about 30 carbon atoms. Thus, useful alcohols include allyl, methallyl, crotyl, vinyl, butenyl, isobutenyl and similar unsaturated alcohols as well as polyols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, diethylene glycol triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glyco, penta-ethylene glycol, glycol, glycerol, 1,3,3-tri- methylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dihydroxyphenol, and alkylidene bis-phenols such as bisphenol-A, 1,1-bis (4- hydroxy-phenyl) -methane, 4,4'dihydroxybiphenyl, 4,4'- dihydorxydiphenyl sulfoxide, dihydroxydiphenyl ether, dihydorxydiphenyl sulfoxide, resorcinol, hydroquinone, etc. and esters of a mono- or dibasic unsaturatad acid with an unsaturated monohydroxylic alcohol such as allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, vinyl acrylate (methacrylate and C.sub.1, to C.sub.2 homologs), dimethallyl fumarate, N-allyl acrylamide, crotyl acrylate, allyl crotonate, allyl cinnamate, diallyl maleate, etc. di-, tri-, and higher esters of polyhydroxylic alcohols such as ethylene "glycol" diacrylate (dimethacrylate and C.sub.2 -C.sub.40 homologs), trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, the diacrylate and dimethacrylate esters of bisphenol-A, as well as acrylate and alkyl acrylate esters which correspond to the general formula (II): ##STR2## where R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 may be the same or different and are hydrogen or alkyl groups containing from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms and n is a whole number from 1 to about 10. Alternatively, the crosslinking agent may conform to the formula (III) ##STR3## where R.sub.5 and R.sub.6 may be the same or different and are hydro- gen or alkyl groups containing from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms and A is an aromatic moiety selected from the group consisting of (a) biphenyl, diphenyl alkylidene having from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms in the alkylidene portion thereof, diphenyl sulfone, diphenyl sulfoxide, diphenyl ether, and diphenyl sulfide; (b) the diglycidyl deriva- tives of group (a); and (c) the diurethane derivatives of either group (a) or group (b). Additional examples include allyl acrylate, divinyl (trivinyl or higher homologs) benzene, substituted divinyl benzenes, and analogous compounds. Compounds such as bis and the Urethane diacrylate formed by reacting hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and their methacrylic homologs with 2,4,4-trimethylhexyl-1, 6-diisocyanate are especially useful, as are diallyl maleate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate and the dimethacrylate ester of bisphenol-A.</p><p>Furthermore, mixtures of two or more crosslinking agents are useful in the practice of the invention.</p><p>Preparation of Crosslinked Polymer Powder</p><p>Crosslinked polymer which may be prepared from the ingredients above or others which are useful in the practice of a preferred interpenetrating network embodi- ment of the invention are formed from monomers or blends of monomers together with crosslinking agents. The mono- mers suitable for use in the production of the cross- linked polymers include acrylic and lower alkyl acrylic acid esters, N-vinyl lactams, acrylamides, acrylonitriles, styrenes, alkenes, and urethanes. Preferred monofunc- tional monomeric species useful in the preparation of the composition of the invention include acrylic and lower alkyl acrylic acid esters which generally conform to the general formula (IV): ##STR4## Wherein R.sub.1 is hydrogen or an alkyl group including from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, and where R.sub.2 is either (a) an alkyl or cycloalkyl group including from 1 to about 20, and preferably from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms; (b) phenyl and (c) alkyl substituted phenyl in which the alkyl groups include form 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. Various substi- tuents may be present on either or both of the groups R.sub.1 and R.sub.2. Thus, hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, thiol and halogen (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, etc.) fuctionalities may be present, with the latter being preferred. Fluorine is an especially suitable and useful substituent.</p><p>The crosslinked polymer powders are produced by poly- merizing a mixture of the monomer or monomers and cross- linking agent or agents described above. The amount of crosslinking agent employed in the production of the crosslinked polymers used in the practice of the invention is a critical factor. It has been found that the capacity of particles of polymers so produced to swell with or to imbibe the liquid components forming the precursor blend of the invention, is directly related to the amount of crosslinking agent used in the production of such cross- linked polymers.</p><p>The physiochemical properties of the crosslinked polymer fillers useful in the preferred interpenetrating network embodiment of the invention determine the relative proportions of monomer and crosslinking agent used to formulate said suitable crosslinked polymers. Such cross- linked polymers must be sufficiently well crosslinked as to maintain substantially their structural identity when exposed to the liquid components of the precursor blend of the invention. At the same time, they must not be so thoroughly crosslinked as to be incapable of swelling with or imbibing such liquid components, Thus, it is con- venient to describe the proportion of crosslinking agent by what it does rather than by what it is. In view of the fact that the crosslinked polymers are utilized in finely particulate ford, as will be more fully explained, it is convenient to define the minimum amount of crosslinking agent used therein as being that amount which is suf- ficient to cause the particulate crosslinked polymer not to lose its particulate discreteness upon exposure to the liquid components of the invention. Similarly, the maximum amount of crosslinking agent used therein is that amount beyond which the resulting crosslinked polymer particles are unable to swell with or further imbibe a significant portion of liquid components upon exposure thereto. In this regard, a quantity of crosslinked polymer particles would be said to swell with or imbibe a significant portion of liquid components if it swelled with or has imbibed at least 10% of its own weight of such liquid. Preferably, an amount of crosslinking agent is used to provide a crosslinked polymer having the capacity to imbibe from about 10 to about 500 percent of its own weight of liquid components.</p><p>It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the minimum and maximum values for the proportions of cross- linking agents suitable for inclusion in the crosslinked polymers of this invention will vary depending upon the chemical identity of the component monomers and crosslink- ing agents. In general, however, the crosslinking agents may comprise from as low as about 0.01% to as high as about 100 and preferably from about 0.2% to about 40 by weight of the resulting crosslinked polymer.</p><p>The production of the crosslinked polymer useful in the preferred interpenetrating network embodiment af the invention from monomers and crosslinking agents may be performed by any of the many processes known to those skilled in the art. Thus, the polymers may be formed by heating a mixture of the components to a temperature sufficient to cause polymerization, either with or without the addition of initiators. For this purpose, peroxy type initiators such as benzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide and other materials familiar to those skilled in the art may be employed and the use of activators may be advantageous in some formulations. Alteratively, the crosslinked polymers of the invention may be formed from the consti- tuents by photochemical or radiant initiation utilizing light or high energy radiation.</p><p>The polymerization of the crosslinked polymers may be accomplished in a wide variety of ways alL of which are known to those skilled in the art. Thus, they may be formed by suspension polymerization (as taught by Grim in U.S. Pat. No. 2,673,194), emulsion polymerization, block polymerization. The crosslinked particles preferably have an average particle size should be from about 0.001 micron to about 500 microns. It is preferred that at least 50% by weight of the particles have diameters below 150 microns and more preferably below 100 microns.</p><p>Uncrosslinked Polymer Powders</p><p>In addition to the crosslinked polymers described above, the polymer component of the precursor blend of a preferred embodiment of the invention may comprise an uncrosslinked polymer. Such uncrosslinked polymer include those formed from any of the monofunctional monomer species which have been disclosed above as being useful for the preparation of the crosslinked polymers used in the practice of the invention. Thus, monomer species conforming to the formula above, the acrylic and C.sub.1 to C.sub.6 lower alkyl acrylic esters of aliphatic alcohols having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, or mixtures thereof, are suitable as is vinylidene fluoride. Polymeric methyl methacrylate and copolymers thereof are preferred. The uncrosslinked polymers may be formed from the monomers through any of the polymerization procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus, thermal or photochemical polymerization, either with or without initiators, sensitizers, activators or chain transfer agents may be employed. Similarly, either bulk, suspension or emulsion polymerization may be utilized. Preferably, the uncross- linked polymers should be characterized as having average molecular weight of from about 100,000 to about 2,000,000 g/mole, and especially of from about 500,000 to about 900,000 g/mole. While the polymers are used in particulate form, they differ from the crosslinked polymer filler in that, unlike the crosslinked polymers, the uncrosslinked polymers do not have a critical particle size distribution. Thus, polymer particles or beads of any conveniently small size such as about 50 microns, may be utilized. Smaller sizes are preferred since they imbibe monomers and will dissolve therein more readily, but larger sizes may be used as well.</p><p>Polymerizable Liquid Monomer Blend</p><p>Polymerizable monomers suitable for use in the formulation of the precursor blend of a preferred embodiment of the invention may comprise any of a wide variety of monomers including those previously described examples provided in the preparation of crosslinked and uncrosslinked polymer powder. Thus, acrylic and lower alkyl acrylic acid esters, N-vinyl lactams, acrylimides, acrylamides, acrylonitriles, styrenes, alkenes, urethane acrylate or methacrylate and other monomeric species may be employed in the practice of the invention.</p><p>Especially preferred examples of polymerizable monomers useful in the practice a preferred embodiment of the invention include methyl-, ethyl-, isopropyl-, t- butyl-, octyl-, dodecyl-, cyclohexyl-, chloromethyl-, tetrachloroethyl-, perfluorooctyl-, hydroxyphenyl-, hydroxypropyl-, hydroxybutyl-, 3-hydroxyphenyl-, 4- hydroxyphenyl-, aminoethyl-, aminophenyl-, and thic- phenyl-, acrylate, methacrylate, ethacrylate, propacryl- ate, butacrylate and chloromethacrylate, as well as the homologous mono-acrylic acid esters of bisphenol-A, dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, dihydroxydiphenyl ether, dihy- droxybiphenyl, dihydorxydiphenyl sulfoxide, and 2,2-bis (4- hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)propane Other suitable species will be apparent to those skilled in the art who will further recognize that mixtures of two or more dif- ferent polymerizable monomers may be used.</p><p>Polyfunctional Monomers and Oligomer Components of Polymerizable Liquid Blend</p><p>Preferably, the crosslinking agents for the polymer- izable monomers comprise esters of unsaturated acids, e.g., acrylic, methacrylic, ethacrylic, propacrylic, butacrylic, etc. maleic, fumaric, citraconic, mesaconic, itaconic, malonic, or aconitic, etc., acids. Other unsat- urated acids will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. These acids are preferably reacted with either unsaturated or polyhydroxylic alcohols to form esters which are effective polyfunctional crosslinking agents for the monomeric species useful in the practice of the inven- tion. Thus, useful alcohols include allyl, methallyl, crotyl, vinyl, butenyl, isobutenyl and similar unsaturated alcohols as well as polyols such as ethylene glycol, pro- pylene glycol, butylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tri- ethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, pentaethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dihydroxyphenol, alkylidene bisphenols such as bisphenol- A; 1,1-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) methane; 4,4,-dihydroxy- biphenyl; 4,4-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone; dihydroxydi- phenyl ether; dihydroxydiphenyl sulfoxide; resorcinol; hydroquinone; etc.</p><p>Preferred crosslinking agents used in the practice of the invention include those previously described examples provided for in preparation of crosslinked and uncross- linked polymer powders as well as, the esters of a monomeric dibasic unsaturated acid with an unsaturated monohydroxylic alcohol such as allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, vinyl acrylate (methacrylate and homologs), dimethallyl fumarate, N-allyl acrylamide, crotyl acrylate, allyl crotonate, allyl cinnamate, diallyl maleate, etc. Other preferred species are the di-, tri-, and higher esters of polyhydroxylic alcohols such as ethylene "glycol" diacrylate (dimethacrylate and C.sub.2 -C.sub.6 homologs), trimethlolpropane trimethacrylate, and the dimethacrylate ester of bis-phenol-A as well as other acrylate and allyl acrylate esters. In addition, the crosslinking agent for the polymerizable monomers may be a glycidyl acrylate or allyl acrylate, divinyl (trivinyl or higher homologs) benzene, substituted divinyl benzenes, or analogous com- pounds. Furthermore, mixtures of crosslinking agents are useful in the practice of the invention.</p><p>Compounds such as those described herein above as crosslinking agents and bis- and the urethane dimeth- acrylate formed from the reaction of hydroxyethyl acryl- ate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and their methacrylate homo- logs with 2,4,4-trimethylhexyl-1,6-diisocyanate (herein- after referred to as "urethane dimethacrylate" or "di- acrylate") are especially useful, as are ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate and the dimethacrylate ester of bisphenol-A. The corresponding acrylates are similarly useful as is diallyl maleate.</p><p>Additional Ingredients</p><p>In addition to the components described above, (i.e., crosslinked polymer, uncrosslinked polymer, polymerizable monomer) the precursor blend may contain additional, optional, ingredients, such as, initiators, activators, pigments, fillers, radiopaquing agents, adhesion modi- fiers, free radical or photochemical initiators. In this regard, peroxy type initiators such as dicumyl or benzoyl peroxide are useful. Similarly, pigments and fillers may be added to modify the appearance, density, and physical characteristics of the resultant dental appliances. Inor- ganic materials, especially silica and titania, silicates and aluminates, glasses and ceramics are useful fillers and pigments, and a wide variety of other useful pigments and fillers will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The fillers and radiopaquing agents may constitute a major part by weight of the compositions of the invention. According to a preferred embodiment, the precursor blend of this invention may comprise admires of organic resin components and particulate, inorganic filler in weight ratios of from about 1:2 to about 2:1 or more depending on the specific gravity of inorganic ingredients included.</p><p>Precursor Blends</p><p>The precursor blends in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention are formulated by a mixing together of the constituent species in proper proportion, followed by aging or maturing. Several techniques are available for this and others will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, it is possible to combine crosslinked polymer filler, self-lubricating particles, uncrosslinked polymer and polymerizable liquid blend in proper proportions including therewith, for example, a peroxide initiator and a pigment. This combination is then thoroughly mixed and aged to result in a precursor blend which has a uniform appearance. This blend may have the consistency of dough or may be more or less mobile depending upon the desired use thereof. Particulate inorganic fillers or other modificants may be preferably added at this stage in the formulation of the compositions if desired. The compositions thus formed may be altern- atively molded, extruded, brushed, formed, worked or otherwise shaped in any conventional manner and caused to polymerize or cure to result in hard dental appliances having superior properties. The application of heat or radiant energy is usually required for this polymerization or curing.</p><p>Procedure</p><p>It is especially useful to mold the compositions of this invention into artificial teeth for inclusion in prosthetic devices. It is to be understood, however, that the precursor blends are suitable for a very wide range of dental uses, including fillings, teeth, bridges, crowns, veneers, facings, denture base and denture reline mater- ials, and orthodontic splint materials, and the like. The materials of the invention may also be utilized for prosthetic replacement or repair of various hard body structures such as bone and may be utilized for recon- structive purposes during surgery.</p><p>The nature of the chemical and physical relationships among the components of the precursor blends of the invention is important to the practice of the invention. Among these relationships is the necessity that the crosslinked polymer particles be capable of swelling by imbibing the liquid components of similar importance is the requirement that the uncrosslinked polymers, when included, be capable of dissolving in the liquid compon- ents. The precursor blend formed by any of the useful techniques described above is aged for a period of time sufficient to insure that in one embodiment the cross- linked polymer has become substantially fully swollen with, interpenetrated by or has substantially imbibed the liquid crosslinking blend and that the uncrosslinked polymer, if used, has at least partially been dissolved therein. Thus, as used herein, "aged" or "aging" refer to the maintenance of the components of the precursor blend in association with one another in the blend for a period of time sufficient to substantially fully swell the crosslinked polymer particles with the mixture of poly- merizable monomer and crosslinking agent dissolved therein. Frequently, aging is manifested by a change in the consistency of the mixture as equilibrium is approached. The time necessary to approach such equilib- rium will vary depending upon the blending techniques, the relative proportions of materials, the particle sizes and molecular weights of the polymers and the temperature extent in the mixtures. In general, aging time of from one to seven days has been found to be adequate to approach the desired equilibrium. It is to be understood that it lies well within the abilities of those skilled in the art to ascertain the optimum aging time for a formu- lation in view of the foregoing considerations. In accordance with this preferred technique, powder com- ponents includig self-lubricating abrasion resistant particles are blended with a polymerizable liquid blend. The precursor blend is then aged for a period of time sufficient to permit the crosslinked polymer particles to be substantially fully swollen with, or interpenetrated by polymerizable blend. Precursor blends thus formed may be alternatively molded, brushed, extruded, formed, worked or otherwise shaped to form useful dental devices and art- icles. Other techniques are presented in the examples which follow, and still others will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p><p>Upon polymerization of the precursor blends in one embodiment a three dimensional structure is believed to be formed which may be denominated as an interpenetrating polymeric network. The interpenetrating network structure which is believed to form is a major contributing factor to the serendipitous combination of superior chemical and physiochemical properties which is exhibited by the art- icles constructed according to the practice of the inven- tion. Interpenetrating polymeric networks are related to, but distinct from, traditional graft polymers.</p><p>In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention a self-lubricating interpenetrating network may be viewed as being composed of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene dispersed within two or more crosslinked, and hence three dimensionally arrayed, polymeric networks which do not necessarily have any covalent bonds in common. While the two networks may, indeed, be inde- pendent in the sense that they need possess no covalent linkages between them; they are physically trapped one "within" the other and cannot disassociate by any physical manipulation without the rupture of covalent bonds. Particalate crosslinked polymer is allowed to swell with or imbibe monomer mixed with crosslinking agent, and when the imbibed mixture of monomer and crosslinking agent is subsequently caused to polymerize, an interpenetrating polymeric network may be seen to be formed within the confines of the particulate crosslinked polymer. It is believed that the aging process employed in the prepa- ration of the precursor blends of the invention is required to accomplish substantially full swelling with interpenetration by or substantially complete inhibition of crosslinking agent by the crosslinked polymer part- icles, and to approach an equilibrium thereof.</p><p>The American Dental Association specification number 15 specifies, "the strength of the bond between tooth and resin is tested in tension. The minimum bond strength is 30.9 MN/M.sup.2 (4,480 psi; 315 Kg/cm.sup.2), which is sufficient to prevent separation of the teeth from the resin denture base in use." This pertains to "acrylic denture base resin polymerized by the heat processing technique." The compositions of this invention meet or exceed tis speci- fication.</p><p>A unique, heterogeneous microstructure is exhibited by one embodiment, the preferred interpenetrating network embodiment of the invention. One exemplary method for observing this microstructure is as follows:</p><p>1. The tooth, or molded article, is sectioned and one section potted in epoxy against a flat surface.</p><p>2. The sectioned surface of the potted specimen is polished to a smooth surface using Nos. 320, 400 and 600 grit silicon carbide papers wet continu- ously with water.</p><p>3. A final polish is obtained using an aqueous slurry of 0.3 micron Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 on a chamais.</p><p>4. The polished surface of the section is exposed for four minutes to the vapors of boiling concentrated nitric acid; the microstructure is oxidatively exposed by this etching procedure and is best captured by photomicrography at 260 x magnification.</p><p>The microstructure thus observed is heterogeneous and comprises what may best be described as particles suspended in a matrix. The particles are believed to be identifiable with the particulate crosslinked polymers of the precursor blend which have been swollen by and inter- penetrated with the monomer and crosslinking agent. By comparison with conventional composite compositions containing only rigid inorganic fillers, the articles formed according to the present invention exhibit a micro- structure in which the structure is much more closely packed. It is to be understood that this methodology, while of wide application in the examination of the micro- structure of the novel compositions of the invention, is not exclusive. Other techniques involving greater or lesser magnification and other means of visualization are also useful in disclosing the structure. Distributed throughout this structure is particulate self-lubricating particles.</p><p>Preferably teeth formed in accordance with a pre- ferred embodiment of the invention are from 0.1 to 80 percent by weight self-lubricating material having a kinetic coefficient of friction less than 0.25 when measured using D 1894-78 and 5 psi.</p><p>Preferably, the self-lubricating materials for use in accordance with the invention have an average largest dimension (or diameter) from 0.5 to 80 microns. More preferably, such particles have an average largest dimension (or diameter) less than 70 microns. Most preferably, the self-lubricating particles for use in accordance with the invention have an average largest dimension (or diameter) from 1 to 80 microns. Most preferably, the self-lubricating particles for use in accordance with the invention have an average largest dimension (or diameter) from 2 to 20 microns. A preferred embodiment of the invention provides a tooth including polyethylene having a molecular weight of at least 500,000 and preferably a molecular weight of at least 1,000,000, and a particle size less than 80 microns. In a preferred embodiment of the invention a dental prosthesis is pro- vided including polyethylene particles having a particle size less than 8o microns and a molecular weight of at least 3,000,000 functionalized by gas plasma treatment so as to be bondable to the matrix polymer.</p><p>The following examples describe certain represent- ative embodiments of this invention and will serve further to illustrate the nature thereof.

The crosslinked copolymer completely absorbed the monomer solution during the one week "pre-swell" period.
