useful in the filed of drugs. Said compounds act as antagonists to

preventing or treating agents of various diseases of cardiovascular
system, nervous system, metabolic systems, reproductive system,
respiratory system, digestive system and the like.</p><heading><u style="single"><b>Background Art</b></u></heading><p num="0002">Melanin concentrating hormone (hereafter abbreviated as
"MCH") is a cyclic peptide hormone/neuro-peptide, which was for the
first time isolated by Kawauchi, et al. in 1983 from sermon
hypophysis [Nature, Vol. 305, 321 (1983)]. The hormone is known to
functionally antagonize to melanin cell stimulating hormone in fishes,
to cause concentration of melanin granules in melanophore and
participate in body color change [International Review of Cytology, Vol.
126, 1(1991); Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Vol. 5, 120
(1994)]. Also in mammals, MCH-containing neuron nerve cells are
localized in the hypothalamus lateral field and uncertain zone, but
their nerve fibers are projecting over a very wide scope in the brain
[The Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 319, 218 (1992)], and
MCH is considered to preside over various central functions in living
bodies.</p><p num="0003">Hypothalamus lateral field is known of old as feeding center,
and furthermore, recently molecular biological and pharmacological
knowledges suggesting participation of MCH in controlling energetic
homeostasis are being accumulated. That is, it has been reported that
expression of mRNA, which is a MCH precursor, was accelerated in
brains of ob/ob mouse, db/db mouse, A<sup>y</sup>/a mouse, Zucker fatty rat or 
the like which are model animals of hereditary obesity, or in brains of
fasted mice [Nature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996); Diabetes, Vol. 47, 294
(1998); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol.
268, 88 (2000); Molecular Brain Research, Vol. 92, 43 (2000)].</p><p num="0004">Acute ventricular administration of MCH to rats was observed
to induce accelerated feeding activity [Nature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996)]
and chronic administration invites obesity accompanied by polyphagy
[Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States
of America, Vol. 99, 3240, (2002)]. Moreover, MCH precursor
gene-deficient mouse shows reduced food ingestion or rise in oxygen
consumption per body weight compared to wild type mice. Its low
body weight due to decrease in body fat was observed [Nature, Vol.
396, 670 (1998)].</p><p num="0005">On the contrary, transgenic mouse which expresses excessive
MCH precursor develops obesity accompanied by polyphagy and
insulin resistance [The Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 107, 379
(2001)]. Consequently, it is suggested that MCH is an important
factor for developing obesity and participates in diseases induced by
metabolic disorder or respiratory diseases of which one of risk factors
is obesity. Besides, MCH is known to participate also in
anxiety-causing action, epilepsy, memory, learning, diuretic action,
excretory action of sodium and potassium, oxytocin secreting action,
reproduction and reproductive function [Peptides, Vol. 17, 171 (1996);
Peptides, Vol. 18, 1095 (1997), Peptides, Vol, 15, 757 (1994); Journal of
Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 8, 57 (1996); Critical Reviews in
Neurobiology, Vol. 8, 221, (1994)].</p><p num="0006">MCH causes versatile pharmacological actions through MCH
receptors which are present mainly in the central nervous system.
As receptors of MCH, at least two types of type 1 receptors (MCH-1R
or SLC-1) and type 2 receptors (MCH-2R or SLT) are known [Nature,
Vol. 400, 261 (1999); Nature, Vol. 400, 265 (1999); Biochemical and
Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 261, 622 (1999); Nature
Cell Biology, Vol. 1, 267 (1999); FEBS Letters, Vol. 457, 522 (1999);
Biochemical and Physical Research Communications, Vol. 283, 1013
(2001); The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 20125 (2001); 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
of America, Vol. 98, 7564 (2001); Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 98, 7576 (2001); The
Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 34664 (2001); and Molecular
Pharmacology, Vol. 60, 632 (2001)].</p><p num="0007">Of those, the pharmacological action observed on rodents is
induced mainly via MCH-1R [Genomics, Vol. 79, 785(2002)].

Because MCH-1R gene-deficient mice chronically administered with
MCH do not develop polyphagy or obesity, it is known that controlling
of energy exchange by MCH is induced via MCH-1R. Furthermore,
deficiency of MCH-1R promotes activity amount of mouse
[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
of America, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002)], and its participation in central
diseases accompanied by behavioral disorder, for example,
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and the like
also is strongly suggested [Molecular Medicine Today, Vol. 6, 43
(2000); Trends in Neuroscience, Vol. 24, 527 (2001)].</p><p num="0008">It is also reported that autoantibody to MCH-1R is present in
serum of vitiligo vulgaris patient [The Journal of Clinical
Investigation, Vol. 109, 923 (2002)]. Furthermore, expression of
MCH-1R in certain species of cancer cells was reported, and <u style="single">in</u><u style="single">vivo</u>
expression sites of MCH and MCH-1R also suggest their participation
in cancer, sleep, vigil, drug dependence and digestive disorders
[Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 289, 44
(2001); Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 61, 348 (1995); Endocrinology, Vol.
137, 561 (1996); The Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 435, 26
(2001)].</p><p num="0009">Functions of MCH are expressed upon its binding to MCH
receptors. Therefore, when its binding to MCH receptor is inhibited,
expression of MCH action can be inhibited. In consequence,
substances which are antagonists to binding of MCH with its receptor
are useful as preventing or treating agent of those various diseases in
which MCH participates, for example, metabolic disorders
represented by obesity, diabetes, hormone disorder, hyperlipidemia,
gout, fatty liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis; cardiovascular disorders,

mixture (207 mg) of tert-butyl 5-[(t-butoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino]-2-[isopropyl(methyl)amino-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxylate
and tert-butyl
6-[(t-butoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino]-2-[isopropyl(methyl)amino]-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxylate.</li><li>(3) Thus obtained mixture (207 mg) of tert-butyl
5-[(t-butoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino]- 2-[isopropyl(methyl)amino-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxylate
and tert-butyl 6-[(t-butoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino]-
2-[isopropyl(methyl)amino]-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxylate
was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (2 ml) and stirred for
3.5 hours. The reaction liquid was made alkaline by addition of
4N-aqueous NaOH solution and extracted with chloroform. The
organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate to provide an oily substance (117 mg).

Thus obtained amine-form (61 mg) was dissolved in
dimethylformamide (2.5 ml), and to the solution carboxylic acid (61
mg), WSC•HCl (67 mg), HOBt•monohydrate (47 mg) and sodium
hydrogencarbonate (79 mg) were added, followed by stirring at room
temperature for 15 hours. Water was added and the system was
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with
saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The
organic layer was condensed under reduced pressure and purified on
preparative TLC (methanol/chloroform = 1/9) to provide the title
compound (34 mg).
