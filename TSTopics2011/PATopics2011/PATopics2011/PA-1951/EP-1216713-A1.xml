low dosages of these active ingredients. Given the small amounts of active ingredient
required per single dosage, often ranging between 0.1 Âµg and 500 Âµg, content uniformity
of the preparation is a significant contributor to fluctuations in actual doses of these active
ingredients.</p><p num="0004">Similarly, the oxidative degradation of these small amounts of active ingredient is a further
contributor to the strong fluctuations of the active ingredient in low dosage formulations. In
low dosage formulations, these fluctuations are critical to quality assurance.</p><p num="0005">In general, these low dose formulations are problematic in terms of their preparation,
storage and use.</p><p num="0006">US 4,596,795 discloses a complex between Î±-, Î²- and Î³-cyclodextrins and derivatives

an estrogen wherein the stability of said estrogen is significantly improved over that of
conventional formulations without complexed estrogens. Degradation of estrogens, such
as ethinyl estradiol, in conventional formulations is one of the most critical issue with
regard to product shelf life. The stabilisation of the estrogen may be achieved by either
product packaging in hermetic containers (e.g. pouch) or, more effectively, by actual
stabilisation of the formulation.</p><p num="0011">It has surprisingly been found that a complex of cyclodextrin and estrogen significantly
improves the stability of the estrogen and consequently the shelf-life of an estrogen-containing
composition. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
composition comprising an inclusion complex between cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof,
and an estrogen, wherein the composition is such that said estrogen has a 12-month
stability at 40Â°C and 75% relative humidity (RH) corresponding to a decrease in the
content of said estrogen of at the most 10% w/w, such as at the most 5, 4, 3, or 2% w/w,
based on the total content of said estrogen, together with one or more pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers or excipients.</p><p num="0012">Moreover, an alternative embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
composition comprising an inclusion complex between cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof,
and an estrogen, wherein the composition is such that said estrogen has a 12-month
stability at 25Â°C and 60% relative humidity (RH) corresponding to a decrease in the
content of said estrogen of at the most 10% w/w, such as at the most 5, 4, 3 or 2% w/w, 
based on the total content of said estrogen, together with one or more pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers or excipients.</p><p num="0013">The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an
inclusion complex between cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof, and estrogen wherein the
composition is such that said estrogen has a 12-month stability at 40Â°C and 75% relative
humidity (RH) corresponding to a decrease in the content of said estrogen of at the most
10%, such as at the most 5, 4, 3 or 2% based on the total content of estrogen, and a
therapeutically active compound, such as a gestagen, such as drospirenone, together
with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.</p><p num="0014">Furthermore, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an
inclusion complex between a cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof, and an estrogen,
suitably formulated such that the total amount of oxidant is such that said estrogen has a
12-month stability at 40Â°C and 75% relative humidity (RH) corresponding to a decrease in
the content of said estrogen of at the most 10% w/w, such as at the most 5, 4, or 3% w/w,
based on the total content of said estrogen, together with one or more pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers or excipients.</p><p num="0015">Compositions of the present invention may be used as medicaments. Accordingly, the use
of a composition described infra for the preparation of a pharmaceutical for female
contraception, for hormone replacement therapy, for the treatment of menopausal, pre-menopausal,
and/or post-menopausal symptoms, for the treatment of acne or for the
treatment of PMDD is a further aspect of the present invetion.</p><p num="0016">As the formulation of the complex is another important aspect to achieve the improved
effects, the present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical particulate formulation of
a composition, said composition comprising an inclusion complex between a cyclodextrin,
or derivative thereof, wherein the total amount of oxidant in said formulation is such that
said estrogen has a 12-month stability at 40Â°C and 75% relative humidity (RH)
corresponding to a decrease in the content of said estrogen of at the most 10% w/w, such
as at the most 5, 4, or 3% w/w, based on the total content of said estrogen.</p><p num="0017">Alternatively measured, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical particulate
formulation of a composition, said composition comprising an inclusion complex between 
a cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof, wherein the total amount of oxidant in said
formulation is such that said estrogen has a 3-month stability at 60Â°C and 75% relative
humidity (RH) corresponding to a decrease in content of said estrogen of at the most 15%
w/w, such as at the most 10, 9, 8, 7, or 6% w/w, based on the total content of said
estrogen.</p><p num="0018">Still further, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical particulate formulation of a
composition, said composition comprising an inclusion complex between a cyclodextrin,
or derivative thereof, wherein the total amount of oxidant in said formulation is such that
said ethinyl estradiol has a 12-month stability at 25Â°C and 60% relative humidity (RH)
such that the sum product of the degradation products 6-Î±-hydroxy-ethinyl estradiol, 6-Î²-hydroxy-ethinyl
estradiol, 6-keto- ethinyl estradiol and Î9,11-ethinyl estradiol of said
ethinyl estradiol totals at the most 0.8%, such as at the most 0.7% and 0.6%, based on
the total content of estrogen.</p><p num="0019">In a broad sense, the present invention relates a method of improving the stability of
ethinyl estradiol in a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the step of a) complexing said
ethinyl estradiol with cyclodextrin, and optionally of b) limiting the polyvinylpyrrolidone
content to less than 5%, such as less than 4%, such as less than 3%, such as less than
2%, such as less than 1%, such as providing a substantially polyvinylpyrrolidone-free
formulation.</p><p num="0020">Generally, an object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition
comprising an estrogen wherein the stability of said estrogen is significantly improved
over that of conventional formulations.</p><heading><b>DETAILED DESCIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p num="0021">The term "complex" is intended to mean an inclusion complex between estrogen and
cyclodextrin, wherein a molecule of said estrogen is at least partially inserted into the
cavity of one or more cyclodextrin molecules, wherein for example two moieties of a
single estrogen molecule are each inserted into one cyclodextrin molecule to give 2:1 ratio
between cyclodextrin and estrogen. Similarly, the complex may comprise of more than
one molecule of estrogen at least partially inserted into one or more cyclodextrin 
molecules, wherein for example 2 estrogen molecules are at least partially inserted into a
single cyclodextrin molecule, to give a 1:2 ratio between cyclodextrin and estrogen.
Complexes wherein one estrogen molecule is complexed with one or more cyclodextrin
molecules are certainly anticipated such as 1 estrogen molecule complexed with 2
cyclodextrin molecules or 3 cyclodextrin molecules. Typically, the ethinyl estradiol-Î²-cyclodextrin
inclusion complex as prepared by the present invention is preferably a
complex between one molecule of ethinyl estradiol and two molecules of Î²-Cyclodextrin.</p><p num="0022">The term "ethinyl estradiol-Î²-Cyclodextrin inclusion complex" or "EE-Î²-CD" is intended to
mean a complex, of any ratio, between ethinyl estradiol and Î²-cyclodextrin.</p><p num="0023">The term "oxidant-free" relates to formulations substantially devoid of all agents having
substantial oxidizing capacity whereas the term "oxidant-restricted" relates to formulations
substantially devoid of at least one agent having substantial oxidizing capacity. For
example, a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free formulation is an oxidant-restricted formulation.</p><p num="0024">The present investigators have developed formulations wherein a remarkable
improvement of the stability of the estrogen ethinyl estradiol (EE) has been achieved by
individual or combined means. One such means is the protection of EE by forming a Î²-cyclodextrin
complex. Another such means is by the judicious selection of additives and
excipients to the formulation such that oxidants are minimised or excluded from the
formulation. Individually, or acting in concert, these means have resulted in formulations
wherein said estrogen has a 12-month stability at 40Â°C and 75% relative humidity (RH)
corresponding to a decrease in the content of said estrogen of between 3 and 10 % w/w,
compared to conventional formulations wherein estrogen degrades by up to 25% under
identical conditions (see Table 1.3, Example 1). Thus, a preferred embodiment of the
invention is that of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inclusion complex
between cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof, and an estrogen, wherein the composition is
such that said estrogen has a 12-month stability at 40Â°C and 75% relative humidity (RH)
corresponding to a decrease in the content of said estrogen of at the most 10% w/w, such
as at the most 5, 4, or 3% w/w, based on the total content of said estrogen, together with
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.</p><p num="0025">It is evident that the stability test may be performed under alternative conditions such as
higher temperatures. Thus an alternative embodiment wherein the composition is such 
that said estrogen has a 3-month stability at 60Â°C and 75% relative humidity (RH)
corresponding to a decrease in content of said estrogen of at the most 15% w/w, such as
at the most 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, or 5% w/w, based on the total content of said estrogen.</p><p num="0026">As stated, the formulation of the estrogen-cyclodextrin complex is critical to achieve the
desired effect of improved stability of a composition comprising said complex. The present
inventors have developed a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inclusion complex
between a cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof, and an estrogen, suitably formulated such
that the total amount of oxidant is such that said estrogen has a 12-month stability at 40Â°C
and 75% relative humidity (RH) corresponding to a decrease in the content of said
estrogen of at the most 10% w/w, such as at the most 5, 4, or 3% w/w, based on the total
content of said estrogen, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
or excipients.</p><p num="0027">An embodiment of an oxidant-restricted formulation (see Table 1.3, Example 1)
comprising EE complexed with Î²CD compares surprisingly well with known formulations
in 3-month stability studies at 60Â°C and 75% relative humidity (RH), wherein a less than
4% decrease in EE content was observed in said embodiment compared to an almost
30% decrease was observed in known formulations or free-estrogen formulations.</p><p num="0028">As the person skilled in the art will appreciate, the estrogen may be selected from the
group consisting of ethinyl estradiol (EE), estradiol, estradiol sulfamates, estradiol
valerate, estradiol benzoate, estrone, estriol, estriol succinate and conjugated estrogens,
including conjugated equine estrogens such as estrone sulfate, 17Î²-estradiol sulfate, 17Î±-estradiol
sulfate, equilin sulfate, 17Î²-dihydroequilin sulfate, 17Î±-dihydroequilin sulfate,
equilenin sulfate, 17Î²-dihydroequilenin sulfate and17Î±-dihydroequilenin sulfate or
mixtures thereof. Particularly interesting estrogens are selected from the group consisting
of ethinyl estradiol (EE), estradiol, estradiol sulfamates, estradiol valerate, estradiol
benzoate, estrone, and estrone sulfate or mixtures thereof, notably ethinyl estradiol (EE),
estradiol, estradiol valerate, estradiol benzoate and estradiol sulfamates. Most preferred is
ethinyl estradiol (EE).</p><p num="0029">In the preferred embodiment wherein the estrogen is ethinyl estradiol (EE), some of the
degradation products are well known. Thus it is possible to express the stability of the
formulation in terms of the amount of these degradation products. Accordingly, the 
composition according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises an inclusion
complex between cyclodextrin, or derivative thereof, and ethinyl estradiol, wherein the
composition is such that said ethinyl estradiol has a 12-month stability at 25Â°C and 60%
relative humidity (RH) such that the sum product of the degradation products 6-Î±-hydroxy-ethinyl
estradiol, 6-Î²-hydroxy-ethinyl estradiol, 6-keto-ethinyl estradiol, Î9,11-ethinyl
estradiol and Î6,7-ethinyl estradiol of said ethinyl estradiol totals at the most 0.8%, such
as at the most 0.7% and 0.6%, based on the total content of estrogen, together with one
or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.</p><p num="0030">A pharmaceutical composition comprising an inclusion complex between a cyclodextrin,

humidity (RH) such that the sum product of the degradation products 6-Î±-hydroxy-ethinyl
estradiol, 6-Î²-hydroxy-ethinyl estradiol, 6-keto-ethinyl estradiol, Î6,7-ethinyl estradiol and
Î-9,11-ethinyl estradiol of said ethinyl estradiol totals at the most 3%, such as at the most

of modifying these alcohols are well known to the person skilled in the art and many are
commercially available. Thus, some or all of the hydroxyls of cyclodextrin may modified
cyclodextrins have be substituted with an O-R group or an O-C(O)-R, wherein R is an
optionally substituted C<sub>1-6</sub> alkyl, an optionally substituted C<sub>2-6</sub> alkenyl, an optionally 
substituted C<sub>2-6</sub> alkynyl, an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl group. Thus, R may be
methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, or hexyl group. Consequently, O-C(O)-R may be an
acetate. Furthermore, with the commonly employed 2-hydroxyethyl group, or 2-hydroxypropyl
group R may be used to derivatize cyclodextrin. Moreover, the cyclodextrin
alcohols may be per-benzylated, per-benzoylated, or benzylated or benzoylated on just
one face of the macrocycle, or wherein only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hydroxyls are benzylated or
benzoylated. Naturally, the cyclodextrin alcohols may be per-alkylated or per-acylated
such as per-methylated or per-acetylated, or alkylated or acylated, such as methylated or
acetylated, on just one face of the macrocycle, or wherein only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hydroxyls
are alkylated or acylated, such as methylated or acetylated.

comprising an estrogen wherein the stability of said estrogen is significantly improved
over that of conventional formulations. Degradation of estrogens, such as ethinyl
estradiol, in conventional formulations is the most critical issue with regard to product
shelf life. One means of increasing the stability of an estrogen such as ethinyl estradiol
(EE) in a composition is by the judicious selection of additives and excipients to the
formulation such that oxidants are minimised or excluded from the formulation.</p><p num="0049">Thus, the formulation of the compositions of the present invention is also critical. The gain
stability of the estrogen by means of complexation with cyclodextrin must be maintained in
the formulation. A vigilant control of the amount of oxidant used in formulation is critical to
maintaining the stability of the estrogen. Consequently, the present invention relates to a
pharmaceutical particulate formulation of a composition, said composition comprising an

of oxidant in said formulation is such that said estrogen has a 12-month stability at 40Â°C

conditions are investigated with respect to their solid state form. A selection of the
following analytical methods is applied in order to identify and characterise solid state
forms as deemed appropriate and possible:
<sl><li>X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD)</li><li>differential thermal analysis (DTA) in combination with thermogravimetry (TG)</li><li>differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in combination with thermogravimetry (TG)</li></sl></p><heading><i>Summary of Results</i></heading><p num="0118">Evidences of complex formation is obtained by investigation of pure ethinyl estradiol and
beta-cyclodextrin, mechanical mixtures of both substances as well as samples of the
ethinyl estradiol-beta-cyclodextrin complex with X-ray powder diffraction and thermal
analysis. According to these investigations at least about 90 % of the ethinyl estradiol
should be bonded in the complex. </p><p num="0119">The prevalent form of the ethinyl estradiol-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex is that of a
hydrate containing varying amounts of water. The variability of the water content is a
consequence of an inherent property of free cyclodextrin as well as of its inclusion
compounds (inclusion complexes or clathrates), the equilibration of at least part of the
hydrate water with the ambient atmosphere. On storage, an equilibrium water content is
established which depends on temperature, pressure and relative humidity. The hydrate
water can be readily lost from the crystal lattice. Under more servere drying conditions all
crystal water can be removed, however the resulting material is extremely hygroscopic
and therefore not of relevance for the drug substance. The same applies to a fully water-saturated
hydrate which is stable only in the presence of mother liquid or under relative
humidity of more than 97 %. Thus, any discussion on the solid state forms of the ethinyl
estradiol-Î²-cyclodextrin complex has to concentrate on the characterisation of a range of
hydrates having intermediate water contents with an upper limit at water saturation.</p><p num="0120">The hydrate water is a part of the crystal lattice and therefore alterations of the water
content are connected with changes in the crystal lattice. This is manifested by
differences in the X-ray powder pattern of batches of clathrate with varying water content.
According to these patterns four different types can be distinguished. Batches of type I
contain less than 1 % water. In batches of types II and III between 4 % and 10 % water,
and 8 % and 15 % water, respectively, are found. Type IV is characterised by a water
content of more than 15 %. However, there's no clear dividing line between two
neighbouring types. The position of the diffraction peaks is changed gradual due to
swelling and shrinking of the crystal lattice during water sorption or desorption.
Investigations of the four types by differential thermal analysis in combination with
thermogravimetry have shown that the dehydration takes place between 25Â°C and 170Â°C.
The different forms are readily and reversibly interchanged by adjustment of the ambient
humidity conditions. This behaviour indicates considerable rigidity of the structural
framework which does not allow profound alteration of the basic arrangement of the beta-cyclodextrin/ethinyl
estradiol building blocks of the solid during hydration and dehydration.</p><heading><b>Example 12</b></heading><heading><i>Preparation of the ethinyl estradiol-beta-cyclodextrin complex</i></heading><p num="0121">The ethinyl estradiol-beta-cyclodextrin complex is obtained by co-precipitation as follows: <sl><li>Process 1 (P1):âââEthinyl estradiol is dissolved in ethanol.
