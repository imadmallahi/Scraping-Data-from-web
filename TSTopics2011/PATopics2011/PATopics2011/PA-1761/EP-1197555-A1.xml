various specific systems exist for their cellular
transmembrane transport. Moreover, most of bacteria can
respond to environmental changes to survive under a
limited nutritious condition. Their cells are provided
with a detector for monitoring the environment to select
their nutrition from various carbon sources. Examples
of such transmembrane transport systems and detectors of
sugars include PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate/carbohydrate
phosphotransferase system or phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar
transport system; as for PTS, refer to <i>Escherichia coli</i>
and <i>Salmonella</i> Cellular and Molecular Biology, Second
Edition, ASM (American Society for Microbiology) Press).</p> <p num="0003">PTS is involved in regulation of transmembrane
transport and phosphorylation of various sugars (PTS
sugars), movement towards these carbon sources and many
metabolic pathways. PTS catalyzes the following 
reaction. PEP refers to phosphoenolpyruvic acid.
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/" align="center">PEP (intracellular) + Sugar (extracellular) --&gt;<st32:break type="required"/>

phosphorylated sugar and pyruvic acid by translocating a
phosphate group of intracellular phosphoenolpyruvic acid
(also referred to as "PEP" hereafter) to an
extracellular sugar. The phosphorylation of a sugar is
linked with cellular transmembrane transport of a sugar,
and energies required for these processes are supplied
from PEP, which is an intermediate of the glycolytic
pathway.</p><p num="0005">In <i>Escherichia coil</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>,
proteins constituting PTS catalyze the following
reactions.

(Enzyme I) and Hpr (histidine protein) are soluble
cytoplasmic proteins involved in phosphorylation of all 
PTS sugars and referred to as general PTS proteins.</p><p num="0007">On the other hand, EII (Enzyme II) is specific for
PTS sugars and consists of several domains or proteins
depending on the sugars. For example, the mannitol-specific
EII is a membrane-bound protein consisting of
three domains, A, B and C. The glucose-specific EII and
sucrose-specific EII consist of IIB and IIC, which are
membrane-bound proteins, and IIA, which is a soluble
protein. In any case, translocation of a phosphate
group from PEP to a sugar is mediated by EI, HPr, EIIA
and EIIB. The EIIC domain, which is an intramembranous
portion of EII, forms a translocation channel and is
considered to be probably a specific binding site of a
substrate.</p> <p num="0008">The third type of EII is observed in mannose PTS.
Both of its domains A and B are fused in a single
soluble polypeptide, and the two intramembranous
proteins (IIC and IID) are involved in transmembrane
transport of mannose.</p> <p num="0009">In <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>,
the gene encoding EI (ptsI) has been cloned and
sequenced (Saffen, E.W. <i>et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262</i>,
pp.16241-16253, 1987; De Reuse, H. and Danchin, A., <i>J.
Bacteriol., 170</i>, pp.3827-3837, 1988). Further, EII
specific for some sugars have also been cloned (Saffen,
E.W. <i>et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262,</i> pp.16241-16253, 1987;
Erni, B. and Zanolari, B., <i>J. Biol. Chem., 261</i>, 
pp.16398-16403, 1986; Nelson, S.O. <i>et al., EMBO J., 3,</i>
pp.1587-1593, 1984).</p> <p num="0010">It is known that some kinds of sugars are taken up
by non-PTS, which do not require PEP, as a system for
uptake into cells.</p><heading><u style="single">Disclosure of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0011">As described above, many studies about uptake of
sugar into cells have been performed, but studies about
PTS in industrially useful coryneform bacteria have not
made much progress. Accordingly, an object of the
present invention is to provide a gene encoding a
protein constituting sucrose PTS in coryneform bacterium.</p><p num="0012">The inventors of the present application isolated
a DNA fragment including a gene encoding sucrase
(invertase) of coryneform bacterium and determined its
structure. Further, they developed a method for
producing an amino acid or a nucleic acid by using a
coryneform bacterium containing the amplified sucrase
gene (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (Kokai) Nos.
5-244958 and 8-196280). In the DNA fragment, four open
reading frames (ORF-F1, ORF-F2, ORF-F3 and ORF-F4) exist
in a <i>Sma</i>I fragment of about 6 kb.</p><p num="0013">However, the inventors of the present invention
considered based on comparison with other sucrase genes
that the aforementioned ORF-F2 did not contain the
sucrase gene in full length. That is, the number of 
amino acid residues in sucrase estimated from known
sucrase genes is 466 to 511 (Gunaseakren, P., <i>J.
Bacteriol., 172</i> (12), pp.6727-35, 1990), whereas the
amino acid sequence that can be encoded by ORF-F2
contains 424 amino acid residues, which was relatively
short. Therefore, a sequence existing downstream from
ORF-F2 was cloned again and its nucleotide sequence was
determined. As a result, it was revealed that the DNA
fragment containing the aforementioned sucrase gene
consisted of two independent cloned fragments ligated to
each other, and it was found that a novel gene encoding
sucrose PTS enzyme II existed downstream from the
sucrase gene. Thus, the present invention was
accomplished.</p><p num="0014">That is, the present invention provides a protein
defined in the following (A) or (B):
<sl><li>(A) a protein which has the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 2 in Sequence Listing;</li><li>(B) a protein which has the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 2 in Sequence Listing including substitution,
deletion, insertion, addition or inversion of one or
several amino acids, and an activity for binding to
sucrose.</li></sl></p><p num="0015">The present invention also provides a DNA which
encodes a protein defined in the following (A) or (B):
<sl><li>(A) a protein which has the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 2 in Sequence Listing; </li><li>(B) a protein which has the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 2 in Sequence Listing including substitution,

the following (a) or (b):
<sl><li>(a) a DNA which contains the nucleotide sequence
of the nucleotides 3779 to 5761 of SEQ ID NO: 1 in
Sequence Listing;</li><li>(b) a DNA which is hybridizable with a nucleotide
sequence containing the nucleotide sequence of the
nucleotides 3779 to 5761 of SEQ ID NO: 1 in Sequence
Listing under a stringent condition, and encodes a
protein having an activity for binding to sucrose.</li></sl></p><heading><u style="single">Brief Description of the Drawings</u></heading><p num="0017"><sl><li>Fig. 1 shows a construction process of a plasmid
for disrupting the sucrose PTS enzyme II gene.</li><li>Fig. 2 shows a construction process of pBCT4.</li></sl></p><heading><u style="single">Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention</u></heading><p num="0018">Hereafter, the present invention will be explained
in detail.</p><p num="0019">The DNA of the present invention was obtained, in
the examples described later, by amplifying a region
existing downstream from the sucrase gene on chromosomal 
DNA of <i>Brevibacterium lactofermentum</i> by PCR (polymerase
chain reaction).</p><p num="0020">A region adjacent to a known region on a
chromosomal DNA can be amplified by ligating a cassette
to a DNA fragment containing the regions and performing
PCR using a primer corresponding to the known region and
a primer corresponding to the cassette. At this time,
if the 5' end of the cassette is dephosphorylated
beforehand, a nick is generated at a ligation site of
the chromosomal DNA fragment and 5' end of the cassette.
Therefore, DNA synthesis started from the cassette
primer will be stopped at this ligation site, and only
the DNA synthesized from a synthetic primer will serves
as a template for synthesis starting from the cassette
primer and a complementary chain will be formed. As a
result, specific amplification becomes possible
(cassette-ligation mediated PCR method (<i>Molecular and
Cellular Probes, 6,</i> pp.467-475)). A kit utilizing this
method is commercially available (TAKARA LA PCR™ in
vitro Cloning Kit, Takara Shuzo) and can be utilized to
obtain the DNA of the present invention.</p><p num="0021">Since the nucleotide sequences of the DNA of the
present invention and the adjacent region thereof have
been revealed, they can be directly amplified by PCR
using oligonucleotides synthesized based on these
nucleotide sequences as primers and chromosomal DNA of
coryneform bacterium as a template. Examples of such 
primers include oligonucleotides having the nucleotide
sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 10 and 21. Further, the DNA of
the present invention can also be isolated from a
chromosomal DNA library by hybridization using an
oligonucleotide synthesized based on these nucleotide
sequences as a probe. The chromosomal DNA of coryneform
bacterium can be obtained by, for example, the method of
Saito <i>et al.</i> (described in <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 72</i>,
pp.619-629, 1963) or the method of K. S. Kirby (<i>Biochem.
J., 64,</i> p.405, 1956).</p><p num="0022">Further, conventional methods well known to those
skilled in the art can be employed for preparation of
chromosomal DNA, preparation of chromosomal DNA library,
hybridization, PCR, preparation of plasmid DNA,
digestion and ligation of DNA, transformation, design of
oligonucleotides used as primers and so forth. These
methods are described in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F.,
and Maniatis, T., "Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual,
Second Edition", Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,
1989 and so forth.</p><p num="0023">Plasmids used for cloning of the DNA of the
present invention, preparation of a chromosomal DNA
library or the like may be those that can replicate in
microorganisms such as bacteria belonging to the genus
<i>Escherichia</i>, and specific examples thereof include
pBR322, pTWV228, pMW119, pUC19 and so forth.</p><p num="0024">An example of the nucleotide sequence of a DNA 
fragment containing the DNA of the present invention
obtained as described above is shown as SEQ ID NO: 1 in
Sequence Listing. The region containing the nucleotide
sequence of the nucleotides 3779 to 5761 in this
nucleotide sequence encodes sucrose PTS enzyme II, which
is the protein of the present invention. In the
nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, the nucleotides 342
to 1505 and the nucleotides 2338 to 3609 correspond to
ORF-F1 and ORF-F2, respectively, in the DNA fragment
containing the sucrase gene described in Japanese Patent
Laid-open Publication (Kokai) No. 8-196280. Further,
when the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and the
nucleotide sequence described in Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publication (Kokai) No. 8-196280 are compared, a
region of the nucleotides 1 to 3687 in the nucleotide
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 was identical to the nucleotide
sequence described in Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publication (Kokai) No. 8-196280. Accordingly, it was
revealed that the DNA fragment containing the sucrase
gene consisted of two independent cloned fragments.</p><p num="0025">The DNA of the present invention may be a DNA that
encodes sucrose PTS enzyme II including substitution,
deletion, insertion, addition or inversion of one or
several amino acids at one or a plurality of sites so
long as the activity for binding to sucrose of the
encoded sucrose PTS enzyme II is not deteriorated. The
number meant by the term "several" used herein may vary 
depending on locations of amino acid residues in the
three-dimensional structure of proteins and kinds of
amino acid residues. This is due to the fact that there
are highly analogous amino acids among amino acids such
as isoleucine and valine, and difference among such
amino acids does not substantially affect the three-dimensional
structure of proteins. Therefore, the
protein may be one having homology of 70% to 80% or
higher, preferably, 90% to 95%, with respect to the
whole amino acid sequence constituting sucrose PTS
enzyme II and having an activity for binding to sucrose.
Specifically, the term "several" means 2 to 180,
preferably 2 to 60, more preferably 2 to 5.</p><p num="0026">Such a DNA encoding a protein which is
substantially identical to sucrose PTS enzyme II as
mentioned above can be obtained by modifying a
nucleotide sequence so that the amino acid sequence at a
particular site should include substitution, deletion,
insertion, addition or inversion of an amino acid
residue or residues through, for example, site-specific
mutagenesis. Further, such a modified DNA as mentioned
above may also be obtained by a conventional mutagenesis
treatment. Examples of the mutagenesis treatment
include an in vitro treatment of DNA encoding sucrose
PTS enzyme II with hydroxylamine or the like, a
treatment of microorganisms such as <i>Escherichia</i> bacteria
containing the DNA encoding sucrose PTS enzyme II by UV 
irradiation or with mutagenesis agents used for a usual
mutagenesis treatment such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
(NTG) and nitrous acid.</p><p num="0027">The aforementioned substitution, deletion,
insertion, addition, inversion or the like of
nucleotides includes naturally occurring mutations
(mutant or variant) such as those observed depending on
differences of strains, species or genera of
microorganisms containing sucrose PTS enzyme II and so
forth.</p><p num="0028">A DNA which encodes a protein substantially the
same as sucrose PTS enzyme II can be obtained by, for
example, isolating a DNA which is hybridizable with a
DNA having the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotides
3779 to 5761 of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1
in Sequence Listing or a probe prepared from DNA having
the nucleotide sequence by PCR or the like under
stringent conditions and encoding a protein containing
sucrose PTS enzyme II having an activity for binding to
sucrose from DNA encoding sucrose PTS enzyme II
containing a mutation or a cell containing it. The
"stringent conditions" referred to herein is a condition
under which a so-called specific hybrid is formed, but a
non-specific hybrid is not formed. It is difficult to
clearly define this condition by using numerical values.
However, for example, the stringent conditions include a
condition under which two of DNAs having high homology, 
for example, two of DNAs having homology of not less
than 50% are hybridized with each other, but two of DNAs
having homology lower than the above level are not
hybridized with each other. Alternatively, the
stringent conditions are exemplified by a hybridization
condition represented by salt concentrations of 1 x SSC,
0.1% SDS, preferably 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 60°C, which
is an ordinary condition of washing in Southern
hybridization. The homology used herein is represented
with a value calculated by the method of Lipman-Pearson
(<i>Science, 227</i>, pp.1435-1441, 1985) or the method of
Takashi &amp; Gotoh (<i>J. Biochem., 92</i>, pp.1173-1177, 1984).
The probe can be designed according to a method known to
those skilled in the art.</p><p num="0029">Those genes hybridizable under the condition as
described above include those having a stop codon
generated in the genes, but such genes can be easily
removed by ligating them to a commercially available
expression vector to examine size of the expressed
product.</p><p num="0030">The protein of the present invention is a protein

amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. The protein of the
present invention may have an amino acid sequence
corresponding to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2
in Sequence Listing including substitution, deletion,
insertion, addition or inversion of one or several amino 
acids so long as it has an activity for binding to
sucrose.</p><p num="0031">The DNA of the present invention can be utilized
to improve sucrose uptake ability of coryneform bacteria
or the like. Further, since PTS consumes PEP for uptake
of a sugar into a cell, PTS is considered to be
disadvantageous for synthesis of amino acids of which
biosynthesis system include PEP in an upstream stage.
Therefore, if sucrose PTS is disrupted and sucrose can
be taken up by an uptake system which does not require
PEP, it is considered advantageous in view of sucrose
uptake rate or productivity of an amino acid or the like.
In coryneform bacteria, non-PTS specific for sucrose is
not known, but, for example, if sucrase is allowed to
act extracellularly, glucose and fructose can be taken
up by non-PTS.</p><p num="0032">Further, if the DNA of the present invention is
modified so as to encode sucrose PTS enzyme II having an
enhanced or suppressed function or so as to be ligated
to an expression control sequence such as a promoter
derived from other genes and introduced into a
coryneform bacterium, a coryneform bacterium having an
enhanced or suppressed sucrose uptake ability can be
created. Specifically, a DNA encoding sucrose PTS
enzyme II having an enhanced function is introduced into
an autonomously replicable vector or chromosomal DNA in
a cell of coryneform bacterium. Further, a DNA encoding 
sucrose PTS enzyme II having a suppressed function is
introduced into chromosomal DNA by gene substitution
utilizing homologous recombination. Alternatively, a
coryneform bacterium in which sucrose PTS functions at
low temperature but does not function at high
temperature can be created by gene substitution using a
plasmid containing a temperature sensitive replication
control region (see Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku)
No. 7-108228).</p><p num="0033">Coryneform bacteria to which the present invention

and microbial cells were collected. 
Chromosomal DNA was extracted from the obtained

detected, and it was revealed that ORF-F2 and ORF-F3
were not adjacent to each other on the chromosome.
Therefore, it was attempted to confirm a sequence

downstream from sucrase gene</heading><p num="0040">To determine the nucleotide sequence of a region
downstream from the sucrase gene, the downstream region
was first amplified by PCR. PCR was performed by using
a TAKARA LA PCR™ in vitro Cloning Kit (Takara Shuzo).
Specifically, the PCR was performed as follows.</p><p num="0041">The chromosomal DNA was completely digested with

produced the same cleavage ends as cassettes (SEQ ID
NOS: 3 to 8 in Sequence Listing) attached to the
aforementioned kit. PCR was performed by using each of
these fragments as a template, Synthetic primer 1 shown
in Table 1 and Cassette primer 1 (SEQ ID NO: 19). Since
a phosphate group was not added to the 5' end of the
cassette, a nick was generated at the ligation site of
the chromosomal DNA fragment and the 5' end of the
cassette. Therefore, the DNA synthesis starting from
the cassette primer stopped at this ligation site, and
only the DNA synthesized from the synthetic primer
served as a template for synthesis starting from the
cassette primer, and a complementary chain was formed.</p><p num="0042">Subsequently, PCR was performed out by using the

Synthetic primer 2 and Cassette primer 2 (SEQ ID NO: 20).
As a result, a fragment could be amplified when a DNA 
obtained by digesting the chromosomal DNA with <i>Eco</i>T14I,
<i>Pst</i>I, <i>Bgl</i>II, <i>Bam</i>HI, <i>Xho</i>I or <i>Ava</i>I was used as a template.
The nucleotide sequence of a fragment of about 1.8 kb
amplified by using the DNA fragment digested with <i>Bam</i>HI
as a template was determined.

primer 4 and Cassette primer 2. As a result, a fragment
could be amplified when a DNA obtained by digesting the
chromosomal DNA with <i>Pst</i>I or <i>Bam</i>HI was used as a
template. The nucleotide sequence of the fragment
amplified based on the DNA fragment digested with <i>Pst</i>I
was determined.</p><p num="0044">Synthetic primers 5 and 6 were synthesized based
