Reactions of this kind are reversible and in competition with one another, so the overall result heavily depends on their respective rates and, when formation of volatile or insoluble products occur, displacement of equilibrium.

Removal of a product, such as ethylene in equation (2), from the system can dramatically alter the course and/or rate of a desired metathesis reaction, since ethylene reacts with an alkylidene complex in order to form a methylene (M=CH<sub>2</sub>) complex, which is the most reactive and also the least stable of the alkylidene complexes.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --><chemistry id="chem0002" num="0002"><img id="ib0002" orientation="unknown" wi="93" img-format="tif" img-content="chem" file="imgb0002.tif" inline="no" he="14"/></chemistry><chemistry id="chem0003" num="0003"><img id="ib0003" orientation="unknown" wi="119" img-format="tif" img-content="chem" file="imgb0003.tif" inline="no" he="10"/></chemistry><chemistry id="chem0004" num="0004"><img id="ib0004" orientation="unknown" wi="93" img-format="tif" img-content="chem" file="imgb0004.tif" inline="no" he="21"/></chemistry><chemistry id="chem0005" num="0005"><img id="ib0005" orientation="unknown" wi="78" img-format="tif" img-content="chem" file="imgb0005.tif" inline="no" he="20"/></chemistry></p><p num="p0005">Of potentially greater interest than homo-coupling (equation 2) is cross-coupling between two different terminal olefins. Coupling reactions involving dienes lead to linear and cyclic dimers, oligomers, and, ultimately, linear or cyclic polymers (equation 3). In general, the latter reaction called acyclic diene metathesis (hereinafter referred to as ADMET) is favoured in highly concentrated solutions or in bulk, while cyclisation is favoured at low concentrations. When intra-molecular coupling of a diene occurs so as to produce a cyclic alkene, the process is called ring-closing metathesis (hereinafter referred to as RCM) (equation 4). Strained cyclic olefins can be opened and oligomerised or polymerised (ring opening metathesis polymerisation (hereinafter referred to as ROMP) shown in equation 5). When the alkylidene catalyst reacts more rapidly with the cyclic olefin (e.g. a norbornene or a cyclobutene) than with a carbon-carbon double bond in the growing polymer chain, then a "living ring opening metathesis polymerisation" may result, i.e. there is little termination during or after the polymerization reaction.</p><p num="p0006">A large number of catalyst systems comprising well-defined single component metal carbene complexes have been prepared and utilized in olefin metathesis. One major development in olefin metathesis was the discovery of the ruthenium and osmium carbene complexes by Grubbs and co-workers. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US5977393A" status="new"><text>U.S.Patent No. 5,977,393</text></patcit> discloses Schiff base derivatives of such compounds, which are useful as olefin metathesis catalysts, wherein the metal is coordinated by a neutral electron donor, such as a triarylphosphine or a tri(cyclo)alkylphosphine, and by an anionic ligand. Such catalysts show an improved thermal stability while maintaining metathesis activity even in polar protic solvents. They are also able to promote cyclisation of, for instance, diallylamine hydrochloride into dihydropyrrole hydrochloride. Remaining problems to be solved with the carbene complexes of Grubbs are (i) improving both catalyst stability (i.e. slowing down decomposition) and metathesis activity at the same time and (ii) broadening the range of organic products achievable by using such catalysts, e.g. providing ability to ring-close highly substituted dienes into tri- and tetra-substituted olefins.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p num="p0007"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9900396A" status="new"><text>International patent application published as WO 99/00396</text></patcit> discloses at least penta-coordinated ruthenium and osmium complexes including two anionic ligands and two monodentate neutral electron donor ligands and further wherein one of the coordinating ligands is a heteroatom-containing alkylidene of the formula = CH - Z - R, wherein Z is sulfur, hydrocarbylphosphino, oxygen or hydrocarbylamino, and wherein R is hydrocarbyl.</p><p num="p0008">International patent application published as <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO03062253A" status="new"><text>WO 03/062253</text></patcit> discloses five-coordinate metal complexes, salt, solvates or enantiomers thereof, comprising a carbene ligand, a multidentate ligand and one or more other ligands, wherein at least one of said other ligands is a constraint steric hindrance ligand having a pKa of at least 15.

According to this specific embodiment, a strong acid (such as a hydrogen halide) may be formed <i>in situ</i> by the reaction of said activating compound, e.g. metal or silicon activating compound, with said further reactant (e.g. a reactant having the formula RYH), and said strong acid if produced in sufficient amount may in turn be able:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>in a first step, to protonate the multidentate Schiff base ligand and decoordinate the nitrogen atom of the imino group of said multidentate Schiff base ligand from the complexed metal, and</li><li>in a second step, to decoordinate the further heteroatom of said multidentate Schiff base ligand from the complexed metal.</li></ul></p><p num="p0027">In this specific embodiment, at least partial cleavage of a bond between the metal and the multidentate Schiff base ligand of said multi-coordinated metal complex occurs like in the absence of the further reactant (e.g. one having the formula RYH), but coordination of the nitrogen atom of the Schiff base ligand to the metal or silicon or other atom having an atomic mass from 27 to 124 of the activating compound occurs less frequently because it competes unfavourably with the protonation/decoordination mechanism resulting from the <i>in situ</i> generation of a strong acid (such as a hydrogen halide). This alternative mechanism is however quite effective in the catalysis of metathesis reactions of organic compounds since it provides a more random distribution of the strong acid formed in the reaction mixture than if the same strong acid is introduced directly in the presence of the multicoordinated metal complex.</p><p num="p0028">The new catalytic species of the invention may be produced extra-temporaneously, separated, purified and conditioned for separate use in organic synthesis reactions later on, or they may be produced <i>in situ</i> during the relevant chemical reaction (e.g. metathesis of unsaturated organic compounds) by introducing a suitable amount of the (e.g. metal or silicon) activating compound into the reaction mixture before, simultaneously with, or alternatively after the introduction of the starting Schiff base metal complex. The present invention also provides catalytic systems including, in addition to<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> said new catalytic species or reaction products, a carrier suitable for supporting said catalytic species or reaction products.</p><p num="p0029">The present invention also provides methods and processes involving the use of such new catalytic species or reaction products, or any mixture of such species, or such catalytic systems, in a wide range of organic synthesis reactions including the metathesis of unsaturated compounds such as olefins and alkynes and certain reactions involving the transfer of an atom or group to an ethylenically or acetylenically unsaturated compound or another reactive substrate, such as atom transfer radical polymerisation, atom transfer radical addition, vinylation, cyclopropanation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds, and the like.

In order for this specific embodiment to provide additional useful effect over the embodiment without said further reactant, especially by forming <i>in situ</i> a strong acid (such as a hydrogen halide) by the reaction of the activating compound with said further reactant (e.g. a reactant having the formula RYH), it is however necessary for the activating compound to include at least one halogen atom.

Since water is also a further reactant according to this embodiment of the invention, it is not necessary for these mono- or polycarboxylic acids, monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, phenols or polyphenols to be used in strictly anhydrous grades but it is admissible to use them in the form of commercial grades including traces of water. Preferably the further reactant has no other functional group that may negatively interact with the hydrogen halide formation process, e.g. by providing the possibility for a competitive reaction with the halogen atom of the activating compound and thus slowing down the rate of the desired hydrogen halide formation. Therefore it may be important to purify a commercial grade of the further reactant when it is known or suspected to contain a significant amount of at least one impurity having such negatively interacting functional group.

These porous materials can be sorted into three broad categories using the details of their microstructure as a basis for classification. These categories are the<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> amorphous and paracrystalline supports, the crystalline molecular sieves and modified layered materials. The detailed differences in the microstructures of these materials manifest themselves in the catalytic and/or sorptive behavior of the materials, as well as in differences in various observable properties used to characterize them, such as their surface area, pore sizes, and pore size distribution, the presence or absence of X-ray diffraction patterns and the details in such patterns, and the appearance of the material microstructure when observed by transmission electron microscopy and/or electron diffraction methods. Amorphous and paracrystalline materials represent an important class of porous inorganic solids that have been used for many years in industrial applications. Typical examples of these materials are the amorphous silicas commonly used in catalyst formulations and the paracrystalline transitional aluminas used as solid acid catalysts and petroleum reforming catalyst supports. The term " amorphous " is used here to indicate a material with no long range order and can be somewhat misleading, since almost all materials are ordered to some degree, at least on the local scale. An alternate term that has been used to describe these materials is "X-ray indifferent". The microstructure of the silicas consists of 100-250 Angstrom particles of dense amorphous silica (<nplcit id="ncit0004" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd. ed., vol. 20, 766-781 (1982)</text></nplcit>), with the porosity resulting from voids between the particles.</p><p num="p0122">Paracrystalline materials such as the transitional aluminas also have a wide distribution of pore sizes, but better defined X-ray diffraction patterns usually consisting of a few broad peaks. The microstructure of these materials consists of tiny crystalline regions of condensed alumina phases and the porosity of the materials results from irregular voids between these regions (K. Wefers and Chanakya Misra, "Oxides and Hydroxides of Aluminum", Technical Paper No 19 Revised, Alcoa Research Laboratories, 54-59 (1987)). Since, in the case of either material, there is no long range order controlling the sizes of pores in the material, the variability in pore size is typically quite high. The sizes of pores in these materials fall into a regime called the mesoporous range, including (for example) pores within the range of about 1.5 to about 20 nm.</p><p num="p0123">In sharp contrast to these structurally ill-defined solids, there are materials whose very narrow pore size distribution is controlled by the precisely repeating crystalline nature of the material's microstructure. These materials are usually called " molecular sieves ", the most important examples of which are zeolites. Zeolites, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X-ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> a number of still smaller channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since their pore dimensions are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials are known as " molecular sieves " and are used in various ways to take advantage of this property. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion-containing crystalline silicates. These silicates can be described as a rigid three-dimensional framework of SiO<sub>4</sub> and a Periodic Table Group IIIB element oxide, e.g., AIO<sub>4</sub>, in which the tetrahedra are crosslinked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total Group IIIB element, e.g., aluminum, and Group IVB element, e.g., silicon, atoms to oxygen atoms is 1:2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing the Group IIIB element, e.g., aluminum, is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of the Group IIIB element, e.g., aluminum, to the number of various cations, such as Ca, Sr, Na, K or Li, is equal to 1. One type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially with another type of cation by using ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to modify the properties of a given silicate by suitable selection of the cation. Many of these zeolites have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolites A (<patcit id="pcit0028" dnum="US2882243A" status="new"><text>U.S. Pat.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of pillared layered materials can vary considerably, depending on the degree that swelling and pillaring disrupt the otherwise usually well-ordered layered microstructure. The regularity of the microstructure in some pillared layered materials is so badly disrupted that only one peak in the low angle region on the X-ray diffraction pattern is observed, at a d-spacing corresponding to the interlayer repeat in the pillared material. Less disrupted materials may show several peaks in this region that are generally orders of this fundamental repeat.

The manner or order of addition of the reactants, catalyst, and solvent are usually not critical, but a few preferred embodiments will be described hereinafter. In particular, the metathesis reaction may be carried out in a liquid reaction medium that contains a solvent for the active catalyst, preferably one in which the reactants, including catalyst, are substantially soluble at the reaction temperature.</p><p num="p0128">In a first embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the metathesis reaction is an olefin metathesis reaction for transforming a first olefin into at least one second olefin or into a linear olefin oligomer or polymer or into a cyclo-olefin. The invention thus relates to<!-- EPO <DP n="52"> --> a method for performing an olefin metathesis reaction comprising contacting at least one first olefin with the catalytic component, optionally supported on a suitable carrier such as decribed hereinabove with reference to one previous aspect of the invention. The high activity of the metal complexes of this invention cause these compounds to coordinate with, and catalyze metathesis reactions between, many types of olefins. Exemplary olefin metathesis reactions enabled by the metal complexes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, RCM of acyclic dienes, cross metathesis reactions, de-polymerization of olefinic polymers and, more preferaby, ROMP of strained cyclic olefins. In particular, the catalytic components of this invention may catalyze ROMP of unsubstituted, monosubstituted and disubstituted strained mono-, bi- and polycyclic olefins with a ring size of at least 3, preferably 3 to 5, atoms; examples thereof include norbornene, cyclobutene, norbornadiene, cyclopentene, dicyclopentadiene, cycloheptene, cyclooctene, 7-oxanorbornene, 7-oxanorbornadiene, cyclooctadiene, cyclododecene, mono- and disubstituted derivatives thereof, especially derivatives wherein the substituent may be C<sub>1-7</sub> alkyl, cyano, diphenylphosphine, trimethylsilyl, methylaminomethyl, carboxylic acid or ester, trifluoromethyl, maleic ester, maleimido and the like, such as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0056" dnum="US6235856B" status="new"><text>U.S. Patent No. 6,235,856</text></patcit>, the content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The invention also contemplates ROMP of mixtures of two or more such monomers in any proportions. Further examples include water-soluble cyclic olefins such as exo-N-(N',N',N'-trimethylammonio)ethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1] hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboximide chloride or exo-N-(N',N',N'-trimethylammonio)ethyl-bicyclo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboximide chloride. As is well known to the skilled person, olefins such as cyclohexenes which have little or no ring strain cannot be polymerized because there is no thermodynamic preference for polymer versus monomer.</p><p num="p0129">A ROMP reaction according to the invention may be carried out in an inert atmosphere for instance by dissolving a catalytic amount of the catalytic component in a suitable solvent and then adding one or more of the said strained cyclic olefins, optionally dissolved in the same or another solvent, to the catalyst solution, preferably under agitation. Because a ROMP system is typically a living polymerisation process, two or more different strained cyclic olefins may be polymerised in subsequent steps for making diblock and triblock copolymers, thus permitting to tailor the properties of the resulting material, provided that the ratio of chain initiation and chain propagation is suitably selected. Solvents that may be used for performing ROMP include all kinds of organic solvents such as protic solvents, polar aprotic solvents and non-polar solvents, as well as supercritical solvents such as carbon dioxide (while performing ROMP under supercritical conditions), which are inert with respect to the strained cyclic olefin and the catalytic<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> component under the polymerization conditions used. More specific examples of suitable organic solvents include, but are not limited to, ethers (e.g. dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol monomethyl or dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl or diethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether or triethylene glycol dimethyl ether), halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane or 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), carboxylic acid esters and lactones (e.g. ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl benzoate, 2-methoxyethyl acetate, γ-butyrolactone, δ-valerolactone or pivalolactone), carboxylic acid amides and lactams (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, tetramethylurea, hexamethyl-phosphoric acid triamide, γ-butyrolactam, ε-caprolactam, N-methylpyrrolidone, N-acetylpyrrolidone or N-methylcaprolactam), sulfoxides (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide), sulfones (e.g. dimethyl sulfone, diethyl sulfone, trimethylene sulfone or tetramethylene sulfone), aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. petroleum ether, pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, toluene or xylene), and nitriles (e.g. acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile or phenylacetonitrile).</p><p num="p0130">The solubility of the polymer formed by ROMP will depend upon the choice of the strained cyclic olefin, the choice of the solvent and the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer obtained. When the strained cyclic olefin is polyunsaturated (e.g. dicyclopentadiene or norbornadiene), the polymer obtained may often be insoluble, whatever the solvent used. Polymerisation temperatures may range from about 0°C to about 120°C, preferably 20°C to 85°C, also depending upon the strained cyclic olefin and the solvent. The duration of polymerisation may be at least about 30 seconds, preferably at least about 1 minute, more preferably at least about 4 minutes, for instance about 30 minutes; the duration of polymerisation may be at most about 24 hours (although longer times may be used at the expense of economic conditions), preferably at most about 4 hours, and more preferably at most about 2 hours. The molar ratio of the strained cyclic olefin to the metal of the catalytic component of the invention is not critical and, depending upon the strained cyclic olefin to be polymerised, the selected temperature and the selected duration of polymerisation, may be at least about 100, preferably at least 250, more preferably at least 500. The said molar ratio is usually, i.e. for most strained cyclic olefins, at most about 5,000,000, preferably at most 500,000 and more preferably at most 200,000 in order to achieve optimal conversion within the above recommended duration of polymerisation. Before the polymer formed solidifies in the reactor or mold or, at will, when a desired molecular weight of the polymer has been achieved (as may be controlled for instance by monitoring reactor temperature and/or reaction mixture viscosity), an oxidation<!-- EPO <DP n="54"> --> inhibitor and/or a terminating or chain-transfer agent may be added to the reaction mixture, if needed. The choice of the terminating or chain-transfer agent used is not critical to this invention, provided that the said terminating agent reacts with the catalytic component and produces another species which is inactive, i.e. not able to further propagate the polymerisation reaction, under the prevailing conditions (e.g. temperature). For instance, adding a molar excess (with respect to the catalytic component) of a carbonyl compound to the reaction mixture is able to produced a metal oxo and an olefin (or polymer) capped with the former carbonyl functionality; the cleaved polymer can then be separated from the catalyst by precipitation with methanol. Another way of cleaving the polymer from the catalyst may be by the addition of a vinylalkylether. Alternatively, reaction with several equivalents of a chain-transfer agent such as a diene is another way of cleaving the polymer chain, which method does not deactivate the catalytic component, permitting additional monomer to be polymerised, however possibly at the risk of broadening molecular weight distribution.</p><p num="p0131">Because the metal complexes of this invention are stable in the presence of various functional groups, they may be used to catalyze metathesis of a wide variety of olefins under a wide variety of process conditions. In particular the olefinic compound to be converted by a metathesis reaction may include one or more, preferably at most two, functional atoms or groups, being for instance selected from the group consisting of ketone, aldehyde, ester (carboxylate), thioester, cyano, cyanato, epoxy, silyl, silyloxy, silanyl, siloxazanyl, boronato, boryl, stannyl, disulfide, carbonate, imine, carboxyl, amine, amide, carboxyl, isocyanate, thioisocyanate, carbodiimide, ether (preferably C<sub>1-20</sub> alkoxy or aryloxy), thioether (preferably C<sub>1-20</sub> thioalkoxy or thioaryloxy), nitro, nitroso, halogen (preferably chloro), ammonium, phosphonate, phosphoryl, phosphino, phosphanyl, C<sub>1-20</sub> alkylsulfanyl, arylsulfanyl, C<sub>1-20</sub> alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, C<sub>1-20</sub> alkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl, sulfonamido and sulfonate (preferably toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate or trifluoromethanesulfonate). The said olefin functional atom or group may be either part of a substituting group of the olefin or part of the carbon chain of the olefin.</p><p num="p0132">The metal complexes of this invention are also useful components for catalyzing, at relatively low temperatures (from about 20°C to 80°C), in the presence or absence of a solvent, the ring-closing metathesis of acyclic dienes such as, for instance, diallylic compounds (diallyl ether, diallyl thioether, diallyl phtalate, diallylamino compounds such as diallylamine, diallylamino phosphonates, diallyl glycine esters), 1,7-octadiene, substituted 1,6-heptadienes and the like.</p><p num="p0133">The metal complexes of this invention may also be used as catalytic components for the preparation of telechelic polymers, i.e. macromolecules with one or more reactive endgroups<!-- EPO <DP n="55"> --> which are useful materials for chain extension processes, block copolymer synthesis, reaction injection moulding, and polymer network formation. An example thereof is hydroxyl-telechelic polybutadiene which may be obtained from 1,5-cycooctadiene, 1,4-diacetoxy-cis-2-butene and vinyl acetate. For most applications, a highly functionalized polymer, i.e. a polymer with at least two functional groups per chain, is required. The reaction scheme for a telechelic polymer synthesis via ring opening metathesis polymerisation is well known to those skilled in the art: in such a scheme, acyclic olefins act as chain-transfer agents in order to regulate the molecular weight of the telechelic polymer produced. When α,ω-bifunctional olefins are used as chain-transfer agents, truly bi-functional telechelic polymers can be synthesized.</p><p num="p0134">According to this aspect of the invention, olefin coupling may be performed by cross-metathesis comprising the step of contacting a first olefinic compound with the above-described catalytically active reaction product in the presence of a second olefin or functionalized olefin. The said first olefinic compound may be a diolefin or a cyclic mono-olefin with a ring size of at least 3 atoms, and the said metathesis cross-coupling is preferably performed under conditions suitable for transforming said cyclic mono-olefin into a linear olefin oligomer or polymer, or said diolefin into a mixture of a cyclic mono-olefin and an aliphatic alpha-olefin.</p><p num="p0135">Depending upon the selection of the starting substrates for the olefin metathesis reaction and the desired organic molecule to be produced, the olefin metathesis reaction can yield a very wide range of end-products including biologically active compounds.

This kind of problem is likely to occur during the molding of thermoset polymers wherein a liquid olefin monomer and a catalytic system are mixed and poured, cast or injected into a mold and wherein on completion of polymerization (i.e. " curing " of the article) the molded part is removed from the mold before any post cure processing that may be required, such as in the Reaction Injection Molding (hereinafter referred as " RIM ") technique. It is well known that the ability to control reaction rates, i.e. the pot life of the reaction mixture, becomes more important in the molding of larger parts using this technique. When using the catalytically active reaction products of this invention, extending the pot life of the reaction mixture and/or controlling the rate of olefin metathesis polymerisation reaction may be effected in different ways, such as increasing the catalyst/olefin ratio and/or adding a polymerization retardant to the reaction mixture and/or selecting a particular mode of introduction of the olefin and the components of the catalytically active reaction product into the reactor (e.g. the mold). For instance, when the catalytically active reaction product of the invention results from modification of the multicoordinated metal complex by an activating metal or silicon compound alone (i.e. in the absence of a further reactant having the general formula RYH), rate control of the polymerisation reaction can be achieved by an improved embodiment comprising:<!-- EPO <DP n="57"> --><ul list-style="bullet"><li>(a) a first step of contacting the optionally supported catalytic component of the invention with the olefin to be polymerised by ring-opening metathesis polymerization in a reactor at a first temperature at which said optionally supported catalytic component is substantially unreactive (inactive), and</li><li>(b) a second heat activation step of bringing the reactor temperature (e.g. heating the contents of said reactor) up to a second temperature above the said first temperature, at which said optionally supported catalytic component is active, until completion of polymerisation.</li></ul></p><p num="p0138">In a more specific version of this improved embodiment, heat activation occurs in bursts rather than continuously, e.g. by repeating the sequence of steps (a) and (b).</p><p num="p0139">Within the said controlled polymerization method, it should be understood that the non-reactivity of the catalytic component in the first step depends not only upon the first temperature but also upon the nature of the olefin(s) used in said molding process (e.g. RIM technique) and/or upon the olefin/catalytic component ratio. Preferably the first temperature is about 20°C but, for specific olefins or specific olefin/catalytic component ratios, it may even be suitable to cool the reaction mixture below room temperature, e.g. down to about 0°C. The second temperature is preferably above 40°C and may be up to about 90°C.</p><p num="p0140">Alternatively, when the catalytically active reaction product of the invention results from modification of the multicoordinated metal complex by an activating metal or silicon compound in the presence of a further reactant (such as an organic acid or having the general formula RYH as decribed hereinabove), premature contact between said activating metal or silicon compound and said further reactant having the general formula RYH may result in premature formation of hydrogen halide which, if gaseous (e.g. hydrogen iodide, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride respectively resulting from a metal or silicon compound including an iodine, bromine or chlorine atom), may escape from the reaction mixture or at least result in unknown concentrations, rate control of the metathesis reaction can be achieved by an improved embodiment wherein the unsaturated compound (e.g. olefin or alkyne) to be submitted to metathesis is distributed in at least two flows before introduction into the reactor, said at least two flows comprising:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>a first flow comprising a first portion of said unsaturated compound in admixture with the multicoordinated metal complex and the reactant having the general formula RYH, and optionally a solvent, and</li><li>a second flow comprising a second portion of said unsaturated compound in admixture with the activating metal or silicon compound, and optionally a solvent.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="58"> --></p><p num="p0141">According to this improved embodiment of the process, the activating metal or silicon compound and the further reactant being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH may be kept separated until entrance into the reactor, thereby preventing premature formation of hydrogen halide. Also, since the multicoordinated metal complex and the reactant being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH are usually non-reactive versus each other, this improved embodiment of the process ensures that all amounts of the activating metal or silicon compound and of the further reactant being an organic acid or having the general formula RYH are available for reaction and, consequently, that all <i>in situ</i> formed hydrogen halide is available for chemical modification of the multicoordinated metal complex.
