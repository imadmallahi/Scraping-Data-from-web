prepared by reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a polyol blend that
includes, a first polyol prepared with a double metal cyanide catalyst and a
second polyol prepared with a basic or acidic catalyst, in the presence of
at least one catalyst and a blowing agent. The present invention also
relates to a process for the preparation of an energy absorbing flexible
foam prepared by reacting an organic isocyanate with a polyol blend that
includes, a first polyol prepared with a double metal cyanide catalyst and a
second polyol prepared with a basic or acidic catalyst, in the presence of
at least one catalyst and a blowing agent. Further, the present invention
relates to uses of flexible foam containing the above-described reaction
product.</p><heading><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0002">Numerous substrates are known in the art for abating energy and
sound produced by appliances and automobiles. Known substrates
include non-woven textile fabrics, such as shoddy pads, and foamed
polyurethane materials. See for example, United States Patent Nos.
4,056,161; 4,966,799; 5,266,143; and 5,068,001. It is also known in the
art to use flexible polyurethane foam as a sound absorbing material. See
United States Patent No. 6,337,356. However, it is not known in the art to
prepare an energy absorbing flexible foam containing an organic
isocyanate, a first polyol prepared with a double metal cyanide ("DMC")
catalyst and a second polyol prepared with a basic catalyst.</p><p num="0003">It is known in the art to use DMC catalysts to produce polyether,
polyester and polyetherester polyols, which are useful in polyurethane
coatings, elastomers, sealants, foams and adhesions. DMC catalysts are
typically obtained by reacting an aqueous solution of a metal salt, such as 
zinc chloride, with an aqueous solution of a metal cyanide salt, such as
potassium hexacyanocobaltate, in the presence of an organic complexing
ligand. The preparation of typical DMC catalysts is described, for example
in United States Patent Nos. 3,427,256, 3,289,505 and 5,158,922. DMC-catalyzed
polyols are typically produced in a batch or semi-batch process,
a high molecular weight polyol starter and DMC catalyst are charged to a
reactor all at once, heated and then reacted with a small amount of
epoxide. After DMC catalyst activation, more epoxide is continuously
added to the reactor to complete polymerization.</p><p num="0004">It is also known in the art to produce molded polyurethane foams
having enhanced physical properties from isocyanate-terminated-prepolymers
prepared from poly(oxy)alkylene polyether polyols having low
unsaturations, as disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,700,847.
Similarly, it is known in the art to prepare polyurethane slab or molded
foam by the reaction of an isocyanate and a DMC catalyzed polyol in the
presence of a catalyst, a chain extender and a surfactant. See United
States Patent No. 6,008,263.</p><p num="0005">Similarly, it is known in the art to produce high resilience (HR) foam
prepared by reacting an isocyanate with a poly(oxypropylene/oxyethylene)
polyol component manufactured at least in part with a DMC catalyst. See
United States Patent No. 5,605,939. HR foams produced in accordance
with United States Patent No. 5,605,939 have resiliency values of greater
than 50%.</p><p num="0006">However, there remains a need in the art to produce an energy
absorbing flexible foam wherein a portion of the polyol prepared with a
basic catalyst can be replaced with a more economical polyol produced
with a DMC catalyst.</p><heading><u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0007">An object of the present invention is to prepare flexible foam
formulations based on DMC catalyzed polyols, which would offer both
value, and performance advantages over conventional foams made with 
basic polyols or otherwise commonly referred to as KOH catalyzed
polyols.</p><p num="0008">Energy absorbing flexible foams are normally prepared with polyols
having a high level of primary OH content. Accordingly, it has presently
been found that flexible open cell foams having good processing
properties can be prepared with DMC catalyzed polyols which contain low
levels of primary OH (&lt;50%). Energy absorbing flexible foams having
acceptable physical properties can be formulated by reacting an organic
polyisocyanate with a first polyol prepared with a DMC catalyst and a
second polyol prepared with a basic or acidic catalyst, in the presence of
at least one catalyst and a blowing agent.</p><p num="0009">The process of preparing polyether polyols with a DMC catalyst is
more cost effective than using a KOH catalyst due to significantly reduced
alkoxylation times. Also, DMC catalysts can generally be used in low
concentrations thereby eliminating the need for the expensive process of
catalyst neutralization.</p><p num="0010">Another advantage of the present invention is that open cell flexible
foams can easily be formulated. Typically, the KOH catalyzed polyols
produce very tight foams, especially when using MDI as the isocyanate.</p><p num="0011">Therefore, the present invention is directed to an energy absorbing
polyurethane foam prepared by reacting an organic isocyanate with a first
polyol prepared with a DMC catalyst and a second polyol which is
prepared with a basic or acidic catalyst in the presence of a blowing agent,
and a catalyst.</p><p num="0012">The present invention is directed to a process for preparing an
energy absorbing flexible polyurethane foam by reacting an organic
polyisocyanate with at least a first and a second polyether polyol in the
presence of a blowing agent, such as water, a catalyst(s) and optionally a
surfactant and other additives. The present invention is also directed to
preparing a flexible foam having energy absorbing properties which is in
part, the reaction product of a first polyol prepared with a DMC catalyst 
and a second polyol prepared with a basic catalyst. Further, the present
invention is directed to a flexible foam prepared by reacting an organic
isocyanate with a first polyol prepared with a DMC catalyst and a second
polyol prepared with a basic catalyst, wherein the first polyether polyol
contains from about 20% to about 80% by weight of the total polyol blend</p><heading><u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p num="0013">The polyurethane foam prepared in accordance with the present
invention can be processed at a wide range of isocyanate/polyol
equivalent ratios (index). Preferably, the foam of the present invention is
prepared with an NCO index in the range of 65 to 105, more preferably,
with an NCO index in the range of 75 to 95.</p><p num="0014">The process to prepare the foam of the present invention provides
for preparing a polyol blend. Generally, the polyol blend of the present
invention includes at least a first and a second polyol, wherein the first
polyol is prepared with a DMC catalyst and the second polyol is prepared
with a basic catalyst. The first polyol is present in the range of about 20 to
about 80 weight percent of the total polyol blend, preferably 25 to about 65
weight percent. The second polyol is present in the range of about 12 to
about 78 weight percent, preferably in the range of about 29 to about 72
weight percent. The polyol blend may also comprise a catalyst(s) in the
range of about 0.4 to about 2 weight percent, preferably about 0.6 to about
1.5 weight percent. The polyol blend may also contain a blowing agent in
an amount in the range of about 1.0 to about 15 weight percent, preferably
about 2.0 to about 4.5 weight percent. Optionally, the polyol blend of the
present invention may contain a surfactant in an amount in the range of
about 0.1 to about 3.0 weight percent, preferably about 0.3 to about 2.0
weight percent. Optionally, the polyol blend may contain auxiliaries or
fillers in an amount in the range of about 0 to about 25 weight percent,
preferably about 0 to about 15 weight percent.</p><p num="0015">Suitable starting polyisocyanate components for use in the present
invention include aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic and 
heterocyclic polyisocyanates of the type described, for example, by W.
Siefken in Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, 562, pages 72 to 136.

and 848,671 may also be used in the present invention; m- and p-isocyanato-phenylsulfonyl
isocyanates according to U.S. Patent No.
3,454,606; perchlorinated aryl polyisocyanates of the type described, for
example, in German Auslegeschrift No. 1,157,601 (U.S. Patent No.

example, in British Patent No. 993,890, in Belgian Patent No. 761,626 and
in published Dutch Patent Application No. 7,102,524 are still further
examples of suitable isocyanates. Additionally, polyisocyanates
containing isocyanurate groups of the type described, for example, in U.S.
Patent No. 3,001,973; in German Offenlegungsschriften Nos. 1,929,034
and 2,004,408; polyisocyanates containing urethane groups of the type

Patent No. 1,101,394 (U.S. Patent Nos. 3,124,605 and 3,201,372) and in
British Patent No. 889,050 are also suitable.</p><p num="0016">Aromatic polyisocyanates, which are liquid at the processing
temperature, are preferably used. Preferred are diphenylmethane
diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate. More preferably, the aromatic
polyisocyanates used with the present invention are in the MDI family of
isocyanates. Examples of more preferred isocyanates include liquid
blends of 2-4' and/or 4-4' isocyanato, diphenylmethane with polyphenyl
polymethylene polyisocyanates including derivatives and prepolymers of
these isocyanate blends.</p><p num="0017">Suitable as the first polyol are polyether polyols prepared with a
DMC catalyst. DMC catalysts are well known in the art. Suitable DMC
catalysts and methods for preparing them are disclosed in, for example,
United States Patent Nos. 3,427,256, 3,427,335, 3,829,505, 4,477,589,
5,158,922, 5,470,813, 6,204,357, and 6,323,375, the teachings of which
are incorporated herein by reference. The first polyol can be prepared by
methods known in the art. For example, a heterocyclic monomer, such as
an epoxide, reacts with an active hydrogen containing initiator. Illustrative
examples of how to prepare a polyol with a DMC catalysts are disclosed in
United States Patent Nos. 3,829,505, 3,941,849, 4,355,188 and
4,472,560, the teachings of which are incorporated by reference.</p><p num="0018">Generally, the polyols useful as the first polyol of the present
invention are produced by polyaddition of alkylene oxides to starter
compounds containing active hydrogen atoms. The oxyalkylation of the
starter compound is conducted with one or more higher alkylene oxides,
such as propylene oxide and butylene oxide. Use of mixtures of ethylene
oxide and one or more higher alkylene oxides leads to essentially random 
copolymers. The ratio of higher alkylene oxide to ethylene oxide may be
changed during oxyalkylation to produce multiple block polyols containing
blocks of all higher alkylene oxide derived moieties and/or one or more
block of higher alkylene oxide/ethylene oxide moieties. Polymerization
solely with ethylene oxide should be avoided when employing DMC
catalyst. Further details are given in "Ullmanns Encyclopadie der
industriellen Chemie", English-language Edition 1992, Vol. A21, pp. 670-671.
As starter compounds containing active hydrogen atoms,
compounds are used with molecular weights of 18 to 2000 and with 1 to 8
hydroxyl groups. Examples of useful starter compounds include ethylene
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol,
hexamethylene glycol, bisphenol A, trimethylolpropane,
glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, cane sugar, degraded starch and water.</p><p num="0019">Preferred polyols include, for example, poly(oxy-propylene)polyols,
mixed EO/PO polyols, butylene oxide polymers, butylene oxide polymers,
butylene oxide co-polymers with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide,
and-poly(oxytetra-methylene) glycols.</p><p num="0020">The first polyol preferably has an average functionality from 1.9 to
3.0, more preferably, around 2. The first polyol preferably has a hydroxyl
number within the range of about 16 to about 112, more preferably, from
about 28 to about 56. The first polyol generally has a number average
molecular weight with in the range of about 1,000 to about 8,000, more
preferably, from about 2,000 to about 4,800. Preferably, polyols useful as
the first polyol of the present invention have a primary OH content from
about 0 to about 50%.</p><p num="0021">The second polyol is any polyol prepared by basic catalysts or
acidic. The high molecular weight polyethers suitable for use in
accordance with the invention are known and may be obtained, for
example, by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran or epoxides such as, for
example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide or
epichlorohydrin in the presence of suitable catalysts, such as, for example, 
BF<sub>3</sub> or KOH, or by chemically adding these epoxides, preferably ethylene
oxide and propylene oxide, in admixture or successively to starter
compounds containing reactive hydrogen atoms such as water, alcohols,
diols, triols, etc. Examples of suitable starter compounds include, for
example, propylene glycol, glycerin, ethylene glycol, triethanolamine,
water, trimethylol-propane, sorbitol, pentaerythritol, bisphenol A, sucrose,
ethanolamine, etc., and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0022">Mixtures of amine started polyether polyols with hydroxyl started
polyether polyols are also suitable as the second polyol in the present
invention. If these are used, it is preferred that these are mixtures with trifunctional
polyether polyols as described above.</p><p num="0023">In addition, polyether polyols, which contain high molecular weight
polyadducts or polycondensates in finely dispersed form or in solution,
may be used. Such modified polyether polyols are obtained when
polyaddition reactions (e.g., reactions between polyisocyanates and amino
functional compounds) or polycondensation reactions (e.g., between
formaldehyde and phenols and/or amines) are directly carried out in situ in
the polyether polyols. Polyethers modified by vinyl polymers, of the type
formed, for example, by polymerizing styrene or acrylonitrile in the
presence of polyether (U.S. Patents 3,383,351; 3,304,273; 3,523,093; and
3,110,695; and German Patent 1,152,536), are also suitable, as are
polybutadienes containing OH groups.</p><p num="0024">The second polyol preferably has an average functionality from 1.5
to 6.0, more preferably, from 2.5 to 4.0. The second polyol preferably has
a hydroxyl number within the range of about 16 to about 112, more
preferably, from about 28 to about 56. The second polyol generally has a
number average molecular weight with in the range of about 1,000 to
about 10,000, more preferably, from about 2,000 to about 6,000.
Preferably, polyether polyols useful as the second polyol of the present
invention have a primary OH content of greater than 50%, preferably
greater than 70%. </p><p num="0025">The polyol blend used in the present invention should also include a
catalyst. Suitable catalysts include, for example, various organic metal
compounds, including, for example, tin(II) salts of carboxylic acids, dialkyl
tin salts of carboxylic acids, dialkyl tin mercaptides, dialkyl tin dithioesters
and tertiary amines and their acid salts which are useful as delayed action
catalysts. Such acids include formic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, glycolic
acid and acetic acid. Examples of suitable amine catalysts include
dimethylcyclohexylamine (e.g. Polycat 8), pentamethyldiethylenetriamine
(i.e. Polycat 5), bis[2 (dimethylamino)ethyl]ether (e.g. Niax A-1), dimethylethanolamine
(i.e. DMEA), and triethylene diamine (e.g. Dabco 33LV), etc.
Of course, it is also possible to use any of the catalysts, which are well
known to those skilled in the art of polyurethane chemistry.</p><p num="0026">The blowing agent can be any blowing agent that accomplishes the
objects of the present invention. Suitable blowing agents include liquid
CO<sub>2</sub> and environmentally acceptable chlorofluorocarbons, highly
fluorinated and/or perfluorinated hydrocarbons, and any other suitable
physical-blowing agent known in polyurethane chemistry. If the blowing
agent is a physical blowing agent it is generally used in an amount from
about 3.0 to 10.0 parts per 100 parts of the polyol blend. If the blowing
agent is CO<sub>2</sub> it is generally used in an amount from about 1.0 to 3.0 parts
per 100 parts of the polyol blend. Preferably, the blowing agent is water
and is used in an amount from about 1.0 to 6.0 parts, more preferably from
about 2.0 to about 4.5 parts, per 100 parts of the polyol blend.</p><p num="0027">Optionally, any surfactants known in the art can be used in the
present invention. Surfactants that can be used in the present invention
include polyether siloxanes. The structure of these compounds is
generally such that a copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide is
attached to a polydimethyl siloxane radical. Such foam stabilizers are
described in, for example, United States Patent No. 2,764,565.</p><p num="0028">Preferably, silicon surfactants suitable for flexible polyurethane
foams are used in the present invention. Surfactants can be used in the 
present invention in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0% by weight,
based on the total weight of the polyol blend. B 4113 LF and B 8715 LF,
which are available commercially from Goldschmidt AG and E-9924 which
is available from Bayer AG are examples of surfactants which can be used
in the present invention.</p><p num="0029">If desired, further auxiliaries and/or additive can be incorporated
into the reaction mixture for producing the energy absorbing flexible foams
of the present invention. Suitable auxiliaries or additives include surface-active
substances, foam stabilizers, cell regulators, cell openers, fillers,
dyes, pigments, flame retardants, hydrolysis inhibitors, fungistatic and
bacteriostatic substances and adhesion promoters.</p><p num="0030">According to the present invention, the components may be reacted
together by known processes often using mechanical devices. Details
concerning processing apparatus which may be used according to the
present invention may be found in Kunststoff-Handbuch, Colume VII,
published by Vieweg and Hochtlen, Carl-Hanser-Verlag, Munich, 1966,
pages 121-205.</p><p num="0031">The foaming reaction for producing foam products can be carried
out inside molds. In this process, the foamable reaction mixture is
introduced into a mold, which may be made of metal such as aluminum or
a plastic material such as an epoxide resin. According to the present
invention, the desired result can be obtained by introducing a 10% excess
(overpack) over the amount just required to fill the mold after the reaction
is complete.</p><p num="0032">The invention is further illustrated but is not intended to be limited

Foam machine as ½ " pads and 2-inch blocks. A water-heated aluminum
mold which measured 10" x 10" x 2.5" was first treated with Chem Trend
1189C, a solvent based wax external mold release agent, and then heated
to 60°C. Using a Hennecke HK-250 high-pressure foam machine
equipped with Rexroth pumps and an MQ-12 mixhead, the reaction
mixture was open-poured into the preheated mold. The polyol blend was
preheated to 35°C and the isocyanate component was also preheated to
35°C. All foams were prepared using a throughput of 180 g/sec. A shot
time for a 3.0 pcf foam was 1.056 sec. An isocyanate pressure of 1900 psi
and a polyol pressure of 1800 psi were used. Foams, submitted for
physical properties, were all demolded in 100 seconds. Upon demold, the
foams were manually crushed to open the cells and avoid shrinkage.</p><p num="0035">The catalyst ratio was adjusted so that the ½" thick pads would be
stable towards shrinkage. The 10×10×2.5 inch foam blocks were
produced at three different indices (75, 85 and 95) per formulation and
submitted for physical properties and compared to the Bayfit SA 511
system. As illustrated below Example 1 had the best compression set
values and Example 3 had the best overall physical properties. <tables><table><tgroup cols="4"><tbody><row><entry nameend="4" namest="1">Sound Absorbinq Foam</entry></row><row><entry
