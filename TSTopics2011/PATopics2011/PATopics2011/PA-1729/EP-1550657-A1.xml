a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, or a prodrug
thereof, in particular, an amine compound having anti-virus
activity based on antagonism to chemokine receptor CXCR4.
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a
pharmaceutical drug for associated diseases such as
rheumatic diseases and cancer metastatic diseases, based on
antagonism against a chemokine receptor CXCR4.</p><heading><u style="single">Background Art</u></heading><p num="0002">While examples of therapeutic drugs against the
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by an
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
include a reverse transcriptase inhibitor and a protease
inhibitor, therapeutic effectiveness of those drugs has been
lost due to the emergence of drug resistant HIV mutants (see,
for example, Saishin Igaku, Vol. 53, No. 9, p. 2031 (1998)).
Also, the polypharmacy using the combination of such drugs
has such disadvantages that it requires many conditions to
be observed in administration, that it is complex, that it
needs many kinds of drugs to be administered, and that it
causes various side effects (see, for example, Nikkei
Science, Oct., p. 29 (1998)). Moreover, particularly in
case of using the protease inhibitor, it is known that the 
probability of causing emergence and screening of the
resistant strain will increase unless the administration of
approximately 100% of the drugs is kept, in spite of the
complex administration method and many side effects thereof
(see, for example, Molecular Medicine, Vol. 36, No. 9, p.
1012 (1999)).</p><p num="0003">Alternatively, development of vaccine has been
attempted because many viral diseases were destroyed or
remarkably weakened by vaccines in the past. However, this
is considered to be extremely difficult since mutations are
occurred frequently in HIV (see, for example, Nikkei Science,
Oct., p. 42 (1998)).</p><p num="0004">Although several kinds of compounds having an anti-HIV
effect have been reported as described above,
it is now strongly desired to develop a novel antiviral drug
which has excellent anti-retrovirus effect, is capable of
opposing to the expression of the resistance, and which has
little toxicity and causes little side effect, thereby
allowing long term administration.</p><p num="0005">Chemokines is one kind of cytokine which renders
chemotaxis to leukocytes, and is a secretory protein.
Chemokine is classified into CXC-chemokine, CC-chemokine, C-chemokine,
CX3C-chemokine according to the cysteine (Cys)
sequence at N-terminal, and the total number thereof is said
to be about 30. The chemokine receptor includes several sub
types. Among them, it is known that the CXCR4 which is a
ligand for CXC-chemokine SDF-1 is utilized as a coreceptor
on infection to a host cell of T cell-directive HIV (see, 
for example, Science, 272, 872 (1996) and Nature, 382, 829
(1996) 6). The HIV invades through binding to the CXCR4 on
the surface of a host cell of an envelope protein gp120.
That is, the drug having antagonism against the CXCR4 is
expected as an anti-HIV drug based on a novel mechanism of
invasion inhibition, and there have been reported three low
molecular compounds as such drugs: AMD3100 (see, for example,
J. Exp. Med, 186, 1383 (1997), T22 (see, for example, J. Exp.
Med, 186, 1389 (1997)), and ALX40-4C (see, for example, J.
Exp. Med, 186, 1395 (1997)).</p><p num="0006">On the other hand, it has been elucidated that the
CXCR4 associates with various diseases besides HIV infection.
For example, there has been reported its association with
rheumatic disease (see, for example, WO 00/06086), cancer
metastatic disease (see, for example, Nature, 410, 50
(2001)), etc.</p><p num="0007">As a therapeutic drug for such diseases, it is
strongly desired to develop a novel low-molecular drug which
has CXCR4 antagonism, and which has little toxicity and
causes little side effect, thereby allowing long term
administration.</p><heading><u style="single">Disclosure of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a
drug and a prodrug thereof having an excellent anti-retrovirus
effect, and also a novel chemical structure

high safety.</p><p num="0009">As a result of studies to develop a compound 
having an excellent anti-retrovirus effect, and also having
a novel chemical structure useful as an excellent CXCR4
antagonist against SDF-1<sub>"</sub>, the present inventors have found
a group of amine compounds which exhibit protection
characteristics in a cell vaccinated with HIV-1 and
therefore are regarded as having a potentiality for
treatments of AIDS, AIDS-associated complication, and the
like, and which also exhibit a powerful CXCR4 antagonism and
therefore are regarded as having a potentiality for
treatments of rheumatic disease, cancer metastatic diseases,
and the like. Thus, another object of the present invention
is to provide a compound represented by the general formula
(1) defined below, which has an anti-virus activity for
mainly HIV and a CXCR4 antagonism, and still another object
of the invention is to provide a drug comprising the
