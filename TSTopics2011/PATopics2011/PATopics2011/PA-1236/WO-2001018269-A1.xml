num="p0003">This invention relates to the recovery of copper from copper bearing sulphide minerals</p><p num="p0004">Commercial bioleach plants which are currently in operation treating sulphide minerals, typically operate within the temperature range of 40°C to 50°C and rely on sparging air to the bioleach reactors to provide the required oxygen Operation at this relatively low temperature and the use of air to supply oxygen, limit the rate of sulphide mineral oxidation that can be achieved For example carrolite and enargite are relatively slow leaching at temperatures below 50°C and treatment at or below this temperature would result in poor and sub-economic metal extraction</p><p num="p0005">The use of high temperatures between 50°C and 100°C greatly increases the rate of sulphide mineral leaching</p><p num="p0006">The solubility of oxygen is however limited at high temperatures and the rate of sulphide mineral leaching becomes limited In the case of using air for the supply of oxygen, the effect of limited oxygen solubility is such that the rate of sulphide mineral leaching becomes dependent on and is limited by the rate of oxygen transfer from the gas to the liquid phase <sup>(1 2)</sup></p><p num="p0007">The bioleaching of secondary copper bearing sulphide minerals is similarly problematic and to the applicant's knowledge no commercial copper bioleach plants are in operation</p><p num="p0008">More particularly chaicopyπte has long been known to be generally refractory to bioleaching using mesophiles A major challenge is the leaching of chaicopyπte

 The invention further extends to a plant for recovering copper from a copper bearing sulphide mineral slurry which includes a reactor vessel a source which feeds a copper bearing sulphide mineral slurry to the vessel, an oxygen source a device which measures the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry in the vessel, a control mechanism whereby in response to the said measure of dissolved oxygen concentration, the supply of oxygen from the oxygen source to the slurry is controlled to achieve a dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry within a predetermined range and a recovery system which recovers copper from a bioleach residue from the reactor vessel</p><p num="p0048">The oxygen may be supplied in the form of oxygen enπched gas or substantially pure oxygen</p><p num="p0049">The reactor vessel may be operated at a temperature in excess of 60°C and preferably in the range of 60°C to 85°C</p><p num="p0050">The plant may include a pre-leachmg stage for leaching the copper bearing sulphide mineral slurry before the slurry is fed to the reactor vessel In the pre-leachmg stage use may be made of an acidic solution of copper and feme sulphate</p><p num="p0051">Various techniques may be used for controlling the supply of oxygen to the slurry and hence for controlling the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry at a desired value Use may for example be made of valves which are operated manually For more accurate control use may be made of an automatic control system These techniques are known in the art and are not further described herein</p><p num="p0052">As has been indicated oxygen and carbon dioxide may be added to the slurry in accordance with predetermined cπteπa Although the addition of these materials may be based on expected demand and measurement of other performance parameters, such as ιron(ll) concentration it is preferred to make use of suitable measurement probes to sample the actual values of the critical parameters</p><p num="p0053">For example use may be made of a dissolved oxygen probe to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry directly To achieve this the probe is immersed in the slurry The dissolved oxygen

 concentration may be measured indirectly by using a probe in the reactor off-gas or by transmitting a sample of the off-gas, at regular intervals, to an oxygen gas analyser Again it is pointed out that measuring techniques of this type are known in the art and accordingly any appropriate technique can be used</p><p num="p0054">A preferred approach to the control aspect is to utilise one or more probes to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry, whether directly or indirectly The probes produce one or more control signals which are used to control the operation of a suitable valve or valves, eg solenoid valves, automatically so that the supply of oxygen to an air stream which is being fed to the slurry is varied automatically in accordance with real time measurements of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry</p><p num="p0055">Although it is preferred to control the addition of oxygen to a gas stream which is fed to the slurry a reverse approach may be adopted in that the oxygen supply rate to the reactor vessel may be maintained substantially constant and the rate of supply of the sulphide mineral slurry to the reactor vessel may be vaπed to achieve a desired dissolved oxygen concentration</p><p num="p0056">The invention is not limited to the actual control technique employed and is intended to extend to vaπations of the aforegoing approaches and to any equivalent process</p><p num="p0057">The method of invention is of particular benefit to chaicopyπte concentrates, which are more-or-less refractory to leaching at mesophile operating temperatures The method of the invention therefore opens the door to commercial thermophile leaching of chalcopyπte which to the applicant's knowledge was previously not possible The added benefits of a high specific reactor sulphide oxidation duty and reduced specific power requirement for oxidation, while still advantageous, are of less significance in this instance</p><p num="p0058">Additionally copper bearing sulphide flotation concentrates frequently contain chalcocite and the method of the invention is of particular benefit, because chalcocite has a high leaching rate, even at typical mesophile operating temperatures, which is further increased at the higher temperatures used with moderate and extreme thermophiles Thus the benefits of the invention including a high specific reactor sulphide oxidation duty and reduced specific power requirement for oxidation will be particularly beneficial duπng the

bioleaching of copper beanng sulphide concentrates containing chalcocite, even at typical mesophile operating temperatures</p><p num="p0059">Copper may be recovered from solution by any appropriate process, for example solvent extraction followed by electrowinnmg, iron precipitation or by resin-m-pulp applied to the slurry, followed by electrowinnmg</p><p num="p0060">If electrowinnmg is selected as the production method for copper, the oxygen generated at the anode in the electrowinnmg process may be used to supplement that used in the bioleach process, reducing the capital and operating costs required for oxygen production</p><p num="p0061">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p><p num="p0062">The invention is further described by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a portion of a plant in which the invention is earned out, Figures 2, 3 and 4 shows vaπous results and parameters obtained from operating a bioreactor in the manner described herein with reference to Figure 1 , and</p><p num="p0063">Figures 5 and 6 are process flow charts of copper recovery processes according to different forms of the invention</p><p num="p0064">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</p><p num="p0065">General Principles</p><p num="p0066">The limitation of low oxygen solubility duπng bioleaching, using air, at high temperatures, which in turn limits the rate of reaction, requires enrichment of the air with oxygen iβ air with an oxygen content greater than 21% by volume, or the use of pure oxygen (defined as being greater than 85% oxygen by volume) The use of oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen overcomes the limited rate of reaction due to oxygen supply constraints, but has two major disadvantages 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->

 The air flow rate from the source 36 to the sparger 44 is controlled by means of the valve 42. Normally the valve is set to provide a more or less constant flow of air from the source 36 to the sparger and the additions of oxygen and carbon dioxide to the air stream are controlled by the valves 38 and 40 respectively. Although this is a preferred approach to adjusting the oxygen and carbon dioxide contents in the air flow to the sparger other techniques can be adopted. For example it is possible, although with a lower degree of preference, to adjust the air stream flow rate and to mix the adjustable air stream with a steady supply of oxygen and a variable supply of carbon dioxide, or vice versa. Another possibility is to have two separate air stream flows to which are added oxygen and carbon dioxide respectively.
