load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><p>Provided is an ink-jet ink suitable for high
speed printing and reduced ink ejection amount, which
ink comprise a water-insoluble coloring material
dispersed in water with a resinous dispersant,
glycerin, ethylene urea, and polyoxyethylene alkyl
ether with HLB not lower than 13.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading>Field of the Invention</heading><p num="0001">The present invention relates to a pigment ink
for ink jet recording systems, especially suitable
for the thermal type ink jet recording system, which
will provide ink discharge stability and durability
to the recording head. The present invention also
relates to an ink cartridge, recording unit, an ink
jet recording method using them, an ink jet recording
apparatus and a method for stabilizing the ink
discharge.</p><heading>Related Background Art</heading><p num="0002">The ink jet recording method is a method of
recording by applying energy to ink to fly an ink
droplet from a nozzle to deposit the ink onto a
recording medium such as paper.</p><p num="0003">Recently the size of an ink droplet discharged
from a single nozzle has become smaller and smaller
in order to meet the need for the ink jet recorded
image of extremely high quality comparable to that of
silver halide photography, and now ink jet printers
that eject an ink droplet of not larger than about 10
pl (picoliter) are commercially available. Also with 
increasing demand for higher printing speed, it is
urgently required to cope with higher drive frequency
(for example 5 kHz or higher, preferably 10 kHz or
higher).</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0004">Recently, not only preciseness but also
fastness such as light fastness are required for the
ink jet recorded image. Thus, use of water-insoluble
coloring materials such as pigments has started.
However, it is still insufficient the study of
application of ink containing a water-insoluble
coloring material in the high-speed ink jet recording
system to obtain precise images.</p><p num="0005">Under such situation, the present inventors
have been studying the possibility of high-speed
thermal ink jet recording of highly precise image
with ink containing water-insoluble pigment dispersed
in an aqueous medium with a resinous dispersant. In
the course of such investigation, they found that
such an ink may not fail to keep up with increasing
drive frequency of the thermal ink jet head, thereby
causing unstable ink discharge. As a result of
further investigation based on such finding, the
present inventors considered that, when such an ink
was heated by the heater of the thermal ink jet head,
the pigment and the resinous dispersant physically 
adsorbing to the pigment separated temporarily to
lose dispersion stability, which would cause ink
discharge instability. In case of low drive
frequencies, even if the dispersion state is
disrupted temporarily, the stability of dispersion is
restored for example by re-adsorption of the resinous
dispersant to the pigment, but with higher drive
frequencies, the restoration of the dispersion
stability is insufficient resulting in instability of
ink discharge. Thus, to meet the aforementioned
requirements based on the future technical trend, the
present inventors have done intensive study to obtain
an ink for ink jet printer, particularly for thermal
ink jet recording, that can form an image of higher
preciseness at a higher recording speed while
maintaining the basic properties required for the ink
jet recording ink such as the start-up property
(discharge ability of the ink from a nozzle after
temporarily suspension of discharge) and the clogging
resistance in the nozzle. As a result, they have
found that ink of a particular composition can
achieve aforementioned objects, thereby the present
invention was made.</p><p num="0006">An object of the present invention is to
provide an ink jet ink containing a water-insoluble
coloring material dispersed in water with a resinous
dispersant that can cope with further increase in the 
recording speed and further decrease in the droplet
size.</p><p num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to
provide an ink jet recording method capable of
forming a high quality image at a high speed and in
stable manner.</p><p num="0008">Still another object of the present invention
is to provide an ink cartridge, a recording unit and
an ink jet recording apparatus applicable to the
above-mentioned ink jet recording method.</p><p num="0009">Still another object of the present invention
is to provide a method for stabilizing ink discharge
from a thermal ink jet recording head when the liquid
droplet size is reduced and/or the drive frequency is
increased.</p><p num="0010">According to an embodiment of the present
invention, there is provided an ink jet ink
comprising water, a water-insoluble coloring material,
a resinous dispersant for dispersing said water-insoluble
coloring material into water, glycerin,
ethylene urea, and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether having
HLB of 13 or more.</p><p num="0011">According to another embodiment of the present
invention, there is provided an ink cartridge
comprising an ink container which contains the
aforementioned ink.</p><p num="0012">According to another embodiment of the present 
invention, there is provided a recording unit
comprising an ink container which contains the
aforementioned ink, and an ink jet head for
discharging the ink.</p><p num="0013">According to another aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an ink jet recording
method comprising a step of discharging the
aforementioned ink from an ink jet recording head.</p><p num="0014">According to another embodiment of the present
invention, there is provided an ink jet recording
apparatus comprising an ink container which contains
the aforementioned ink, and an ink jet recording head
for discharging the ink.</p><p num="0015">According to still another embodiment of the
present invention, there is provided a method for
stabilizing ink discharge from an ink jet recording
head when the ink jet recording head is driven at a
frequency of not less than 5kHz, the ink jet
recording head's ink discharge amount per discharge
operation being not more than 20pl, comprising the
step of utilizing an ink of claim 7 for discharging
with the ink jet recording head.</p><p num="0016">The reason why such a configuration can
stabilize ink discharge in thermal ink jet recording
even at high drive frequencies is not yet clarified,
but it is presumed that polyoxyethylene alkyl ether
of HLB not lower than 13, glycerin and ethylene urea 
function synergistically to rapidly restore the
dispersion state of the ink temporally disturbed on
the heater surface.</p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p num="0017"><sl><li>Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view showing

employed in the present invention can be, for example,
an organic pigment or an inorganic pigment.</p><p num="0022">As the pigment for black ink, for example,
carbon black can be used advantageously. Examples of
carbon black include furnace black, lamp black,
acetylene black and channel black. Within such

include C.I. pigment yellow 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 24,
55, 74, 83, 86, 93, 97, 98, 109, 110, 117, 120, 125,

of the water-insoluble coloring material to the
entire weight of the ink may vary according to the
intended coloring ability of the ink and the intended
color hue to be reproduced on the recording medium,
and also the quality of the ink jet image to be
formed. Thus, it is not particularly limited as long
as the practical physical properties as an ink jet
ink can be maintained. In general, the upper limit
is about 10 % of the total weight of the ink. The
present invention is also applicable to so-called
pale ink containing a coloring material at a
concentration of about 0.1 to 0.5% in the ink. Such
pale ink has low coloring ability and often is 
employed for forming an ink jet image of silverhalide
photographic quality. The present invention
is, however, more effective with ink containing a
coloring material at a high concentration, since the
aforementioned disturbance of dispersion stability of
the coloring material in the ink, which occurs in the
vicinity of the heater during the thermal ink jet
recording, tends to occur as the coloring material
concentration increases.</p><heading>(iii) Resinous dispersant</heading><p num="0026">Any water-soluble resin known as a dispersant
can be used as the resinous dispersant as long as it
is comprised of a hydrophobic portion having an
affinity to the water-insoluble coloring material and
a hydrophilic portion having an affinity to water.
Examples of such resinous dispersant include block
copolymers, random copolymers, graft copolymers and
salts thereof made with two or more kinds of monomers
(at least one is a hydrophilic monomer) selected from
styrene, styrene derivatives, vinylnaphthalene, and
derivatives thereof, aliphatic alcohol esters of α,
β-ethylenic unsaturated carboxylic acids, acrylic
acid and derivatives thereof, maleic acid and
derivatives thereof, itaconic acid and derivatives
thereof, fumaric acid and derivatives thereof, vinyl
acetate, vinylpyrrolidone, acryl amide and
derivatives thereof. Among these, block copolymer is 
particularly preferred for the present invention.</p><p num="0027">Needless to say, it is preferable that ink
discharge is not at all or hardly affected by the
resinous dispersant present in the ink in an amount
required for dispersing the water-insoluble coloring
material or more, in view of stabilization of ink
discharge under high frequency drive, which is one of
the objectives of the present invention. Among the
aforementioned resinous dispersants, a substance
having a block structure, namely a block copolymer,
is particularly preferred for such an objective.</p><p num="0028">The block copolymer can be represented by, for
example, AB, BAB, ABC etc., where A, B and C
represent polymer blocks of different structures
respectively. Block copolymers comprised of a
hydrophobic block and a hydrophilic block of which
block size is well balanced in contributing to the
dispersion stability are particularly useful for the
present invention. Also the hydrophobic block to
which the coloring material ant binds may contain a
functional group to enhance the specific interaction
between the dispersant and the coloring material
thereby further improving the dispersion stability.
Due to its rheological properties, such a polymer is
especially preferably used in an ink jet recording
head utilizing thermal energy, particularly, in an
ink jet recording head ejecting minute ink droplets, 
more specifically, in an amount of 20 pl or less,
more specifically within a range of 0.1 to 20 pl,
particularly 0.1 to 15 pl and more particularly 0.1
to 10 pl per one ejection operation. The amount of
the polymer in the ink is variable depending on the
structure, molecular weight and other properties of
such polymer and other components of the ink
composition. The weight-average molecular weight of
the polymer selected in exercising the present
invention is less than 30,000, preferably less than
20,000 and more preferably within a range of 2,000 to
10,000.</p><p num="0029">Methods for producing such polymers are
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Applications Laidopen
Nos. 05-179183, 06-136311, 07-053841, 10-87768,
11-043639, 11-236502 and 11-269418.</p><p num="0030">Representative examples of the hydrophobic
monomer employable in the block copolymer include,
but are not limited to, benzyl acrylate, benzyl
methacrylate, methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethyl
methacrylate (EMA), propyl methacrylate, n-butyl
methacrylate (BMA or NBMA), hexyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl
methacrylate (EHMA), octyl methacrylate,
lauryl methacrylate (LMA), stearyl methacrylate,
phenyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA),
hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 2-ethoxyethyl

hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate,
acrylonitrile, 2-trimethylsiloxyethyl acrylate,
glycidyl acrylate, p-toryl acrylate and sorbyl
acrylate. The preferred hydrophobic monomer is
benzyl acrylate, benzyl methacrylate, 2-phenylethyl
methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate
or 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, of which homopolymer or
copolymer such as copolymer of methyl methacrylate
and butyl methacrylate can be used for block
copolymer.</p><p num="0031">Representative examples of the hydrophilic
monomer employable in the block copolymer include,
but are not limited to, methacrylic acid (MAA),
acrylic acid, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate
(DMAEMA), diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, tertbutylaminoethyl
methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl
acrylate, diethylaminoethyl acrylate, dimethylaminopropyl
methacrylamide, methacrylamide, acrylamide and
dimethyl-acrylamide. It is preferable to produce a
block copolymer utilizing homopolymer or copolymer of
methacrylic acid, acrylic acid or dimethylaminoethyl 
methacrylate.</p><p num="0032">Acid-containing polymer can be produced either
directly or from a monomer blocked by a blocking
group that is removed after the polymerization.
Examples of a blocked monomer to generate acrylic
acid or methacrylic acid after deblocking include
trimethylsilyl methacrylate (TMS-MAA), trimethylsilyl
acrylate, 1-butoxyethyl methacrylate, 1-ethoxyethyl
methacrylate, 1-butoxyethyl acrylate, 1-ethoxyethyl
acrylate, 2-tetrahydropyranyl acrylate and 2-tetrahydropyranyl
methacrylate.</p><p num="0033">When the head utilizing thermal energy is
driven at a high frequency, for example, at 5 kHz or
higher and in particularly 10 kHz or higher, use of
such a block copolymer is very effective in improving
the discharge properties.</p><p num="0034">The content of the resinous dispersant in the
ink is within a range of 0.5 to 10 weight%,
preferably 0.8 to 8 weight% and more preferably 1 to
6 weight%. Within such range, the viscosity of the
ink can be easily maintained in a range practical for
the ink jet ink.</p><heading>(iv, v) Glycerin and Ethylene Urea</heading><p num="0035">Glycerin and ethylene urea are critically
important components in maintaining high level ink
jet properties of the present invention such as
start-up property and anti-solidification resistance. 
Such ink jet properties are significantly affected by
following three factors:
<sl><li>(1) water-holding ability of ink when it is left

a certain extent from the ink; and</li><li>(3) re-solubility of solidified substance when
water has evaporated from the ink.</li></sl></p><p num="0036">Studying various solvents, the present
inventors have found that a combination of glycerin
and ethylene urea gives excellent solidification
resistance to the ink containing the aforementioned
components (ii) (pigment) and (iii) (dispersant),
particularly when the ink is used with a head for
minute droplet discharging.</p><p num="0037">At the same time, single use of these
substances was studied. First, if glycerin was added
to a level sufficient for providing solidification
resistance, the ink viscosity became too high to
achieve sufficient start-up property, since high
viscosity is unfavorable for this property. Also it
was found that high glycerin content sometimes caused
break of the thermal ink jet heater in a prolonged
printing durability test.</p><p num="0038">Next, single use of ethylene urea was studied
to find that sufficient solidification resistance was
not always obtained as required in the present 
invention. In addition, ethylene urea in an
excessive amount would result in kogation more
frequently in the prolonged printing durability test.
This kogation phenomenon is presumably attributed to
inhibition of the interaction of the pigment and the
resinous dispersant by excessive ethylene urea.</p><p num="0039">Based on the investigation result, the
inventors have found a suitable range of glycerin and
ethylene urea, which can provide satisfactory
solidification resistance without excessively
increasing the ink viscosity. In such a range, the
start-up property is much improved in comparison with
single use of one of these substances.</p><p num="0040">This is presumably because presence of ethylene
urea having a film forming ability at a gas-liquid
interface and glycerin allows formation of a film at
the tip of the nozzle, a film of such a delicate
strength that suppresses water evaporation but can be
broken by the discharge energy.</p><p num="0041">The content of glycerin is preferably within a
range of 3 to 15 weight%, more preferably 3.5 to 12
weight% and most preferably 4 to 10 weight% in view
of maintenance of satisfactory ink jet properties in
cooperation with ethylene urea.</p><p num="0042">Similarly the content of ethylene urea is
preferably within a range of 3 to 15 weight%, more
preferably 4 to 12 weight%, and most preferably 5 to 
10 weight%.</p><p num="0043">In the present invention, it is found that more
eminent effect can be obtained from the
aforementioned reasons if the mixing ratio by weight
of glycerin (A) and ethylene urea (B) is within a
range of A:B = 5:1 to 1:5, preferably 3:1 to 1:4 and
more preferably 1.5:1 to 1:3.</p><p num="0044">It was also found that the combination of
glycerin and ethylene urea provides satisfactory
storability for the pigment ink utilizing resinous
dispersant, in addition to the satisfactory start-up
property and solidification resistance.</p><p num="0045">With conventional ink employing a resinous
dispersant, the resinous dispersant tends to separate
from the pigment during prolonged storage to dissolve
into the aqueous medium, causing increase in the
particle size of the pigment or ink viscosity due to
the coagulation of the pigment particles of which
dispersion state was disrupted.</p><p num="0046">Such a phenomenon occurs not only at a high
temperature but also at a low temperature, differing
from the storability of dye ink.</p><p num="0047">Again, it was found that the combination use of
glycerin and ethyleneurea can suppress the increase
in the pigment particle size or ink viscosity during
storage not only at high-temperature (for example 30
to 70°C) but also at low-temperature (for example at 
0 to 10°C).</p><p num="0048">This is presumably because the interaction of
glycerin, ethylene urea and the resinous dispersant
surrounding the pigment reduces the tendency of the
resinous dispersant being separated from the pigment
and dissolved into the aqueous medium.</p><heading>(vi) Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether</heading><p num="0049">As explained above, the combined use of
glycerin and ethylene urea provides ink with
satisfactory in the start-up property, solidification
resistance and ink storability.</p><p num="0050">Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether having an HLB not
lower than 13 is the component that provides the ink
containing the components (i) to (v) with
adaptability for high-speed thermal ink jet recording,
without spoiling the preferred ink jet properties due
to the components (iv) and (v).</p><p num="0051">When the head heater of the thermal ink jet
head was observed by a microscope after the discharge
operation, the disrupted dispersion that will cause
kogation on the heater at the bubble forming
operation was not observed with addition of
polyoxyetheyelene alkyl ether having HLB not lower
than 13. Thus polyoxyetheyelene alkyl ether is
considered to have a function to re-dissolve the
product of disrupted dispersion. As already
explained, the combination of glycerin and ethylene 
urea has a strong ability of re-dissolving the
agglomerated pigment, and the combination of these
solvents and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether having an
HLB not lower than 13 is considered to
instantaneously re-dissolve the insoluble matters
formed on the heater surface due to disrupted
dispersion.</p><p num="0052">Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether mentioned above has
a structure represented by the following formula:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">R-O-(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>H</st32:che>
wherein R stands for an alkyl group, and n stands for
an integer of 10 to 40.</p><p num="0053">Examples of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether having
HLB not lower than 13 and not higher than 20 are not
particularly limited. In the foregoing formula,
alkyl group (R) in the hydrophobic portion may be of
any carbon number as long as surface activity can be
obtained. For example, it may be a lauryl, cetyl,
stearyl, oleyl or behenyl group, and is preferably an
alkyl group with 16 to 18 carbon atoms, more
preferably a cetyl group. On the other hand, the
number (n) of ethylene oxides in the hydrophilic
portion is preferably 10 to 40. The HLB is within a
range of 13 to 20, preferably 15 to 20 and more
preferably 17 to 20. Its content in the ink is
within a range of 0.1 to 3 weight%, preferably 0.2 to
2.5 weight% and more preferably 0.3 to 2 weight%. </p><p num="0054">In the present invention, a nonionic surfactant
may be used in addition to polyoxyethylene alkyl
ether. Examples of such a nonionic surfactant
include ethylene oxide addition product of acetylene
glycol, polyoxyethylene alkylphenylether,
polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester, sorbitan fatty acid
ester, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester.
In particular, ethylene oxide addition product of
acetylene glycol, when applied to the ink of the
present invention, provides a particularly excellent
effect in stabilizing the discharge speed. The
stabilized discharge speed allows to obtain an ink
jet image being uniform or with less unevenness.

Also a nonionic surfactants having HLB not lower than
10, more preferably not lower than 13, more
preferably not lower than 15 can be advantageously
employed. The content of such a surfactant used in
combination with polyoxyethylene alkyl ether in the
ink is within a range of 0.1 to 3 weight%, preferably
0.2 to 2.5 weight%, and more preferably 0.3 to 3
weight%.</p><heading>(vii) Other water-soluble organic solvents</heading><p num="0055">An optional component may be added to the ink
containing the components (i) to (vi) for obtaining
other various effects. Examples of such a component
(vii) include 2-pyrrolidone, ethylene glycol, glycols
with 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and triols with 4 to 6 
carbon atoms. One of more of such water-soluble
organic solvents may be added according to the
properties to be enhanced.</p><p num="0056">For example, to improve printing endurance, it
is preferred to include 2-pyrrolidone or ethylene
glycol in the ink. The present inventors consider
that 2-pyrrolidone or ethylene glycol re-dissolves
the disrupted dispersion product precipitated on the
heater during the bubble generating operation,
preventing accumulation on the heater to improve
printing endurance. The content of 2-pyrrolidone or
ethylene glycol in the ink is 0.5 to 10 weight%,
preferably 1 to 8 weight%.</p><p num="0057">To improve solidification resistance or start-up
property, it is preferable to include glycol of 3
to 6 carbon atoms or triol of 4 to 6 carbon atoms in
the ink. Any glycol with 3 to 6 carbon atoms or any
triol with 4 to 6 carbon atoms may be used, but
particularly preferred is diethylene glycol,
triethylene glycol, or 1, 2, 6-hexane-triol. These
substances, having a low vapor pressure and less
tendency to evaporate, are known as an excellent
solvent for improving the solidification resistance
and the start-up property. However, testing various
materials of low vapor pressure for the ink of the
present invention, the inventors have found that
glycols of 3 to 6 carbon atoms and triols of 4 to 6 
carbon atoms are particularly excellent to improve
the solidification resistance and the start-up
property without spoiling other properties. The
content of such glycol of 3 to 6 carbon atoms or
triol of 4 to 6 carbon atoms is within a range of 1
to 8 weight%, preferably 2 to 6 weight% of the total
weight of the ink.</p><p num="0058">Water-soluble organic solvents that may be
employed in the present invention other than those
described above include amides such as
dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; ketones or
ketoalcohols such as acetone and diacetone alcohol;
ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane;
oxyethylene or oxypropylene copolymers such as
tetraethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol,
polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol; lower
alkylethers such as ethylene glycol monomethyl (or
ethyl) ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl)
ether and triethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl)
ether; lower dialkylethers of polyhydric alcohols
such as triethylene glycol dimethyl (or ethyl) ether
and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl (or ethyl) ether;
alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine,
diethanolamine and triethanolamine; sulforane, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone
and trimethylol propane.</p><p num="0059">The total content of the aforementioned water-soluble 
organic solvents including glycerin and
ethylene urea, contained in the pigment ink of the
present invention, is not particularly limited, but
preferably within a range of 3 to 50 weight%, more
preferably 10 to 35 weight% of the total weight of
the ink. Also the water content of the pigment ink
is preferably within a range of 50 to 95 weight% of
the total weight of the ink.</p><p num="0060">Also the pigment ink of the present invention,
in order to obtain desired physical properties, may
further contain other additives such as a viscosity
adjusting agent, an antifoaming agent, an antiseptic,
an antimold agent, or an antioxidant. The surfactant
is preferably selected in such a manner that the
surface tension of the ink is not lower than 25 mN/m,
preferably not lower than 30 mN/m.</p><heading>&lt;Ink jet recording apparatus&gt;</heading><p num="0061">In FIG. 1, the ink jet printer is configured to

such a constitution, when the driving portion 1020 of

to comprise a belt 1016 that is wound on pulleys
1026a, 1026b provided on rotary shafts oppositely

process of the recording section 1010 is provided
opposite to the arrangement of the ink ejection

present invention is not limited to a particular
color, and, in a preferred embodiment, at least two
selected from the aforementioned yellow, magenta,

present invention. Also in another preferred
embodiment of the present invention, two different
inks that provide the same color hue image but having 
different coloring abilities, namely so-called dense
and pale inks, have the ink composition of the
present invention. Here, the same color hue image
means that when images of 360 dpi (dot per inch) x
720 dpi on plain paper are formed with the dense ink
and the pale ink respectively using an ink jet
recording head that ejects 20 to 50 pl droplets, and
thus obtained images are visually observed and are
classified into 10 Munsell categories (R, YR, Y, GY,
G, BG, B, PB, P and RP) based on the Munsell color
chart, and the images belong to the same category or
adjacent categories. Also a higher coloring ability
means that the ink contains the coloring material at
a relatively higher content.</p><p num="0067">In the above-described configuration, the ink
set of the present invention having different colors
or the set of dense and pale inks may be contained in
different cartridges as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Alternatively, inks may be contained in an ink

shown in Fig. 3, and the cartridge is detachably
mounted on an ink jet recording head 401 as shown in

mounted on the ink jet recording head 401 as shown in
Fig. 4, each of the inks of the present invention and
other inks is fed to the recording head and is 
discharged therefrom. Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate a
configuration in which the ink cartridge is

it is also possible a configuration in which the ink

the following tests. The ink jet recording apparatus
was a large color bubble-jet printer (BJ-W9000; Canon

discharge ink using thermal energy applied to the ink
according to the recording signals. With the thermal
heads of this apparatus, the droplet size per
discharge operation was about 8.5 pl.</p><heading>[Evaluation Items]</heading><heading>(1) Start-up properties</heading><p num="0096">The printer was left standing in the power-off
state in an environment of 25°C and 10% humidity, and
then in an environment of normal temperature and
normal humidity for two hours. After that, the power
was on, and the initial printing condition was
evaluated according to the following criteria. The
results of evaluation are shown in Table 1:
<sl><li>A: no difference from the printing condition prior
to the standing; </li><li>B: somewhat different from the printing condition
prior to the standing;</li><li>C: evidently different from the print state prior
to the standing.</li></sl></p><heading>(2) Solidification resistance</heading><p num="0097">The heads were detached from the main body of
the printer, and left standing for 1 week in an
environment of 35°C and 10% humidity. Then the heads
were mounted to the printer to evaluate whether
ordinary recovery operation can restore the printing
operation. The evaluation criteria are as follows:
<sl><li>A: printing is recovered with a single recovery
operation in the main body;</li><li>B: printing is recovered with several recovery
operations in the main body;</li><li>C: printing is not recovered by the recovery
operations in the main body.</li></sl></p><heading>(3) Durability in printing</heading><p num="0098">Using the above printer, 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> pulses of an
ink were discharged continuously from 20 nozzles at a
drive frequency of 7.5 kHz, designating these nozzles
as durability test nozzles. Then solid patterns were
printed using the durability test nozzles and other
nozzles not subjected to such continuous discharge
(control nozzles), and the difference in density of
the obtained solid patterns was visually evaluated.
If the dispersion state of the coloring material in 
the ink was destroyed in the vicinity of the heater
during high frequency drive of 7.5 kHz, a solidified
substance would have deposit on the heater face of
the durability test nozzles resulting in a difference
in the density between the solid pattern formed with
such durability test nozzles and one formed with the
control nozzles.
<sl><li>A: no density difference between the control
nozzles and the durability test nozzles;</li><li>B: some density difference between the control
nozzles and the durability test nozzles;</li><li>C: evident density difference between the control
nozzles and the durability test nozzles.</li></sl></p><heading>(4) Ink storage stability</heading><p num="0099">In a tightly stoppered glass bottle, 100 g of
ink was stored for 2 months in a thermostat of 0°C
and was evaluated for any change in viscosity and
particle size in comparison with the initial
conditions before storage:
<sl><li>A: differences in viscosity and particle size are
less than 5 % before and after the storage;</li><li>B: differences in viscosity and particle size are
less than 10 % before and after the storage;</li><li>C: differences in viscosity and particle size are
10 % or more before and after the storage.</li></sl></p><p num="0100">The results of evaluation of the items (1) to
