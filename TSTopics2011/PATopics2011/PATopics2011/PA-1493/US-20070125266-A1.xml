The weight ratio of the polymer component relative to the auxiliary component may be about 55/45 to 1/99. The proportion of the coloring agent may be about 0.001 to 100 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the organic solid component. Such a process ensures conveniently and industrially advantageous production of a colored particle (e.g., a colored polymer particle) corresponding to the dispersed phase independently of affinity between the dispersed phase and the matrix. </p></abstract><description lang="EN" load-source="us" status="new"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading>TECHNICAL FIELD </heading><p num="p-0002"> The present invention relates to a colored organic solid particle (e.g., a polymer particle) useful for a cosmetic, an image recording material (such as an ink or a colored particle) used for an ink jet printer or other means, a paint and varnish such as a powdered paint, and a coloring agent for a print ink, and a process for producing the particle, as well as a composition having a disperse system, which is useful for producing the organic solid particle. </p><heading>BACKGROUND ART </heading><p num="p-0003"> Heretofore, as a process for obtaining a colored fine particle of a thermoplastic resin, a mechanical pulverization (or crushing) method has been utilized, which comprises, for example, coarsely crushing a colored polymer composition obtained by melt-kneading a coloring component and a polymer by using a crushing machine or other means, then pulverizing the crushed matter finely by using a jet mill or other means, and classifying the resultant by an air classifier or other means. </p><p num="p-0004"> In such a method, however, manufacturing machines are expensive, and additionally, thus obtained particle is irregular in shape and widely varies in particle size. In order to make the polymer particle size uniform, the obtained particle should be classified. However, unusable polymer particles in size are produced in large quantities by classification, and are unfavorable from an economical viewpoint. Further, spherical fine particles are preferred from the viewpoint of blocking among particles, dispersibility, flowability or others, however, it is impossible to obtain spherical particles by mechanical pulverization (or crushing) methods. </p><p num="p-0005"> Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 275272/2002 (JP-2002-275272A, Patent Document 1) discloses a process for producing a colored fine particle polymer comprising melting a colored polymer having a coloring matter uniformly dispersed or dissolved in a thermoplastic resin, making the molten colored polymer a droplet-like fine particle in an insoluble medium having no solubility to the colored polymer, and cooling the droplet-like fine particle for solidification. In this process, however, the steps are complicated and a high temperature of the insoluble medium is required for dissolving the thermoplastic resin in the making step of the droplet-like particle. Therefore, the kind of the insoluble medium is limited to an organic solvent having a high boiling point. Moreover, in order to avoid fusing between the droplets in the cooling step, it is necessary to cool down to about 0Â° C., and it is impossible to stably obtain particles having a uniform particle size. </p><p num="p-0006"> Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 176065/1998 (JP-10-176065A, Patent Document 2) discloses a process for obtaining a spherical fine particle of a thermoplastic resin (a), which comprises melt-kneading the thermoplastic resin (a) to be powdered with other one or more of thermoplastic resin(s) (b) to give a polymer composition comprising the resin (a) constituting the dispersed phase and the resin (b) constituting the continuous phase, and washing the polymer composition with a solvent under conditions incapable of dissolving the resin (a) and capable of dissolving the resin (b). The document also mentions a process for adding various additives (including a pigment or a dye) to the resin (a). In this process, however, since the additive (such as a pigment or a dye) is also distributed to the resin (b) constituting the continuous phase, the additive such as a pigment cannot be effectively utilized as an agent for imparting a function to a resin and has an economical disadvantage. Moreover, in this process, it is necessary that the resin to be powdered is a resin excellent in solvent resistance and that the dispersed phase and the continuous phase are immiscible with each other. Further, it is necessary to appropriately select the combination of the resin constituting the continuous phase and the solvent depending on the kind of the resin of the dispersed phase. Therefore, not only the combination of these resins but also that of the resins and the solvent are limited to a specific one. Further, in the process of cooling the disperse composition, since resins immiscible with each other tend to induce a large phase separation, a fine particle having a given shape cannot be obtained due to reaggregation of once produced dispersed phase. Furthermore, the resin constituting the continuous phase is to be recovered in the end, or to be discarded in a dissolved state, as it is not included in the resin fine particle as a final product. However, recovery of the resin in the solution not only is very difficult but also is a caused factor of increase in the production cost of the polymer particle. Moreover, in the case of discarding the resin solution directly as a waste fluid, adverse effects on the environment cannot be ignored. </p><p num="p-0007"> Patent Document 1: JP-2002-275272A (claim 1) </p><p num="p-0008"> Patent Document 2: JP-10-176065A (claim 1, Paragraph No. [0042]) </p><heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading><heading>Problems to be Solved by the Invention </heading><p num="p-0009"> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a composition having a disperse system, which is capable of producing a colored particle corresponding to a dispersed phase (a colored organic solid particle such as a colored polymer particle) industrially with advantage by a convenient method independent of (i) miscibility or immiscibility between the dispersed phase and a matrix, and (ii) solvent resistance; a process for producing a colored particle from the composition; and the colored particle. </p><p num="p-0010"> It is another object of the present invention to provide a composition having a disperse system, which is capable of coloring a dispersed phase efficiently and utilizing a coloring agent with raising efficiency thereof, a process for producing a colored particle from the composition, and the colored particle. </p><p num="p-0011"> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a composition having a disperse system, which is capable of making a particle size of a colored particle smaller and narrowing the particle size distribution, and making the colored particle spherical; a process for producing a colored particle from the composition; and the colored particle. </p><p num="p-0012"> It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a composition having a disperse system, which is capable of reducing the burden on the environment due to a waste fluid or other factors, and a process for producing the colored particle. </p><heading>MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS </heading><p num="p-0013"> The inventor of the present invention made intensive studies to achieve the above objects and finally found that, in the case where a composition having a disperse system is formed from a meltable organic solid component in combination with a water-soluble auxiliary component comprising at least an oligosaccharide, selection of a coloring agent having a high affinity to an organic solid ensures to selectively distribute the coloring agent to the dispersed phase of the composition, and that, in the case of eluting or extracting the water-soluble auxiliary component being the matrix of the composition with an aqueous medium, the solution obtained by the elution hardly contains the coloring agent. The present invention was accomplished based on the above finding. </p><p num="p-0014"> That is, the composition having a disperse system (or the dispersion composition) of the present invention comprises a particulate dispersed phase comprising a meltable organic solid component (e.g., a polymer (or resin) component) (A) and a coloring agent (B), and a matrix comprising a water-soluble auxiliary component (C) comprising at least an oligosaccharide (C1), wherein the dispersed phase is dispersed in the matrix. The coloring agent (B) may comprise at least one member selected from the group consisting of a water-insoluble dye (or a dye sparingly soluble in water) (e.g., an oil-soluble dye) and an organic or an inorganic pigment. The proportion of the coloring agent (B) may be about 0.001 to 200 parts by weight (e.g., about 0.001 to 100 parts by weight) relative to 100 parts by weight of the organic solid component (A). </p><p num="p-0015"> The average particle size of the dispersed phase may be about 0.1 to 100 Î¼m, and the average particle size of the coloring agent (B) may be not more than 50% of the average particle size of the dispersed phase. The dispersed phase may be a spherical dispersed phase having a coefficient of variation of an average particle size of not more than 60 and a length ratio of a major axis relative to a minor axis of 1.5/1 to 1/1. The organic solid component (A) may comprise a thermoplastic resin having a weight-average molecular weight of not more than about 500,000. </p><p num="p-0016"> The oligosaccharide (C1) may comprise at least a tetrasaccharide. The oligosaccharide (C1) may comprise at least one member selected from the group consisting of a starch sugar, a galactooligosaccharide, a coupling sugar, a fructooligosaccharide, a xylooligosaccharide, a soybean oligosaccharide, a chitin oligosaccharide and a chitosan oligosaccharide. The viscosity of a 50% by weight aqueous solution of the oligosaccharide (C1) may be not lower than 1 PaÂ·s upon the viscosity being measured at a temperature of 25Â° C. by a B-type viscometer. </p><p num="p-0017"> The auxiliary component (C) may comprise the oligosaccharide (C1) and a water-soluble plasticizing component (C2) for plasticizing the oligosaccharide (C1). The oligosaccharide (C1) may show a melting point or softening point at a temperature higher than a heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A), or is decomposed at a temperature higher than the heat distortion temperature, and the melting point or softening point of the plasticizing component (C2) may be not higher than the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A). The plasticizing component (C2) may comprise at least one member selected from the group consisting of a saccharide and a sugar alcohol (e.g., erythritol, pentaerythritol, arabitol, ribitol, xylitol, sorbitol, dulcitol and mannitol). The ratio (weight ratio) of the oligosaccharide (C1) relative to the plasticizing component (C2) may be about 99/1 to 50/50. </p><p num="p-0018"> In the dispersion composition, the ratio (weight ratio) of the organic solid component (A) relative to the auxiliary component (C) may be about 55/45 to 1/99. </p><p num="p-0019"> The present invention also includes a process for producing a particle comprising an organic solid component (A) and a coloring agent (B) comprising eluting an auxiliary component (C) from the dispersion composition, and a particle obtainable by the process. The particle may be a spherical particle having an average particle size of 0.1 to 100 Î¼m, a coefficient of variation of the average particle size of not more than 60, and a length ratio of a major axis relative to a minor axis of 1.5/1 to 1/1. </p><p num="p-0020"> Incidentally, throughout this specification, the dispersion composition may be a composition (e.g., a polymer composition) for forming a disperse system containing an organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component), a coloring agent and an auxiliary component, and is sometimes used synonymously with the term âpolymer compositionâ accordingly. Moreover, in the specification, a colored organic solid component is sometimes simply referred to as an organic solid component; a colored polymer component is sometimes simply referred to as a polymer component; and a water-soluble auxiliary component is sometimes simply referred to as an auxiliary component. Incidentally, the term âsphericalâ shape is not limited to a finely spherical shape, and includes a shape having a length ratio of a major axis relative to a minor axis of about 1.5/1 to 1/1 (preferably about 1.2/1 to 1/1, and more preferably about 1.1/1 to 1/1). </p><p num="p-0021"> Incidentally, throughout this description, the meaning of the term âorganic solid componentâ includes not only a carbon-containing organic compound but also a silicon-containing compound (e.g., a silicone) as far as the compounds are in a solid form. </p><heading>EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0022"> According to the present invention, since a dispersed phase comprising an organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) and a coloring agent is dispersed in the form of a particle in a matrix comprising a specific water-soluble auxiliary component, independent of (i) affinity (miscibility or immiscibility) between the dispersed phase and the matrix, and (ii) solvent resistance, a colored particle (e.g., a colored polymer particle) corresponding to the dispersed phase can be produced industrially with advantage by a convenient method. Moreover, use of a coloring agent having a high affinity to the organic solid component as the coloring agent ensures to color the dispersed phase efficiently and to utilize the coloring agent efficiently with enhancing efficiency thereof. Since the coloring agent can be selectively distributed to the dispersed phase and the auxiliary component comprises a component derived from a natural product, the burden on the environment due to a waste fluid can be reduced. Further, the present invention ensures to reduce the particle size of the colored particle, narrow the particle size distribution, and make the particle spherical.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading><p num="p-0023"><figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a transmission electron micrograph of a colored polymer particle obtained in Example 2.</p><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading><p num="p-0024"> [Dispersion Composition]</p><p num="p-0025"> In the dispersion composition of the present invention, a particulate dispersed phase comprising a meltable organic solid component (A) and a coloring agent (B) is dispersed in a matrix comprising a water-soluble auxiliary component (C) containing at least an oligosaccharide (C1). </p><p num="p-0026"> (A) Meltable Organic Solid Component </p><p num="p-0027"> As the meltable (or thermoplastic) organic solid component (A), a component (water-insoluble component) immiscible with or hydrophobic relative to the water-soluble auxiliary agent (or component) (C) may be usually employed.

The master batch may be obtained by mixing the organic solid component [for example, a thermoplastic resin (e.g., a polymer of the same kind as the polymer component)] with the coloring agent by a conventional kneader (e.g., the above-mentioned kneader). The concentration of the coloring agent in the master batch is not particularly limited to a specific one, and may be a conventional concentration, e.g., about 5 to 20% by weight. </p><p num="p-0092"> In the dispersed phase, the proportion of the coloring agent (B) may be selected from the wide range of about 0.001 to 200 parts by weight (e.g., about 0.001 to 100 parts by weight) relative to 100 parts by weight of the organic solid component (A), and for example, may be about 0.001 to 70 parts by weight (e.g., about 0.001 to 50 parts by weight), preferably about 0.01 to 45 parts by weight (e.g., about 0.02 to 30 parts by weight) and more preferably about 0.05 to 20 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the organic solid component (A). </p><p num="p-0093"> (C) Water-Soluble Auxiliary Component </p><p num="p-0094"> The water-soluble auxiliary component comprises at least an oligosaccharide (C1). Moreover, in order to adjust a thermal fusing property of the oligosaccharide, the water-soluble auxiliary component may further comprise a water-soluble plasticizing component (C2) for plasticizing the oligosaccharide. By using the oligosaccharide (C1) and the water-soluble plasticizing component (C2) in combination, the viscosity of the water-soluble auxiliary component (C) can be adjusted in kneading with the organic solid component (A). Incidentally, the colored organic solid particle (e.g., a polymer particle) may be obtained by forming a dispersion composition by using the water-soluble auxiliary component in combination with the organic solid component and the coloring agent, and then suitably eluting or washing the water-soluble auxiliary component from the dispersion composition. </p><p num="p-0095"> (C1) Oligosaccharide </p><p num="p-0096"> The oligosaccharide (C1) is classified broadly into two groups: a homooligosaccharide condensed by dehydration of 2 to 10 monosaccharide molecules through glycoside linkage(s), and a heterooligosaccharide condensed by dehydration of 2 to 10 molecules of at least not less than two kinds of monosaccharides and/or sugar alcohols through glycoside linkage(s). The oligosaccharide (C1) may include, for example, a disaccharide to a decasaccharide, and usually, an oligosaccharide of a disaccharide to a hexasaccharide is employed. The oligosaccharide is usually a solid at a room temperature. Incidentally, these oligosaccharides may be an anhydrate. Moreover, in the oligosaccharide, a monosaccharide may bond (or link) with a sugar alcohol. Incidentally, the oligosaccharide may be an oligosaccharide composition comprising a plurality of sugar components. Such an oligosaccharide composition is sometimes simply referred to as an oligosaccharide. These oligosaccharides (or oligosaccharide compositions) may be used singly or in combination. </p><p num="p-0097"> Examples of the disaccharide may include a homooligosaccharide such as a trehalose (e.g., Î±, Î±-trehalose, Î²,Î²-trehalose, and Î±,Î²-trehalose), kojibiose, nigerose, maltose, isomaltose, sophorose, laminaribiose, cellobiose or gentiobiose; and a heterooligosaccharide such as lactose, sucrose, palatinose, melibiose, rutinose, primeverose or turanose. </p><p num="p-0098"> As the trisaccharide, there may be mentioned a homooligosaccharide such as maltotriose, isomaltotriose, panose or cellotriose; a heterooligosaccharide such as manninotriose, solatriose, melezitose, planteose, gentianose, umbelliferose, lactosucrose or raffinose; and others. </p><p num="p-0099"> Examples of the tetrasaccharide may include a homooligosaccharide such as maltotetraose or isomaltotetraose; and a heterooligosaccharide such as stachyose, cellotetraose, scorodose, lychnose, or a tetraose having a sugar or sugar alcohol attached to a reducing end of panose. </p><p num="p-0100"> Among these tetrasaccharides, the tetraose having a monosaccharide or sugar alcohol attached to a reducing end of panose is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 215892/1998 (JP-10-215892A), and may include a tetraose having a monosaccharide (such as glucose, fructose, mannose, xylose or arabinose) or a sugar alcohol (such as sorbitol, xylitol or erythritol) attached to a reducing end of panose. </p><p num="p-0101"> The pentasaccharide may include a homooligosaccharide such as maltopentaose or isomaltopentaose; and a heterooligosaccharide such as a pentaose having a disaccharide attached to a reducing end of panose. The pentaose having a disaccharide attached to a reducing end of panose is also disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 215892/1998 (JP-10-215892A), and may include a pentaose having a disaccharide (such as sucrose, lactose, cellobiose or trehalose) attached to a reducing end of panose. </p><p num="p-0102"> Examples of the hexasaccharide may include a homooligosaccharide such as maltohexaose or isomaltohexaose. </p><p num="p-0103"> The oligosaccharide preferably comprises at least a tetrasaccharide from the viewpoint of a melt-kneading property with the organic solid component. </p><p num="p-0104"> The oligosaccharide may be an oligosaccharide composition produced by decomposition of a polysaccharide. The oligosaccharide composition usually contains a tetrasaccharide. The oligosaccharide composition may include, for example, a starch sugar (a saccharification product of a starch (or a saccharified starch)), a galactooligosaccharide, a coupling sugar, a fructooligosaccharide, a xylooligosaccharide, a soybean oligosaccharide, a chitin oligosaccharide, and a chitosan oligosaccharide. </p><p num="p-0105"> For example, the starch sugar is an oligosaccharide composition obtained by making an acid or glucoamylase or the like act on a starch, and may be a mixture of an oligosaccharide obtained by bonding a plurality of glucoses to each other. The starch sugar may include, for example, a reduced starch-saccharified manufactured by Towa Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (brand name âPO-10â, the tetrasaccharide content is not less than 90% by weight). </p><p num="p-0106"> The galactooligosaccharide is an oligosaccharide composition obtained by making Î²-galactosidase or the like act on lactose, and may be a mixture of galactosyllactose and a galactose-(glucose)<sub>n </sub>(ânâ denotes an integer of 1 to 4). </p><p num="p-0107"> The coupling sugar is an oligosaccharide composition obtained by making cyclodextrin synthetase (CGTase) act on a starch and sucrose, and may be a mixture of a (glucose)<sub>n</sub>-sucrose (ânâ denotes an integer of 1 to 4). </p><p num="p-0108"> The fructooligosaccharide is an oligosaccharide composition obtained by making fructofuranosidase act on sucrose, and may be a mixture of a sucrose-(fructose)<sub>n </sub>(ânâ denotes an integer of 1 to 4). </p><p num="p-0109"> Concerning these oligosaccharide compositions, in order to inhibit rapid decrease of the viscosity in melt-kneading, the content of the trisaccharide or the tetrasaccharide (in particular, the tetrasaccharide) in the oligosaccharide composition may be, for example, not less than 60% by weight (about 60 to 100% by weight), preferably not less than 70% by weight (about 70 to 100% by weight), more preferably not less than 80% by weight (about 80 to 100% by weight), and particularly not less than 90% by weight (about 90 to 100% by weight). </p><p num="p-0110"> The oligosaccharide may be a reducing-type (maltose-type), or a non-reducing type (trehalose-type). The reducing-type oligosaccharide is preferred because of excellence in heat resistance. </p><p num="p-0111"> The reducing-type oligosaccharide is not particularly limited to a specific one as far as the oligosaccharide has a free aldehyde group or ketone group to exhibit a reducing property. For example, the reducing-type oligosaccharide may include a disaccharide such as kojibiose, nigerose, maltose, isomaltose, sophorose, laminaribiose, cellobiose, gentiobiose, lactose, palatinose, melibiose, rutinose, primeverose or turanose; a trisaccharide such as maltotriose, isomaltotriose, panose, cellotriose, manninotriose or solatriose; a tetrasaccharide such as maltotetraose, isomaltotetraose, cellotetraose or lychnose; a pentasaccharide such as maltopentaose or isomaltopentaose; and a hexasaccharide such as maltohexaose or isomaltohexaose. </p><p num="p-0112"> Since the oligosaccharide is generally a natural polysaccharide derivative, or a product derived from a natural product being manufactured by reducing the derivative, use of the oligosaccharide can reduce in the burden on the environment. </p><p num="p-0113"> In order to effectively disperse the organic solid component and the auxiliary component by kneading, it is desirable that the oligosaccharide has a high viscosity. More specifically, in the case where the viscosity of the 50% by weight aqueous solution of the oligosaccharide is measured at a temperature of 25Â° C. by using a B-type viscometer, the viscosity is not lower than 1 PaÂ·s (e.g., about 1 to 500 PaÂ·s), preferably not lower than 2 PaÂ·s (e.g., about 2 to 250 PaÂ·s, and in particular about 3 to 100 PaÂ·s), more preferably not lower than 4 PaÂ·s (e.g., about 4 to 50 PaÂ·s), and particularly not lower than 6 PaÂ·s (e.g., about 6 to 50 PaÂ·s), and it is preferred to use an oligosaccharide having a high viscosity. </p><p num="p-0114"> Moreover, the melting point or softening point of the oligosaccharide (C1) is preferably higher than the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A) (e.g., a melting point or softening point of the organic solid component (A), and a Vicat softening temperature defined by JIS K 7206). Incidentally, depending on the kind or species of the oligosaccharide [e.g., in the case of a starch sugar such as a reduced starch saccharified], the oligosaccharide sometimes decomposed (thermally decomposed) without showing a melting point or softening point. In such a case, the decomposition temperature may be considered as the âmelting point or softening pointâ of the oligosaccharide (C1). </p><p num="p-0115"> The temperature difference between the melting point or softening point of the oligosaccharide (C1) and the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (A) is, for example, not less than 1Â° C. (e.g., about 1 to 80Â° C.), preferably not less than 10Â° C. (e.g., about 10 to 70Â° C.), and more preferably not less than 15Â° C. (e.g., about 15 to 60Â° C.). The melting point or softening point of the oligosaccharide (C1) may be selected from the range of 70 to 300Â° C. depending on the kind of the organic solid component (A) and other factor(s), and may be, for example, about 90 to 290Â° C., preferably about 100 to 280Â° C. (e.g., about 110 to 270Â° C.), and more preferably about 120 to 260Â° C. (e.g., about 130 to 260Â° C.). Incidentally, an anhydride of an oligosaccharide generally has a high melting point or softening point. For example, in the case of a trehalose, the melting point of the dihydrate is 97Â° C. and that of the anhydride is 203Â° C. In the case where the melting point or softening point of the oligosaccharide is higher than the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (A) (e.g., a polymer component), the oligosaccharide can be not only prevented from rapid deterioration of the viscosity in melt-kneading but also inhibited from thermal degradation. </p><p num="p-0116"> (C2) Water-Soluble Plasticizing Component </p><p num="p-0117"> The water-soluble plasticizing component (C2) is enough to just express a phenomenon that the oligosaccharide (C1) hydrates to turn into a syrup state, and may include, for example, a saccharide, and a sugar alcohol. These plasticizing components may be used singly or in combination. </p><p num="p-0118"> (a) Saccharide </p><p num="p-0119"> As the saccharide, a monosaccharide and/or a disaccharide is usually employed for plasticizing the oligosaccharide (C1) effectively. These saccharides may be used singly or in combination. </p><p num="p-0120"> Examples of the monosaccharide may include a triose, a tetrose, a pentose, a hexose, a heptose, an octose, a nonose, and a decose. These compounds may be an aldose or ketose compound, a dialdose compound (for example, a compound which is a saccharide derivative and has aldehyde groups in both ends of the carbon chain, such as tetraacetylgalacto-hexodialdose, ido-hexodialdose or xylo-pento-dialdose), a monosaccharide having a plurality of carbonyl groups (e.g., an aldoalko-ketose such as osone or onose), a monosaccharide having a methyl group (e.g., a methyl sugar such as altromethylose), a monosaccharide having an acyl group (in particular, e.g., a C<sub>2-4</sub>acyl group such as acetyl group) (for example, an acetylated product of the above-mentioned aldose compound, e.g., an acetylated product such as a pentaacetylated product of an aldehyde glucose), a saccharide having an introduced carboxyl group (e.g., a saccharic acid or a uronic acid), a thiosugar, an amino sugar, a deoxy sugar, or others. </p><p num="p-0121"> Concrete examples of such a monosaccharide may include a tetrose (e.g., erythrose, and threorose), a pentose (e.g., arabinose, ribose, lyxose, deoxyribose, and xylose), and a hexose (e.g., allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, fructose, sorbose, fucose, rhamnose, talose, galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, mannuronic acid, and glucosamine). </p><p num="p-0122"> Moreover, the monosaccharide may be a cyclic isomer having a cyclic structure formed through a hemiacetal linkage. It is not necessary that the monosaccharide has an optical activity (or rotatory polarization), and the monosaccharide may be any one of D-form, L-form, or DL-form. These monosaccharides may be used singly or in combination. </p><p num="p-0123"> The disaccharide is not particularly limited to a specific one as far as the disaccharide can plasticize the oligosaccharide (C1). For example, among the above-mentioned disaccharides, there may be exemplified a disaccharide having a low melting point or low softening point (e.g., gentiobiose, melibiose, and trehalose (dehydrate)), and a disaccharide corresponding to a homo- and heterodisaccharide of the above-mentioned monosaccharide (e.g., an aldobiouronic acid such as glucuronoglucose in which glucuronic acid binds to glucose through an Î±-1,6-glycoside linkage). </p><p num="p-0124"> The saccharide is preferably a reducing sugar in terms of having an excellent thermal stability. Examples of such a saccharide include a free monosaccharide, and in addition, a reducing sugar having a low melting point or low softening point (e.g., gentiobiose, and melibiose) among the disaccharides. </p><p num="p-0125"> (b) Sugar Alcohol </p><p num="p-0126"> As the sugar alcohol, a linear (or chain) sugar alcohol such as an alditol (glycitol) or a cyclic sugar alcohol such as an inositol may be used, and usually, the linear sugar alcohol may be employed. These sugar alcohols may be used singly or in combination. </p><p num="p-0127"> Examples of the linear sugar alcohol may include a tetrytol (e.g., threitol, and erythritol), a pentitol [e.g., pentaerythritol, arabitol, ribitol (adonitol), xylitol, and lyxitol], a hexitol [e.g., sorbitol, mannitol, iditol, gulitol, talitol, dulcitol (galactitol), allo-dulcitol (allitol), and altritol], a heptitol, an octitol, a nonitol, a decitol, and a dodecitol. </p><p num="p-0128"> Among these sugar alcohols, the preferred sugar alcohol includes erythritol, pentaerythritol, arabitol, ribitol, xylitol, sorbitol, dulcitol and mannitol. The sugar alcohol often comprises at least one sugar alcohol selected from the group consisting of erythritol, pentaerythritol and xylitol. </p><p num="p-0129"> The plasticizing component (C2) may be a liquid (or in a syrup state) at a room temperature (e.g., about 15 to 20Â° C.), and from the viewpoint of handleability and others, the plasticizing component (C2) is usually a solid in many cases. In the case where the auxiliary component (C) comprises the oligosaccharide (C1) and the plasticizing component (C2), the plasticizing component (C2) can effectively plasticize or soften the oligosaccharide (C1) even when the oligosaccharide (C1) is a thermally decomposable oligosaccharide not having a clear melting point or softening point. </p><p num="p-0130"> The melting point or softening point of the plasticizing component (C2) is usually not higher than the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A) (for example, not higher than a melting point or softening point of the organic solid component (A), and a Vicat softening temperature defined by JISK 7206). Incidentally, some plasticizing components are molten at a temperature lower than the actual melting point when coexisting with the oligosaccharide while having a high melting point (e.g., a melting point of not lower than 200Â° C.). For example, pentaerythritol exerts a plasticizing effect on the oligosaccharide and melts at a temperature (e.g., at about 160 to 180Â° C.) lower than the actual melting point (260Â° C.). The plasticizing component having such a high melting point cannot be singly utilized because of being not molten at the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component). However, such a plasticizing component can be utilized effectively in combination with the oligosaccharide. Incidentally, in the plasticizing component exerting a plasticizing effect on the oligosaccharide (e.g., pentaerythritol) at a temperature lower than the actual melting point, the temperature at which a plasticizing effect on the oligosaccharide is exerted may be regarded as the âmelting point or softening pointâ of the plasticizing component (C2). </p><p num="p-0131"> The melting point or softening point of the auxiliary component (C) may be not higher or lower than the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A). It is sufficient that the organic solid component (A) and the auxiliary component (C) are molten or soften at least at a kneading temperature (or fabrication temperature). For example, the temperature difference between the melting point or softening point of the auxiliary component (C) and the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A) may be selected from the range of 0 to 100Â° C. For example, the temperature difference may be about 3 to 80Â° C. (e.g., about 3 to 55Â° C.), preferably about 5 to 60Â° C. (e.g., about 5 to 45Â° C.), and more preferably about 5 to 40Â° C. (e.g., about 10 to 35Â° C.). Incidentally, in the case where the temperature difference between the melting point or softening point of the auxiliary component (C) and the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A) is small (e.g., in the case where the temperature difference is about 0 to 20Â° C.), there is an advantage that the dispersion shape can be fixed in a short time by an auxiliary component (C) (e.g., a sugar component) having a high solidification rate. </p><p num="p-0132"> Further, the melt flow rate of the auxiliary component (C) (e.g., an auxiliary component comprising the oligosaccharide (C1) and the plasticizing component (C2)) may be, for example, not less than 1 (e.g., about 1 to 40), preferably not less than 5 (e.g., about 5 to 30), and more preferably not less than 10 (e.g., about 10 to 20) when measured the melt flow rate defined by JIS K 7210 at a temperature 30Â° C. higher than the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A) [e.g., at a temperature 30Â° C. higher than a melting point or softening point of the organic solid component (A), and the Vicat softening temperature]. </p><p num="p-0133"> In the auxiliary component (C), the ratio (weight ratio) of the plasticizing component (C2) is selected from the range that the plasticizing component can plasticize the oligosaccharide (C1) efficiently without localizing by aggregation or other reason accompanying melt-kneading. For example, the ratio of the oligosaccharide (C1) relative to the plasticizing component (C2) [the oligosaccharide (C1)/the plasticizing component (C2)] may be selected from 99/1 to 50/50, and may be preferably about 95/5 to 60/40 and more preferably about 90/10 to 70/30. </p><p num="p-0134"> The ratio (weight ratio) of the organic solid component (A) relative to the auxiliary component (C) may be selected depending on the kinds or viscosities of the organic solid component and the auxiliary component, the miscibility between the organic solid component and the auxiliary component, or other factor(s), and is not particularly limited to a specific one. The ratio [the organic solid component (A)/the auxiliary component (C)] may be usually selected from the range that formability (or moldability) of the dispersion composition is not impaired, and may be, for example, about 55/45 to 1/99, preferably about 50/50 to 5/95 and more preferably about 45/55 to 10/90. </p><p num="p-0135"> In the present invention, the dispersion composition or the composition may contain, if necessary, various additives, for example, other additive such as a filler (e.g., a particulate filler, and a fibrous filler such as a glass fiber), a plasticizer or a softener, an agent for imparting photodegradable property (e.g., an anatase-formed titanium oxide), a lubricant, a stabilizer (e.g., a heat stabilizer, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet ray absorbing agent, and a weather (light) stabilizer), an ultraviolet-scattering agent (e.g., a powder of a metal oxide such as titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, zinc oxide, or iron oxide), a dispersing agent, a flame retardant, an antistatic agent, a charge control agent (e.g., a positive charge control agent such as a nigrosin dye, a triphenylmethane-series dye, a quaternary ammonium salt, a guanidine compound, an imidazole compound, or an amine-series compound; and a negative charge control agent such as a metal complex of salicylic acid, a metal complex of an azo dye, a copper phthalocyanine dye, a nitroimidazole derivative, or a urea derivative), a superplasticizer (or an agent for imparting fluidization), a wax [for example, an olefinic wax such as a polyethylene wax, an ethylene copolymer wax, or a polypropylene wax; a paraffin wax; a higher fatty acid or a derivative thereof (e.g., a salt, a polyhydric alcohol ester, and an amide); and an ester-series wax], or a crosslinking agent.

In an application of image recording material such as a toner, for example, the charge control agent, the superplasticizer, the wax, and others may be used. Moreover, in an application of paint and varnish, or the like, for example, there may be used the crosslinking agent, the weather (light) stabilizer, the ultraviolet ray absorbing agent, and the superplasticizer. </p><p num="p-0137"> In these additives, the amount of each additive may be an effective amount, and for example, the total amount of the additives may be selected from the range of about 0 to 100 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the organic solid component. For example, the total amount of the additives may be about 0 to 50 parts by weight (e.g., about 0 to 30 parts by weight), preferably about 0.05 to 20 parts by weight (e.g., about 0.1 to 20 parts by weight), and more preferably about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight (e.g., about 0.5 to 10 parts by weight), relative to 100 parts by weight of the organic solid component. </p><p num="p-0138"> In the dispersion composition of the present invention, the average particle size of the dispersed phase is not particularly limited to a specific one, and may be selected from the range of about 0.1 Î¼m to 1 mm (e.g., about 0.1 to 800 Î¼m) as usage. For example, the average particle size may be, for example, about 0.1 to 500 Î¼m, preferably about 0.1 to 100 Î¼m (e.g., about 0.5 to 80 Î¼m), more preferably about 0.2 to 50 Î¼m (e.g., about 0.5 to 50 Î¼m), and particularly about 1 to 40 Î¼m (e.g., about 1 to 20 Î¼m). Moreover, the average particle size of the dispersed phase may be, for example, about 0.1 to 10 Î¼m (e.g., about 0.2 to 5 Î¼m), and preferably about 0.5 to 3 Î¼m (e.g., about 0.5 to 2 Î¼m). </p><p num="p-0139"> In the present invention, the particle size of the dispersed phase can be uniformized and the particle size distribution of the particle size can be narrowed.

The preferred shape of the disperse phase is a spherical shape. The spherical dispersion composition (or spherical particle) is not limited to a finely spherical shape, and for example, includes a shape having a length ratio of a major axis relative to a minor axis of, e.g., about 1.5/1 to 1/1. The length ratio of the major axis relative to the minor axis [the major axis/the minor axis] may be preferably about 1.3/1 to 1/1 (e.g., about 1.2/1 to 1/1), and more preferably about 1.1/1 to 1/1. </p><p num="p-0141"> The dispersion composition may be prepared by kneading the organic solid component (A), the coloring agent (B) (including a master batch containing the coloring agent) and the auxiliary component (C), and usually, the kneaded composition is often shaped (or molded) to prepare a preliminary shaped article. The kneading operation may be carried out by using a conventional kneading machine (e.g., a uniaxial or biaxial screw extruder, a kneader, and a calendar roll). Moreover, in advance of kneading, each of components may be preliminarily converted into a powder form by a machine such as a freeze grinder or may be preliminarily kneaded by a Henschel mixer, a tumbler mixer, a ball mill or others. </p><p num="p-0142"> Examples of the shaping (or molding) method may include an extrusion molding, an injection molding, a blow molding, and a calendar molding. In view of productivity or easiness of processing, an extrusion molding or an injection molding is usually applied. The shape of the preliminary shaped article (or dispersion composition) is not particularly limited to a specific one, and may be a zero-dimensional shape (e.g., a particle shape, and a pellet shape), a one-dimensional shape (e.g., a strand shape, and a rod or bar shape), a two-dimensional shape (e.g., a plate shape, a sheet shape, and a film shape), a three-dimensional shape (e.g., a tubular shape, and a block shape), and others. Considering the elution property (or elution capability) of the auxiliary component, it is desirable to process (or shape) the dispersion composition into a strand shape, a rod or bar shape, a sheet shape, or a film shape. </p><p num="p-0143"> The water-soluble auxiliary component may be eluted from the kneaded matter, and the water-soluble auxiliary component is usually eluted by shaping (or molding) after kneading. </p><p num="p-0144"> Incidentally, it is possible to appropriately set the kneading temperature or processing (or shaping) temperature (or fabrication temperature) depending on a raw material to be used (e.g., the organic solid component and the auxiliary component). For example, the kneading temperature or processing temperature is about 90 to 300Â° C., preferably about 110 to 260Â° C. (e.g., about 170 to 250Â° C.), more preferably about 140 to 240Â° C. (e.g., about 170 to 240Â° C.), and particularly about 170 to 230Â° C. (e.g., about 180 to 220Â° C.). In order to avoid thermal decomposition of the auxiliary component (the oligosaccharide and the plasticizing component), the kneading temperature or processing temperature may be set to a temperature not higher than 230Â° C. Moreover, the kneading time may be, for example, selected from the range of 10 seconds to one hour, and is usually about 30 seconds to 45 minutes, and preferably about 1 to 30 minutes (e.g., 1 to 10 minutes). </p><p num="p-0145"> The molten mixture (e.g., a kneaded matter, and a preliminary shaped article) obtained by kneading and/or processing (or fabrication) may be suitably cooled, if necessary. By cooling the molten mixture in such a way, even in the case where the organic solid component (A), the coloring agent (B) and the auxiliary component (C) are miscible with one another in the molten state, a dispersed phase can be formed due to differences in surface tension and solidification rate such as crystallization rate between the organic solid component and the auxiliary component along with cooling. </p><p num="p-0146"> The cooling temperature may be at least about 10Â° C. lower than the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component (e.g., a polymer component) (A) or the melting point or softening point of the auxiliary component (C), and for example, may be about 10 to 100Â° C. lower than the above temperature (the heat distortion temperature of the organic solid component, or the melting point or softening point of the auxiliary component), preferably about 15 to 80Â° C. lower than the above temperature, and more preferably about 20 to 60Â° C. lower than the above temperature. Specifically, for example, the cooling temperature may be selected from the range of 5 to 150Â° C. depending on the kind of the organic solid component or the auxiliary component, and may be, for example, about 10 to 120Â° C. (e.g., about 10 to 60Â° C.), preferably about 15 to 100Â° C. (e.g., about 15 to 50Â° C.), and more preferably about 20 to 80Â° C. (e.g., about 20 to 40Â° C.). The cooling time may be suitably set according to the kind of the organic solid component or the auxiliary component, the cooling temperature, and others, and may be selected, for example, from the broad range of 30 seconds to 20 hours. For example, the cooling time may be about 45 seconds to 10 hours, preferably about one minute to 5 hours (e.g., about one minute to one hour), and more preferably about 1.5 to 30 minutes. </p><p num="p-0147"> Moreover, by adjusting the miscibility between the organic solid component and the auxiliary component, the kneading conditions (e.g., the kneading time, and the kneading temperature), the processing temperature and the cooling conditions (e.g., the cooling time, and the cooling temperature), the average particle size of the dispersed phase (or particle) may be changed or the width of the particle size distribution may be further narrowed. </p><p num="p-0148"> Thus obtained dispersion composition has a phase separation structure in which the auxiliary component (C) forms a continuous phase of an islands-in-the-sea structure and the organic solid component (A) and the coloring agent (B) form an independent dispersed phase thereof. Therefore, the auxiliary component can be quickly eluted or extracted to give the dispersed phase (the colored organic solid phase) as a particle. </p><p num="p-0149"> [Production Process of Colored Particle]</p><p num="p-0150"> According to the present invention, a particle comprising the organic solid component (A) and the coloring agent (B) is produced by eluting the water-soluble auxiliary component (C) from the dispersion composition. </p><p num="p-0151"> The elution (or washing) of the water-soluble auxiliary component (C) may be carried out by using an aqueous solvent, for example, water, and a water-soluble solvent [e.g., an alcohol compound (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, and butanol), and an ether compound (e.g., a cellosolve, and a butyl cellosolve)]. These aqueous solvents may be used singly or in combination. The preferred elution solvent is water because of the low burden on the environment and the industrial cost reduction. </p><p num="p-0152"> The elution of the auxiliary component (C) may be conducted by a conventional method, for example, by immersing and dispersing the dispersion composition (or preliminary shaped article) in the aqueous medium, and eluting or washing the auxiliary component from the dispersion composition (or moving over the auxiliary component to the phase of the aqueous solvent). In the case where the dispersion composition (or preliminary shaped article thereof) is immersed in the aqueous medium, the water-soluble auxiliary component forming the matrix of the dispersion composition is gradually eluted and the dispersed phase (particle) is dispersed in the mixture obtained by the elution. In order to accelerate the dispersion and elution of the auxiliary component, stirring or other means may be suitably conducted. </p><p num="p-0153"> Incidentally, according to the present invention, since a coloring agent having a higher affinity to the organic solid component (A) than the water-soluble auxiliary component (C) (e.g., an oil-insoluble dye or pigment) is used as the coloring agent (B), the coloring agent can be distributed to the dispersed phase (dispersion particle) without being substantially distributed to the aqueous phase (the water-soluble auxiliary component (C) and the aqueous medium), and the efficiency of the coloring agent can be enhanced. Therefore, the present invention is advantageous from industrial point of view. In the case of using, as the coloring agent, a dye or pigment having a higher degree of affinity to the organic solid component (A) than that of affinity to the water-soluble auxiliary component (C), the distribution factor of the coloring agent to the dispersed phase can be increased, the content of the coloring agent in the eluate can be drastically decreased (substantially to zero), and the burden on the environment can be reduced. </p><p num="p-0154"> The auxiliary component may be eluted, for example, under an applied pressure, and usually, can be eluted under an atmospheric pressure (e.g., about 1Ã10<sup>5 </sup>Pa) or a reduced pressure. Moreover, the elution temperature of the auxiliary component may be appropriately established depending on the organic solid component and the auxiliary component. The elution temperature of the auxiliary component is usually a temperature lower than the melting point or softening point of the organic solid material, and is, for example, about 10 to 100Â° C., preferably about 25 to 90Â° C., and more preferably 30 to 80Â° C. (e.g., about 40 to 80Â° C.). Since the water-soluble auxiliary component of the present invention is easily soluble in water, a large amount of water is not required. Moreover, since the auxiliary component has a low molecular weight, the viscosity of the resultant mixture is low and the obtained particle can be easily collected. </p><p num="p-0155"> The colored particle may be collected from a dispersion liquid containing the dispersed particle by a conventional separation (collecting) method, e.g., filtration and centrifugation. It is desirable that the obtained colored particle has no residual auxiliary component. However, for example, in view of cost reduction of the washing process, the multiple particle may have a small amount of the residual auxiliary component. The small amount of the auxiliary component in the colored particle does not significantly affect the obtained particle and has a high safety because the auxiliary component is a compound derived from a natural product (including a food product or a food additive). Incidentally, the proportion of the auxiliary component (C) in the colored particle may be, for example, not more than 3% by weight. </p><p num="p-0156"> Incidentally, the auxiliary component eluted or extracted with the solvent may be collected by a conventional separation means (e.g., distillation, concentration, recrystallization, and drying (freeze drying)). </p><p num="p-0157"> The present invention also includes a colored organic solid particle (e.g., a polymer particle) obtained by the production process. The configuration (or shape), the average particle size and the coefficient of variation of the average particle size of the particle (e.g., a polymer particle) may be selected from the same range as the above-mentioned dispersed phase. Moreover, the length ratio of the major axis relative to the minor axis in the particle may be also selected from the same range as the above-mentioned dispersed phase. Incidentally, the configuration (or shape) or size of the particle is retained that of the intact dispersed phase unless the organic solid component (A) is eluted in the elution solvent (aqueous solvent). Incidentally, if necessary, the particle size of the particle may be made uniform by a means such as classification. </p><heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading><p num="p-0158"> In the case where the colored particle (e.g., a colored polymer particle) of the present invention is visually observed, the colored particle often expresses a more whitish color than the original color of the coloring agent (C) by light-scattering property of the particle. By using such a light-scattering effect, the colored particle may be available for a cosmetic (e.g., a foundation, a face powder, a blusher, and an eye shadow) or others. Moreover, the colored particle may be also utilized for an image-recording material such as an ink (including a polymer ink) or a colored toner usable for an ink jet printing or others, a paint and varnish or a coating agent (e.g., a powdered paint, or a coating material for a slurry painting), and a coloring agent for a print ink. Incidentally, the colored particle may be used for improving the mix aptitude to other fine particle (e.g., an inorganic fine particle), or may be used as an antiblocking agent (e.g., an antiblocking agent for a shaped article), a spacer (e.g., a spacer for a liquid crystal), an additive for sheet or film, an abrasive for chemical and mechanical polishing (CMP) of semiconductor, and others. </p><p num="p-0159"> Moreover, the colored polymer particle obtained by using a biodegradable polymer component is useful for a raw material or additive in a fine chemical field such as an agricultural chemical, a medicine (or a pharmaceutical), a paint and varnish (e.g., a powdered paint, and a ship bottom paint), a coating agent or an adhesive agent because of being excellent in biodegradability. Further, the colored polymer particle may be also utilized as an additive to a film or sheet for agriculture, forestry and fisheries, civil engineering, and construction; a material for sanitary goods (e.g., a disposable diaper); a medical material requiring biodegradation and bioabsorbability; or a sustained release material requiring sustained release. </p><heading>EXAMPLES </heading><p num="p-0160"> The following examples are intended to describe this invention in further detail and should by no means be interpreted as defining the scope of the invention. </p><heading>Examples 1 to 11 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 </heading><p num="p-0161"> In each Examples, a polymer composition comprising a polymer component, a water-soluble auxiliary component and a coloring agent component having a formulation shown in Tables 1 and 2 was melt-kneaded at a preset temperature (processing temperature) of 200Â° C. for 5 minutes by using a brabender (manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd., laboplastmill), and then cooled to prepare a dispersion composition. The obtained dispersion composition was immersed in hot water of 60Â° C. to give a suspension of a polymer particle. The insoluble matter was separated from the suspension by using a membrane (having a pore size of 0.45 Î¼m, and made of a polyvinylidene fluoride) to collect the polymer fine particle and an aqueous solution (extracted aqueous solution) containing the auxiliary component dissolved therein, separately. The color of the obtained polymer fine particle and that of the extracted aqueous solution containing the auxiliary were visually observed. </p><p num="p-0162"> Moreover, after drying the polymer fine particle, the configuration (or shape) of the polymer particle was observed by using a scanning electron microscope, and the weight-average molecular weight of the polymer particle and the average particle size thereof were determined in accordance with the following manner. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a scanning electron microscope (3000 magnifications) of a colored polymer particle obtained in Example 2. </p><p num="p-0163"> (Weight-Average Molecular Weight) </p><p num="p-0164"> The weight-average molecular weight was calculated in terms of a standard polystyrene by a gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). </p><p num="p-0165"> (Average Particle Size) </p><p num="p-0166"> The dried polymer particle was redispersed at an adequate amount in pure water to prepare a suspension, and the number average particle size of the polymer fine particle was determined by using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation, âSALD-2000Jâ).
