and coatings, particularly for automotive applications.</p></abstract><description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><heading><b><i><u style="single">Background of the Invention</u></i></b></heading><p num="0001">This invention relates to novel reactive urethane compounds, their synthesis and end-uses
particularly in automotive coatings with improved chemical resistance and
mechanical properties. In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to automotive
paint compositions having hydroxy functional binders and a cross-linking agent such
as melamine, urea or benzoguanamine formaldehyde resins (so called aminoplast
resins) and/or blocked polyisocyanates (when the curing temperature is relatively
high, i.e., above 80°C) in a one-pack formulation or polyisocyanates (when the
crosslinking needs to take place at lower temperatures) in 2-pack formulations.</p><p num="0002">Acrylic polyols are typically used in topcoat formulation because of the outstanding
durability. However,the mechanical properties like chip resistance and scratch
resistance are poor. Polyester polyols do give better mechanical properties but are
poor for chemical resistance, specifically acid etch resistance. Polyurethane polyols
combine excellent chemical and mechanical properties with very good durability.</p><p num="0003">US patent numbers 4,485,228 and 4,540,766 describe high solids coating systems
based on low molecular weight polyester urethane polyols. More particularly US
4,485,228 describes compositions crosslinked with polyisocyanates in a 2-pack
system while US 4,540,766 describes 1-pack systems crosslinked with
polyisocyanates. In those patents the polyester urethane polyols are prepared by a
stoichiometric excess of a polyester polyol with a polyisocyanate to avoid high
molecular weight build-up during the synthesis.</p><p num="0004">US 4,543,405 refers to low molecular weight polyurethane polyols which are prepared
from a polyisocyanate with a large excess of a polyol. This excess of polyol is, after
the reaction has completed, distilled-off. In related US patent numbers 4,540,771 and
4,605,724 the polyester polyols for the polyurethane polyols are produced from
polycarboxylic acids or lactone with low molecular weight polyol, wherein the excess
polyol is also removed by distillation. The disadvantage of the procedure in above
mentioned references is the distillation step which is not economic.</p><p num="0005">EP 0 661 316 and EP 0 866 082 relate to reactive urea/urethane compounds, the
process for preparation and coatings based on those compounds which are prepared
from the reaction of a polyisocyanate with a secondary amine containing one or two
hydroxyl groups. The advantage of this process is the fact that the reaction of the 
isocyanate group preferentially goes with the secondary amine group to form low
molecular weight hydroxyfunctional urethane-urea adducts. The disadvantage is that
urea groups have a strong hydrogen bonding character which leads to limited
solubility and relatively high solution viscosity. US 5,130,405 and US 5,175,227 are
directed to high solids coating compositions containing polyurethane oligomers
derived from the reaction of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3-diols and
polyisocyanates. Such compounds do have very low molecular weight with high
hydroxyl values. Low molecular weight oligomers with high hydroxyl values act as
strong slow solvents and many times negatively influence the appearance of
automotive clear coats. EP 0 767 230, EP 0 767 187, EP 0 767 226, EP 0 767 228, EP
0 767 231, EP 0 767 229, EP 0 767 232 and EP 0 767 227 all relate to curable coating
compositions having carbamate functional groups for crosslinking purposes. The
carbamate functional groups can be represented by
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.matrixware.com/ns/st32/">-O-CO-NH-R</st32:che>
wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl, preferably C1-C4 alkyl and more preferably
hydrogen. Primary carbamates (R=hydrogen) negatively influence solution viscosity
due to strong hydrogen bonding and secondary carbamates need specific catalysis to
react with amino resins.</p><p num="0006">US 4,820,830 relates to hydroxyalkyl carbamates prepared by reacting cyclic
carbonates with diamines. Such hydroxyalkyl carbamates have many times limited
solubility and compatibility due to high secondary carbamate content. US 4,883,854
describes polyurethanes derived from hydroxyalkyl carbamates which are synthesized
from polyamines with at least two amine groups and cyclic carbonates. There is no
teaching on the reaction products of mono secondary amines with cyclic carbonates to
form the hydroxyl functional carbamates and the further use in the synthesis of
branched hydroxyl functional oligomers with controlled molecular weight
distribution. US 4,542,173 relates to self-crosslinkable binders containing at least to
hydroxyalkyl carbamate groups with a secondary carbamate group. US 5,175,231
relates to urethane oligomers with an amine functional group.</p><p num="0007">It is therefore desirable to find a method for preparing highly branched hydroxy
functional urethane adducts with a controlled molecular weight distribution and
essentially free from primary carbamate and urea groups. Such compounds would
provide coating compositions with a good combination of low solution viscosity (low
VOC), excellent chemical resistance, mechanical properties and outdoor durability. </p><heading><b><i><u style="single">Summary of the Invention</u></i></b></heading><p num="0008">Hydroxy functional urethane compounds comprising the reaction product of:

5-ring carbonate. Examples of 5-ring carbonates include ethylene carbonate,
propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate and glycerine carbonate. Examples of
secondary amines are alkyl, benzyl and cycloalkyl-ethanolamines and alkyl-propanol
amines as methyl ethanolamine, n-butyl aminoethanol, hexyl aminoethanol, benzyl
aminoethanol, cyclohexyl aminoethanol, methyl propanolamine, n-butyl
propanolamine, cyclohexyl propanolamine and benzyl propanolamine.</p><p num="0013">Such compounds are typically prepared by reaction of cyclic oxides as ethyleneoxide
or propyleneoxide with a primary amine. Examples of bis-hydroxyl functional
secondary amines are diethanolamine and diisopropanolamine. Secondary amines can
also be prepared from the reaction of primary amines with other cyclic three-member
oxides as n-butyleneoxide, cyclohexeneoxide, i-butyleneoxide and derivatives as
monoepoxy ethers and monoepoxy esters. Examples of monoepoxy esters are
glycidyl esters of mono acids as acetic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, pivalic acid,
versatic acid and C9 and C10 alpha branched fatty acids available from Shell.
Examples of monoepoxy ethers are glycidyl ethers of phenyl, n-butyl, lauryl, t-butylphenyl
and cyclohexyl.</p><p num="0014">The reaction of the secondary amine can be performed at room temperature up to
200°C, preferably between 40°C and 150°C. Solvents can eventually be used in this
reaction. Examples of solvents are alcohols, ketones, esters, amides, and aliphatic or
aromatic hydrocarbons. Typical examples are methanol, n-butanol, s-butanol, t-butanol,
n-propanol, i-propanol, n-hexanol, 2-ethyl hexanol, laurylalcohol, acetone,
methyl ethyl ketone, isobutyl methyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, toluene, xylene,
Solvesso® 100, Solvesso® 150, Solvesso® 200 (trade name of Exxon Corporation),
heptane, mineral spirits, n-methyl pyrrolidone, ethylacetate, n-butylacetate, i-butylacetate, 
t-butylacetate, 2-ethyl hexylacetate, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol,
propylene glycol n-butyl ether, propylene glycol n-butyl ether acetate, diethylene
glycol and diethyleneglycol diacetate.</p><p num="0015">Catalysts can be used in the synthesis of the tertiary carbamate intermediate as e.g., tin
and zinc salts (dibutyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin oxide, tin octoate, zinc octoate), bases
(potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide) and acids (acetic
acid, toluene sulfonic acid, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, phenyl acid phosphate).</p><p num="0016">In a next step, the hydroxyl functional tertiary carbamate intermediate is reacted with
a compound having at least two isocyanate groups. Example of such compounds are
diisocyanates as e.g., hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, toluene
diisocyanate, 3,3',5-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, meta and para tetramethyl
xylene diisocyanate, 4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (Desmodur® W from
Bayer AG) and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate. Polyfunctional isocyanates
derived from the diisocyanates can also be used as e.g., the cyclotrimer of isophorone
diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate, the biuret of hexamethylene
diisocyanate, the uretdion dimer of hexamethylene diisocyanate (i.e., the 4 ring
dimerization product of NCO with NCO), the adducts of polyols (e.g., trimethylol
propane) with an excess of diisocyanate.</p><p num="0017">A polyisocyanate can also be formed by reaction of a diisocyanate excess with a
compound having at least two reactive groups versus the isocyanate, preferably
having at least two hydroxyl groups. Such compounds can be diols or polyols derived
from polyesters, polycarbonates, polyethers, polyacrylics and polyisocyanates.</p><p num="0018">The novel urethanes which are the final reaction products of the tertiary carbamate
intermediate with the polyisocyanates can be used in paint compositions in which the
reaction product is crosslinked with an amino resin or polyisocyanate which can be
blocked or unblocked. It has been found that cured films from above paint
compositions have good chemical resistance and mechanical properties like hardness,
flexibility, scratch and chip resistance. Specifically, automotive clearcoats made with
these novel urethanes demonstrate significant improvements in acid etch and scratch
resistance. In one pack clearcoats the crosslinkers are typically melamine
formaldehyde adducts etherified with alcohols as methanol, isobutanol or n-butanol.
Blocked polyisocyanates can also be used as e.g., methylethyl ketoxime or dimethyl
pyrazole blocked trimers of hexamethylene diisocyanate or isophorone diisocyanate.
In such one pack clearcoats, the curing temperature is above 80°C typically between
100°C and 180°C. The clearcoats may contain additives to improve properties as e.g.,
application (sagging), flow, wetting, durability. Other polymers can be used in the 
clearcoats to improve specific properties which include acrylics, polyesters, vinyls,
polyurethanes, polycarbonates, alkyds and polysilanes.</p><p num="0019">Catalysts can be added to speed-up the curing reaction as e.g. toluene sulfonic acid,
phenyl acid phosphate, dibutyl tin dilaurate. Other one pack automotive paint
compositions include primers, basecoats and pigmented topcoats. Those
compositions contain regular pigments and extenders which can be organic or
inorganic. Examples of pigments include titanium dioxide, barium sulfate, talc,
aluminum silicate, phtalocyanines, quinacridones, carbon black, aluminum flakes,
mica flakes and lead chromate. In refinish applications, the curing temperature of the
final coating is ambient up to 80°C maximum. The reaction products of the present
invention can be used is two pack coatings in which the crosslinker is added to the
paint containing the reaction product prior to application. Typical crosslinkers used in
two component paints are polyisocyanates. Specific examples are the biuret and
cyclotrimer of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate.</p><p num="0020">Coating compositions can be coated on the article by any number of techniques well-known
in the art. These include, for example, spray coating, dip coating, roll coating,
curtain coating and the like. For automotive body panels, spray coating is preferred.
The substrate can be any substrate onto which a coating formulation can be applied
and cured. Preferably the substrate is a metallic or polymeric panel suitable as an
automotive body panel.</p><heading><b><i><u style="single">Examples</u></i></b></heading><p num="0021">The invention is further described in the following examples. Comparative examples
demonstrate the difference from the prior art. Molecular weights are determined by
gel permeation chromatography using polystyrene as standards. Percent solids is
determined gravimetrically by the weight difference of the sample after drying in an
oven for 1 hour at 105°C. Amine and acid values are determined by titration and
viscosity by Gardner-Holdt tubes.</p><heading><b>Examples 1-3:</b> synthesis of tris hydroxyl functional urethane intermediate with
