In particular, the invention relates to a liquid crystal composition having a negative dielectric anisotropy, and a device having an IPS (in-plane switching) mode or a VA (vertical alignment) mode containing the composition.</p><p num="p0002">On a liquid crystal display device, classification based on an operating mode of liquid crystals includes phase change (PC), twisted nematic (TN), super twisted nematic (STN), electrically controlled birefringence (ECB), optically compensated bend (OCB), in-plane switching (IPS), vertical alignment (VA), and so forth. Classification based on a driving mode includes a passive matrix (PM) and an active matrix (AM). PM is further classified into static, multiplex and so forth, and AM is classified into a thin film transistor (TFT), a metal insular metal (MIM) and so forth. TFT is further classified into amorphous silicon, polycrystal silicon, and continuous grain silicon. The polycrystal silicon is classified into a high temperature type and a low temperature type according to a production process. Classification based on a light source includes a reflection type utilizing natural light, a transmission type utilizing a backlight, and a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> semi-transmission type utilizing both natural light and a backlight.</p><p num="p0003">These devices contain a liquid crystal composition having suitable characteristics. General characteristics of the composition should be improved to obtain an AM device having good general characteristics. Table 1 below summarizes the relationship between the general characteristics of the composition and the AM device. The general characteristics of the composition will be explained further based on a commercially available AM device. The temperature range of a nematic phase relates to the temperature range, in which the device can be used. The desirable maximum temperature of a nematic phase is 70°C or more, and a desirable minimum temperature of a nematic phase is -20°C or less. The viscosity of the composition relates to the response time of the device. A short response time is desirable for displaying a moving image. Accordingly, a small viscosity of the composition is desirable. A small viscosity at a low temperature is more desirable.

Devices having a VA mode, an IPS mode, and so forth utilize electrically controlled birefringence. In order to maximize a contrast ratio of a device having a VA mode, an IPS mode, and so forth, a product (Δn•d) of the optical anisotropy (Δn) of the composition and the cell gap (d) of the device is designed to be a constant value. Examples of the value include from 0.30 to 0.35 µm (VA mode) and from 0.20 to 0.30 µm (IPS mode). Since the cell gap (d) is generally from 3 to 6 µm, the optical anisotropy of the composition is generally from 0.05 to 0.11. A large dielectric anisotropy of the composition contributes to a small driving voltage of the device. Accordingly, a large dielectric anisotropy is desirable. A large specific resistance of the composition contributes to a large voltage holding ratio and a large contrast ratio of the device. Accordingly, a composition having a large specific resistance is desirable at room temperature and also at a high temperature in the initial stage. A composition having a large specific resistance is desirable at room temperature and also at a high temperature after use for a long period of time. Since an ultraviolet ray is used on producing a device, a composition having a large specific resistance is desirable at room temperature and also at a high temperature after irradiation with an ultraviolet ray.</p><p num="p0005">A composition having a positive dielectric anisotropy<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> is used in an AM device having a TN mode. On the other hand, a composition having a negative dielectric anisotropy is used in an AM device having a VA mode.

The liquid crystal composition of the invention or the liquid crystal display device of the invention may occasionally be expressed simply as "the composition" or "the device", respectively. A liquid crystal display device is a generic term for a liquid crystal display panel and a liquid crystal display module.

At least one compound selected from a group of compounds represented by formula (1) may be abbreviated to "the compound (1)". The other formulas are applied with the same rule.</p><p num="p0009">The term "at least one compound selected from compounds represented by formulas (1) and (2)" has three meanings, i.e., a case where a compound is selected only from compounds represented by formula (1), a case where a compound is selected only from compounds represented by formula (2), and a case where a compound is selected from compounds represented by formulas (1) and (2). The other formulas are applied with the same rule.</p><p num="p0010">The term "essentially" means that the composition is constituted only by liquid crystal compounds selected from the compounds (1) to (4), so that the composition may further contain additives and impurities, and so forth. Possible additives include for example an optically active compound, or coloring matter.</p><p num="p0011">In the case where the first component is a single compound, the term "the amount of the first component" means the amount of the compound. In the case where the first component includes two or more compounds, it means the total amount of the compounds constituting the first component. The other<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> components are applied with the same rule.</p><p num="p0012">The term "at least one compound selected from compounds represented by formula (2-2) as the second component" means that the second component is selected only from formula (2-2), and the second component does not contain other compounds than formula (2-2).

"A specific resistance is large" means that the composition has a large specific resistance at room temperature and also at a high temperature in the initial stage, the composition has a large specific resistance at room temperature and also at a high temperature even after it has been used for a long time, and the composition has a large specific resistance at room temperature and also at a high temperature even after it is irradiated with an ultraviolet ray. "A voltage holding ratio is large" means that an device has a large voltage holding ratio at room temperature and also at a high temperature in the initial stage, the device has a large voltage holding ratio at room temperature and also at a high temperature even after it has been used for a long time, and the device has a large voltage holding ratio at room temperature and also at a high temperature even after it is<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> irradiated with an ultraviolet ray. In the descriptions herein, the characteristics of the composition such as the optical anisotropy and so forth are values measured in the methods disclosed in Examples.

One aspect of the invention is to provide, for example, a liquid crystal composition properly balanced regarding many characteristics. Another aspect of the invention is to provide a liquid crystal display device, for example, containing such a composition and having a large voltage holding ratio. A further aspect of the invention is to provide an AM device, for example, containing a composition with a minimum temperature of a nematic phase of -30°C or less, a maximum temperature of a nematic phase of 100°C or more, a small viscosity, an optical anisotropy ranging from 0.05 to 0.11 and a dielectric anisotropy ranging from -6.5<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> to -2.0, and being suitable, for example, for a VA mode, an IPS mode and so forth.</p><p num="p0015">The invention concerns a liquid crystal composition having a negative dielectric anisotropy and containing at least one compound selected from a group of compounds represented by formula (1) as a first component, at least one compound selected from a group of compounds represented by formula (2) as a second component, at least one compound selected from a group of compounds represented by formula (3) as a third component, and at least one compound selected from a group of compounds represented by formula (4) as a fourth component.

A lower limit of a temperature range of a nematic phase may be abbreviated to "a minimum temperature".</p><p num="p0056">Optical anisotropy (Δn; measured at 25°C): Measurement was carried out with an Abbe refractometer mounting a polarizing plate on an ocular using a light at a wavelength of 589 nanometers. The surface of a main prism was rubbed in one direction, and then a sample was dropped on the main prism. Refractive index n∥ was measured when the direction of a polarized light was parallel to that of the rubbing.<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> Refractive index n⊥ was measured when the direction of a polarized light was perpendicular to that of the rubbing. A value of optical anisotropy was calculated from the equation; Δn = n∥- n⊥.</p><p num="p0057">Dielectric anisotropy (Δε; measured at 25°C) : A sample having a nematic phase was put in a VA device having a distance between two glass substrates (cell gap) of 4 micrometers with an antiparallel rubbing direction, and the device was sealed with an UV curable adhesive. Sine waves (10 volts, 1 kilohertz) were impressed onto the device, and a dielectric constant (ε∥) that is parallel to a liquid crystal molecule was measured after 2 seconds. A sample was put in a TN device having a distance between two glass substrates (all gap) of a micrometers and a twist angle of 80°. Sine waves (0.5 volts, 1 kilohertz) were impressed onto the device, and a dielectric constant (ε⊥) that is perpendicular to a liquid crystal molecule was measured after 2 seconds. A value of a dielectric anisotropy was calculated from the equation; Δε = ε∥ - ε⊥.</p><p num="p0058">Frequency dependency of dielectric anisotropy (Δε-f; measured at -20°C): Dielectric anisotropy at -20°C was measured by the measurement method for dielectric anisotropy described above. The frequency of the sine wave was 100 Hz and 100 kHz, and ε∥ or ε⊥ was measured after 6 seconds from impressing a voltage. Frequency dependency of dielectric anisotropy was a value obtained by subtracting a dielectric<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> anisotropy measured at 100 kHz from a dielectric anisotropy measured at 100 Hz. It was determined that when the value was as close as to zero, frequency dependency of dielectric anisotropy was small, that is, the sample was excellent in frequency dependency of dielectric anisotropy. Frequency dependency of dielectric anisotropy may be abbreviated to "frequency dependency".</p><p num="p0059">Threshold voltage (Vth; measured at 25°C; V): Measurement was carried out with LCD Evaluation System Model LCD-5100 made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. Light source is a halogen lamp. A sample was poured into a VA device of a normally black mode, in which a cell gap between two glass plates was 4 micrometers with an antiparallel rubbing direction, and the device was sealed with an UV curable adhesive. Voltage to be impressed onto the device (70 Hz, rectangular waves) was stepwise increased by 0.02 volt starting from zero volt up to 20 volts. During the stepwise increasing, a light was irradiated to the device in a perpendicular direction, and an amount of the light passing through the device was measured. Voltage-transmission curve was prepared, in which a maximum amount of a light corresponded to 100% transmittance, a minimum amount of a light corresponded to 0% transmittance. Threshold voltage is a value at 10% transmittance.</p><p num="p0060">Temperature dependency of threshold voltage (Vth-T; V): Threshold voltage was measured at 20°C and 70°C by the<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> measurement method for threshold voltage described above. Temperature dependency of threshold voltage was a value obtained by subtracting a threshold voltage measured at 70°C from a threshold voltage measured at 20°C. It was determined that when the value was as close as to zero, temperature dependency of threshold voltage was small, that is, the sample was excellent in temperature dependency of threshold voltage. Temperature dependency of threshold voltage may be abbreviated to "temperature dependency".</p><p num="p0061">Voltage holding ratio (VHR; measured at 25°C and 100°C; %): A TN device used for measurement has a polyimide-alignment film and the cell gap between two glass plates is 4.5 micrometers. A sample was poured into the device, and then the device was sealed with an adhesive which is polymerized by the irradiation of ultraviolet light. The TN device was impressed and charged with pulse voltage (60 microseconds at 5 volts). Decreasing voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds with High Speed Voltmeter and the area A between a voltage curve and a horizontal axis in a unit cycle was obtained. The area B was an area without decreasing. Voltage holding ratio is a percentage of the area A to the area B. A voltage holding ratio obtained at 25°C was expressed as VHR-1. A voltage holding ratio obtained at 100°C was expressed as VHR-2. Next, this TN device was heated at 100°C for 250 hours. Separately, this TN device was irradiated with an<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> ultraviolet ray (UV). The irradiation condition was a high-pressure mercury lamp (USH-500D, produced by Ushio, Inc., 500 W) as an UV light source, a distance between the light source and the device of 20 cm, and an irradiation time of 20 minutes. VHR-3 is a voltage holding ratio measured at 25°C after heating. VHR-4 is a voltage holding ratio measured at 100°C after heating. VHR-5 is a voltage holding ratio measured at 25°C after irradiation with UV. VHR-6 is a voltage holding ratio measured at 100°C after irradiation with UV. VHR-1 and VHR-2 correspond to evaluation of a device at the initial stage. VHR-3 and VHR-4 correspond to evaluation of a device after it has been used for a long time. VHR-5 and VHR-6 correspond to evaluation of light stability of a device.</p><p num="p0062">Response time (τ; measured at 25°C; millisecond): Measurement was carried out with LCD Evaluation System Model LCD-5100 made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. Light source is a halogen lamp. Low-pass filter was set at 5 kilohertz. A sample was poured into a VA device of a normally black mode, in which a cell gap between two glass plates was 4 micrometers with an antiparallel rubbing direction, and the device was sealed with an UV curable adhesive. Rectangle waves (70 Hertz, a voltage where a transmission of 100% was obtained in the measurement of threshold voltage, 0.5 seconds) was impressed to the device. During impressing, a light was irradiated to the device in a perpendicular direction, and an amount of the<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> light passing through the device was measured. A maximum amount of a light corresponds to 100% transmittance, and a minimum amount of a light corresponds to 0% transmission. Fall time (τf) is a period of time required for the change in transmittance from 100% to 0%. Response time is the fall time.</p><p num="p0063">Rotation viscosity (γ1; measured at 25°C; mPa·s): Rotation viscosity was measured according to the method disclosed in <nplcit id="ncit0005" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>M. Imai, et al., Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals, vol. 259, p. 37 (1995</text></nplcit>). A sample was placed in VA device of a normally black mode, in which a cell gap between two glass plates was 4 micrometers with an antiparallel rubbing direction, and the device was sealed with an UV curable adhesive. The VA device was impressed with a voltage in a range of from 10 V to 20 V stepwise by 1 V. After a period of 0.2 second with no impress of voltage, voltage impress was repeated with only one rectangular wave (rectangular pulse of 0.2 second) and application of no voltage (2 seconds). A peak current and a peak time of a transient current generated by the voltage impress were measured. Rotation viscosity was obtained from the measured values and the calculating equation (8) in the literature by M. Imai, et al. As the dielectric anisotropy necessary for the calculation, the value measured by the measuring method of dielectric anisotropy described above was used.</p><p num="p0064">Gas chromatographic Analysis: Gas Chromatograph Model<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> GC-14B made by Shimadzu was used for measurement. Carrier gas is helium (2 milliliters per minute). An evaporator and a detector (FID) were set up at 280°C and 300°C, respectively. Capillary column DB-1 (length 30 meters, bore 0.32 millimeters, film thickness 0.25 micrometers, dimethylpolysiloxane as stationary phase, no polarity) made by Agilent Technologies, Inc. was used for the separation of the component compound. After the column had been kept at 200°C for 2 minutes, it was further heated to 280°C at the rate of 5°C per minute. A sample was prepared into an acetone solution (0.1% by weight), and 1 microliter of the solution was injected into the evaporator. The recorder used was Chromatopac Model C-R5A made by Shimadzu or its equivalent. Gas chromatogram obtained showed a retention time of a peak and a peak area corresponding to the component compound.</p><p num="p0065">Solvents for diluting the sample may also be chloroform, hexane, and so forth. The following capillary columns may also be used: HP-1 made by Agilent Technologies Inc. (length 30 meters, bore 0.32 millimeters, film thickness 0.25 micrometers), Rtx-1 made by Restek Corporation (length 30 meters, bore 0.32 millimeters, film thickness 0.25 micrometers), and BP-1 made by SGE International Pty. Ltd. (length 30 meters, bore 0.32 millimeters, film thickness 0.25 micrometers). In order to prevent compound peaks from overlapping, a capillary column CBP1-M50-025 (length 50 meters,<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> bore 0.25 millimeters, film thickness 0.25 micrometers) made by Shimadzu Corporation may be used. An area ratio of each peak in the gas chromatogram corresponds to a ratio of the component compound. Percentage by weight of the component compound is not completely identical to an area ratio of each peak. According to the invention, however, percentage by weight of the component compound may be regarded to be identical to an area ratio of each peak, when these capillary columns are used. This is because there is no significant difference in correction efficient of component compounds.</p><heading>Comparative Example 1</heading><p num="p0066">Example 1 was chosen from the compositions disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0009" dnum="JPH10176167A" status="new"><text>JP H10-176167 A / 1998</text></patcit>.
