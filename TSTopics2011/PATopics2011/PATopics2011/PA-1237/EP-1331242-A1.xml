particularly, to a moldable elastomeric intumescent composition.</p><heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0002">Various methods exist for the protection of persons and property
against fire. Among these methods is the use of flame retardant materials,
which generally comprise intumescent composite compounds that swell and
form ceramic-like sponges when exposed to the high temperatures generally
associated with fires. Typically, intumescent materials are incorporated into
coatings or paints and are most often formed into mat-like structures that may
be placed between a high fire risk apparatus and an apparatus or area for which
fire protection is desired.</p><p num="0003">Intumescent coatings are generally used on the wall surfaces of
buildings, ships, aircraft, motor vehicles, or other vessels intended for human
occupancy and which are susceptible to fires. The nature of the intumescent
coating allows its thickness to be kept at a minimum until it is activated by high
temperatures at which point the coating expands. Such intumescent coatings
contain film-forming resins that, upon being subjected to high temperatures,
undergo molecular changes that result in corresponding changes in physical
properties such as a reduced ability to conduct heat. The intumescent coatings
also contain ingredients that will react upon heating to generate gases and form
an incombustible or low combustible residue, e.g., char. The expelled gases
expand the residue or char into a foam having thermal insulating properties. In
many instances a considerable portion of the char produced is a carbon material;
the reaction product formed by the dehydration of a polyhydric substance such
as a polyalcohol. The char forming reactions of the ingredients occur within the
intumescent coating so that when the coating film is heated to beyond a specific 
elevated temperature, intumescent additives, such as polyhydric alcohol,
ammonium hydrogen phosphate and hydrated magnesia, are decomposed,
thereby generating water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and/or other heat absorbing
gases that do not readily support combustion. However, although intumescent
coatings are readily available, their application to a surface requires a lengthy
and complicated process. Often times, a primer is required to promote adhesion
to the surface. In addition, the primer and/or intumescent coating require a
substantial drying time, sometimes as long as many hours. When these primed
intumescent coatings are exposed to fire and intumesce, the coatings transform
into a weak sponge that cannot withstand raging drafts and thermal expansion
forces that occur as a result of the fire. Oftentimes as a result, the intumescent
coating provides only limited protection for a short period of time.</p><p num="0004">Intumescent mat-like structures are often used in place of coatings to
avoid such problems associated with such intumescent coatings. Typically in
these flexible intumescent mat-like structures, multiple layers of fire resistant
materials having intumescent materials located therebetween form a flexible
wrap that provides a consistent and effective fire protection system when the
intumescent materials expand. Although such flexible mat-like structures can
be manufactured to have sufficient flexibility to conform to the shape of an
object to be protected (e.g., conduits, electrical cable, etc.), the mat-like
structures require additional hardware or an adhesive in order to be held into
place.</p><p num="0005">Therefore, there exists a need for a moldable elastomeric intumescent
thermoplastic material having intumescent properties and capable of
conforming to objects without the use of adhesives or their equivalents.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0006">A mixture for making a moldable intumescent elastomeric

<sl><li>Figure 1 is a perspective view of an intumescent flammability test
apparatus used for measuring the efficiency of moldable intumescent composite
materials of the present invention; and</li><li>Figure 2 is a graph depicting temperature versus time at different
locations on a steel plate protected by the moldable intumescent thermoplastic
composition.</li></sl></p><heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p num="0017">An elastomeric intumescent material generally comprises a mixture of
chlorinated polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, plasticizer, char-forming
materials, phosphate based foaming agent, intumescing materials, antioxidants,
flame retardant materials and graphite. However, glass in any form such as
fibers, fibrils, particles and the like, tends to diminish the performance of the
composite material's elastomeric properties, and is not included. The mixture
combines elastomeric behavior with intumescence, which produces a material
that is conformable to various shapes, elastic to allow stretching, deformable to
absorb energy. </p><p num="0018">The elastomeric intumescent material provides intumescent molding
compositions that can be extruded, blow molded, injection molded,
compression molded or otherwise suitably molded and shaped to a desired
geometry or configuration by thermal processes. In some applications, the
molded part may be intended to serve primarily as a heat or fire barrier. In
other applications, the material will coat a flexible article such as a wire. More
often, it will also serve another functional purpose and serve incidentally as a
heat or fire barrier. For example, the elastomer intumescent composition can be
formed as a sheet or molded, e.g., into a cover, and heated and pressed,
laminated, or bonded to a reinforcing material such as steel, plastic, carbon,
wood, combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing, and the like, to
form a composite material. In either case, the invention provides a moldable
material mixture that can be formed into a molded product in a suitable
manufacturing facility and transported for efficient handling at an automobile
assembly line or at a construction site or the like. Thus, the subject composition
facilitates efficient manufacture and assembly and provides robust physical and
fire-resistant properties in use.</p><p num="0019">The values in Table 1 opposite each ingredient are parts by weight,
and the numbers for each moldable composition mixture total 100. Table 1
illustrates several formulations of a moldable elastomeric intumescent
composition in which a suitable high-density polyethylene and a suitable
chlorinated polyethylene are used together to form a thermoplastic elastomeric-based
composition. The "range" column also discloses a family of suitable
compositions in which the CPE is used in combination or alone. Thus, CPE is
present in an amount sufficient to form a suitable moldable composition and
molded product. As further illustrated in the formulations of Table 1, it will be
shown that when graphite and/or expandable graphite is substituted for an
ammonia producing compound, the degree of intumescence and fire shielding
properties of the composition improves, and the composition does not emit
ammonia gas when heated. <tables><table><tgroup cols="7"><tbody><row><entry align="center" namest="1">INGREDIENT</entry><entry nameend="7" align="center" namest="2">SAMPLE</entry></row><row><entry align="center"/><entry align="center">Sample 1</entry><entry align="center">Sample 2</entry><entry align="center">Sample 3</entry><entry align="center">Sample 4</entry><entry align="center">Sample 5</entry><entry align="center">Sample 6</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Chlorinated polyethylene</entry><entry align="center">55</entry><entry align="center">50</entry><entry align="center">45</entry><entry align="center">45</entry><entry align="center">50</entry><entry align="center">50</entry></row><row><entry align="left">High Density Polyethylene</entry><entry align="center">-</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">10</entry><entry align="center">10</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Chlorowax</entry><entry align="center">7</entry><entry align="center">7</entry><entry align="center">7</entry><entry align="center">7</entry><entry align="center">7</entry><entry align="center">7</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Phosphate-based foaming agent</entry><entry align="center">8</entry><entry align="center">8</entry><entry align="center">8</entry><entry align="center">8</entry><entry align="center">-</entry><entry align="center">4</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Hydrated magnesium oxide</entry><entry align="center">15</entry><entry align="center">15</entry><entry align="center">15</entry><entry align="center">15</entry><entry align="center">15</entry><entry align="center">15</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Distearyl-Thiopropionate</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Hindered Phenol</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry><entry align="center">0.5</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Antimony Oxide</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">2</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Pentaerythritol</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry><entry align="center">5</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Graphite</entry><entry align="center">4</entry><entry align="center">4</entry><entry align="center">4</entry><entry align="center">-</entry><entry align="center">-</entry><entry align="center">-</entry></row><row><entry align="left">Graphite (expandable)</entry><entry align="center">-</entry><entry align="center">-</entry><entry align="center">-</entry><entry align="center">4</entry><entry align="center">12</entry><entry align="center">11</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p num="0020">The polyethylene constituent of the formulations has a density in the
range of 0.940 to 0.970 g/cm3. Such materials are produced using suitable
known catalysts at a relatively low pressure of ethylene. Such high-density
polyethylenes are available with molecular weight ranging from about 10,000
(usually waxes) to ultra high molecular weight HDPE (UHMW--HDPE) of
several millions. Wide variation of branching and density are also available.</p><p num="0021">Many grades of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) can be used in this
invention depending on the application and the method of processing. High
molecular weight/high melt viscosity grades are used for blow molding
applications. Low melt viscosity grades are preferred for injection molding.
Extrusion is normally performed using intermediate melt viscosities. High-density
polyethylene by itself could be formulated into an intumescent material;
however, it will not be elastomeric. </p><p num="0022">Chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), suitably with about 36 to 42% by
weight chlorine, is preferably combined with HDPE in accordance with the
invention at different ratios to produce moldable intumescent thermoplastic
elastomer grades with varying degrees of hardness. CPE can also be formulated
into an intumescent material without HDPE but only through the addition of a
small concentration of curing agents. The intumescent composition formed will
be highly elastomeric and will act as an efficient noise and vibration isolator,
especially if the material is foamed during processing. A suitable commercial
example of CPE is TYRIN® 3615P available from DuPont Dow Elastomers
Co., Midland, Michigan, containing 36% by weight chlorine and having a
residual degree of crystallinity of less than 2 percent.</p><p num="0023">Generally, the amount of CPE to HDPE in the formulation is a ratio of
greater than 4:1, wherein the amount of CPE and HDPE combined is about 40
to about 60 parts by weight based on the total weight of the formulation. A
ratio of less than 4:1 of CPE to HDPE produces a composition lacking the
desired elastomeric quality. Preferably, the amount of CPE present is about 45
to about 55 parts by weight based on the total weight of the formulation, and not
lower than about 45 parts by weight. The amount of HDPE present is up to
about 15 parts by weight, and about 5 to about 10 parts by weight based on the
total weight of the formulation. Preferably, the amount of HDPE is present at
about 5 to about 10 parts by weight based on the total weight of the formulation.</p><p num="0024">Chlorowax, or other suitable plasticizer such as PAROIL 145,
commercially available from Dover Corporation, Industrial Division, Canada, is
employed when a plasticizer is desired or required. The plasticizer's presence
in the formulation will improve low temperature properties of the intumescent
CPE/HDPE thermoplastic elastomer mixture. An added advantage of a
plasticizer is that it contributes to the char formation during burning of the
intumescent material. The amount of plasticizer, or other suitable plasticizer,
present in the formulation is about 5 to about 10 parts by weight based on the
total weight of the formulation.</p><p num="0025">The presence of at least one gas generating compound such as
ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (or ammonium polyphosphate) promotes 
char formation, leads to a strong structure of the intumescent material structure
after burning, and helps in the intumescence process by emitting ammonia gas
during burning. As the ammonia gas diffuses through the elastomeric
intumescent composition, the material softens and the diffusion causes air
pockets to form, making the material become porous. The increased porosity of
the material improves its thermal insulation characteristics. The amount of the
gas generating compound present in the formulation is up to about 10 parts by
weight based on the total weight of the composition. Preferably, the gas
generating compound is present at about 1 to about 8 parts by weight based on
the total weight of the formulation. A suitable foaming agent is PHOSCHECK
P/30, an ammonium polyphosphate, commercially available from Monsanto
Company, St. Louis, Missouri.</p><p num="0026">At least one or more water emitting substances such as hydrated
alumina, hydrated magnesia, magnesium oxide, metal carbonates, bicarbonates,
azides and other nitrogen containing compounds, mixtures thereof, and the like,
are included to emit gases during burning, and act to induce intumescence and
cool down the fire. In addition, magnesium oxide acts as a dehydrochlorination
stabilizer, that is, the magnesium oxide has a tendency to absorb hydrochloric
acid gas that is produced and evolved during the thermal decomposition of the
CPE. The amount of such water emitting substances present in the formulation
is about 10 to about 20 parts by weight based on the total weight of the
formulation. Preferably, one or more water emitting substances, such as
hydrated magnesium oxide, or hydrated magnesium oxide and magnesium
hydroxide, are present at levels of less than or about 15 parts by weight based
on the total weight of the formulation. A suitable commercial example of
hydrated alumina is available as MARTINAL OL-104C from Lonza, Inc., Fair
Lawn, New Jersey, while a suitable magnesia is commercially available as
MAGSHIELD 98 from Martin Marietta, Baltimore, Maryland, among other
sources.</p><p num="0027">Pentaerythritol as monomolecular and/or bimolecular forms is a very
effective char former. In addition, other suitable char formers include other
polyhydric alcohols, as well as carbohydrates, starch and mixtures thereof. 
Such char formers are present in the formulation at about 3 to about 10 parts by
weight based on the total weight of the formulation. One suitable commercial
example of a char formation agent is a blend of monopentaerythritol and
dipentaerythritol (bimolecular form of pentaerythritol), which is commercially
available as PERSTORP PE from Perstorp Compounds, Inc., Florence,
Massachusetts.</p><p num="0028">Both the thio-based antioxidants, e.g., distearylthiodipropionate, and the
hindered phenol antioxidants are effective in stabilizing the intumescent
material against thermal oxidation, especially if used together as co-synergists.
Hindered phenols allow the addition of free radicals generated during polymer
oxidation and deactivate them to slow down the oxidation process, while sulfur
and amine compounds react in the termination step of the autocatalytic
oxidation of polymers, thus changing active free radicals to inactive
compounds, which slows down the oxidative degradation. The combination of
both compounds has been found to produce a synergistic effect. The amounts
of such stabilizers present in the formulation are about 0.25 to about 2 parts by
weight based on the total weight of the formulation. Preferably, the stabilizers
are present in equal amounts, the total amount being within the range of about
0.25 to about 2 parts by weight.</p><p num="0029">Distearylthiodipropionate is commercially available as DSDTP from
Witco Corporation, Greenwich, Connecticut, and the phenol is available as
WINGSTAY L from R.T. Vanderbilt, Norwalk, Connecticut. Other suitable
commercial examples include antioxidants based on hindered phenols, such as
Irganox 1010 commercially available from Ciba Geigy, or sulfur compounds,
such as Vanax A commercially available from R.T. Vanderbilt, or amine
containing compounds, such as Agerite White commercially available from
R.T. Vanderbilt.</p><p num="0030">The presence of antimony oxide is quite optional. This compound
provides added flame retardancy to the formulation by reacting with chlorinated
polyethylene and chlorowax to form antimony chloride. Antimony chloride
sublimes during fire and quenches free radicals in the gaseous phase to slow
down the burning process and reduce smoke when the elastomeric intumescent 
material burns. Other suitable materials that may reduce smoke include zinc
borate, cobalt and manganese organic compounds. When utilized, the amount
of antimony oxide, or other suitable flame retardant composition, e.g., zinc
borate, present in the formulation is about 1 to about 7 parts by weight based on
the total weight of the formulation. Preferably, antimony oxide is present at
about 2 to about 5 parts by weight based on the total weight of the formulation.</p><p num="0031">Graphite, mica, titanium dioxide, other suitable filler materials and
mixtures thereof, are added to the mixture for color, some reinforcement and to
enhance processing conditions. Expandable graphite, i.e., graphite containing
intercalated water, is effective in enhancing intumescence. The graphite
expands upon exposure to heat or fire, which improves intumescence, e.g.,
when used as a flame retardant material. The amount of filler materials,
including the expandable graphite, present in the formulation is about 2 to about
12 parts by weight based on the total amount of formulation. Preferably, the
amount of filler materials is greater than 10 parts by weight, or from about 4 to
about 12 parts by weight based on the total weight of the formulation. A
suitable graphite is Asbury A-60, commercially available from Asbury Carbons,
Asbury, New Jersey, and a suitable expandable graphite is Asbury Dxn 3579,
commercially available from Asbury Carbons, Asbury, New Jersey. As
illustrated in Table 1, and in the experimental data of Table 2, the ammonia
producing compound is substituted with graphite or expandable graphite to
produce an elastomeric intumescent composition having improved mechanical
properties, intumescence and fire shielding properties.</p><p num="0032">All of the components disclosed herein may be utilized in the form of
particles, fibers, powder, spheres, nanotubes, nanospheres, and the like, as well
as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing forms, can be
employed.</p><p num="0033">All of the formulations listed in Table 1 can be chemically cross-linked
using one or more curing agents. Suitable curing agents include but are
not limited to peroxide curing systems, sulfur curing systems, combinations
comprising at least one of the foregoing, and the like. Other co-curing agents
and/or accelerators can also be employed. For example, suitable peroxide 
curing systems include dicumyl peroxide, and an accelerator such as trimethylol
propane trimethacrylate. These agents improve the rigidity of the elastomeric
intumescent thermoplastic composition, especially upon exposure to fire. A
suitable commercial peroxide system includes dicumyl peroxide, which is
commercially available as DICUP 40KE from Hercules Inc., Wilmington,
Delaware, and TMPT, which is available as a liquid or adsorbed to the surface
of silica powder (Saret 500) from Sartomer Company, Inc., Exton,
Pennsylvania.</p><p num="0034">The amount of curing agent, and optionally accelerator or co-curing
agent, is based upon the desired properties of the material. Generally, the
amount of curing agent present in the composition can be about 0.001 to about
15 parts by weight based on the total weight of the polymers/elastomers or
composition, and the amount of co-curing agent or accelerator present can
optionally be about 0.001 to about 10 parts by weight based on the total weight
of the polymers/elastomers or composition. Preferably, about 0.05 to about 5
parts by weight of one or more curing agents can be present, and optionally
about 0.05 to about 3 parts by weight of one or more co-curing agents or
accelerators can be present.</p><p num="0035">For example, formulations comprising about 0.001 to about 5 parts by
weight of curing agent based on the total amount of polymers/elastomers in the
formulation, and optionally about 0.001 to about 3 parts by weight of
accelerator or co-curing agent based on the total amount of polymers/elastomers
in the formulation are considered lightly cross linked formulations which are
formed by conventional plastic techniques and exhibit improved properties
without sacrificing processability and the ability for recycling. In contrast,
formulations comprising about 5 to about 10 parts by weight of curing agent
based on the total amount of polymers/elastomers in the formulation, and
optionally about 3 to about 7 parts by weight of accelerator or co-curing agent
based on the total amount of polymers/elastomers in the formulation are
considered highly cross linked formulations which exhibit low compression set
but sacrifices the ability to reprocess, or recycle the polymers and elastomers by
melt flow process. Generally, cross-linked elastomers improve creep, 
compression set, tensile strength and modulus properties. As will be discussed
further below, cross-linking lowers ultimate elongation to which the material
can be extended prior to failure.</p><heading>Mixing of the Compositions</heading><p num="0036">The mixing of the formulations conducted on a laboratory scale was
achieved by several methods including mixing on a two-roll mill preheated
from about 50 to about 80°C, with about 65°C preferable. The components of
each formulation, excluding the intumescent materials, were added to the rolls
and shear mixed for about 2 to about 10 minutes, with about 5 minutes
preferable. The actual temperature of the mixture during mixing approached
about 150°C due to shearing. The intumescence ingredients were added next,
preferably in a fine powder form, and mixed with the initial components for
about 5 to about 10 minutes.</p><p num="0037">In alternative practices, formulations were also prepared by mixing in
a Brabender bowl, which is a small internal mixer, and in a large Banbury
internal mixer. In these practices, for example, the cavity of the Brabender bowl
is preheated to about 90 to about 150°C, with about 120°C preferred, prior
adding any components. A first batch of components such as chlorinated
polyethylene and high density polyethylene, hydrated magnesium oxide,
hydrated alumina, DSTDP, antimony oxide, pentaerythritol and chlorowax were
added to the bowl. The mixing speed of the bowl was then increased to and
maintained at about 120 revolutions per minute, and the components were
mixed for about one to about five minutes, with about 2 to about 3 minutes
preferred. During this first stage, the temperature of the cavity was not
permitted to rise above about 140°C. Additional components such as
ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, curing agent, and optional co-curing agent or
accelerator, were then added to the mixture and mixed. During this second
stage, the temperature of the cavity was not permitted to rise above 160°C in
order to prevent the degradation or decomposition of the component(s). The
mixture was then removed from the bowl and emptied onto a mill to further mix
and sheet out the material. A 2-pound Banbury internal mixer was also 
employed to produce the elastomer intumescent thermoplastic material using
process conditions similar to those employed with the Brabender bowl.</p><p num="0038">Yet another example of producing the formulations disclosed herein
employs a Brabender extruder. The effect of temperature and shear rate has
been investigated with this extruding device. The temperatures of the three
extruder barrel zones and the die were all varied between about 150 to about
175°C. Three settings of the screw speeds were investigated, that is, about 50,
about 75 and about 100 rpm. The length-to-diameter ratio of the screw was set
at 20 to 1, and the compression ratio was 1. As observed during the process, the
material extruded well and exhibited good mixing under all of the above-mentioned
process conditions.</p><p num="0039">Large scale or industrial size/grade batches may be prepared using a
twin screw Buss kneader or a large Banbury internal mixer, i.e., greater than 2-pounds.
One skilled in the art can adjust the temperature conditions and shear
rates based upon the conditions employed in laboratory scale production to
achieve the desired industrial size/grade elastomeric intumescent thermoplastic
material.</p><heading>Processing of the Composition</heading><p num="0040">Molding of the composition was accomplished by compression
molding, injection molding, vacuum forming, blow molding, and the like.
Standard dumbbells and sample sheets measuring 50 millimeters (mm) gauge in
length by a 6.25 mm in width by 2 mm in thickness of each formulation were
injection molded, and die cut from a compression molded slab. Standard heat
deflection bars measuring 127 mm by 152 mm by 2.75 mm were also prepared
by injection molding.</p><p num="0041">The tensile properties of the formulations listed in Table 1 are
presented in Table 2. The properties measures were tensile strength, modulus at
100% strain, strain at break, and tear strength. In addition to testing each
formulation's mechanical properties, two fire shielding characteristics are also

of each formulation sample were obtained using procedures outlined in ASTM
D624. The flexural properties (Modulus @ 100% strain) were determined per
ASTM D790 procedures. The test results are shown in Table 2. In addition, the
tension set (not shown) was determined for Sample 1. Sample 1 exhibited a
tension set of about zero after being stretched to 100% elongation when
measured on the sample (50 mm x 6.25 mm x 2 mm) according to ASTM D412
procedures. All of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)

resisting the spread of flame from a fire source and shielding articles protected
by the intumescent materials from high temperature rise. The characteristics or
property of intumescence efficiency is measured by a procedure using an
apparatus described below.</p><p num="0044">All of the formulations illustrated in this specification have been tested
as intumescent compositions to be used for resisting the spread of a flame from
a fire source and curtailing temperature rise. The characteristic or property of
Intumescence Efficiency as ascribed to moldings of the disclosed formulations
were determined in an apparatus and by a practice as follows. When reference is
made to such property in this specification or claims, it is intended that the
property be determined utilizing such an apparatus or the equivalent and such
practices.</p><p num="0045">The Intumescence Efficiency test apparatus is shown in Figure 1.
Apparatus 10 included a three-wall steel chamber comprising left sidewall 12,
back wall 14 and right side wall 16. Each wall was a steel plate 229 mm high,
127 mm wide and 1 mm thick. The plates were joined at their edges as shown
in Figure 1 to form a generally square-shaped (in cross section) chamber with
an open front.</p><p num="0046">A 152 mm by 152 mm by 1 mm thick steel plate adapted to be placed
on top of walls 12, 14 and 16 was employed as a roof member 18. During a
test, the roof member 18 carried affixed to its lower surface an above-described
molded sample sheet 20 of a formulation of Table 1 to be tested for
Intumescence Efficiency. Note that the thickness of 2.75 mm of the test
specimen (as well as its composition) is important to the reproducibility of this
test. As shown, the sample sheet 20 faces downward inside of the roof 18 and
chamber during the test. On the top surface 22 of the steel roof panel 18 were
located four thermocouple leads in the locations indicated, respectively 26, 28,
30, and 32.</p><p num="0047">A 165 mm tall Bunsen burner 24 was used as the flame source. The
height of the burner did not include the flame height. The flame height was of 
the order of 60 mm, and it was adjusted during each test so that the tip of the
inner blue cone of the flame 36, its hottest part, touched the surface of the
intumescent material. A thermocouple indicated at 34 was placed at the lower
surface of the heat deflection bar 20 and upper portion of the flame 36 to
measure the flame temperature as it impinged on the intumescent material at
that point. The flame temperature as measured by thermocouple 34 was at a
location on the intumescent material opposite the location of thermocouple 30
on the top surface 22 of the steel roof member 18.</p><p num="0048">While five thermocouple locations as indicated in Figure 1 were
initially used in testing of intumescence efficiency, experience has shown that
equivalent useful data is obtained from using only four thermocouples at
locations 26, 30, 32 and 34.</p><heading>Significant Properties of the Intumescent Material</heading><p num="0049">The molded sample sheets comprising each of the formulations of
Table 1 were exposed to the flame of the Bunsen burner in the test apparatus 10.
Figure 2 is a graph of temperature (in degrees Celsius) versus time (in minutes)
of the thermocouple measured temperatures at locations 26, 28, 30 and 32 on
the top surface 22 of steel plate 24 protected by the heat deflection bar of
Formulation 1. The curve for the flame temperature in Figure 2 is designated
34. The curves for the other thermocouple readings in Figure 2 are designated
with the number of their thermocouple location.</p><p num="0050">Figure 2 is a graph of temperature (in degrees Celsius) versus time
(minutes) of exposure to the Bunsen burner flame of the thermocouples
measured temperatures at four locations on the top surface of a steel plate
protected by the sample sheet. The flame temperature of the Bunsen burner is
set at over 1000°C. The highest temperature measured by the thermocouple in
direct contact of the flame reaches a maximum temperature of about 850°C.
The temperature reading does not reach the expected temperature because of the
cooling effect of the gases from the intumescent material and because when the
material of the sample sheet intumesces and swells, it comes in contact with the
flame thermocouple and also cools it. As illustrated in Figure 2, the maximum 
temperature reached on the top surface of the steel plate is about 247°C, which
indicates that the intumescent material was very effective in decreasing the heat
flow to the steel plate. Thus, the Intumescence Efficiency of this molded slab is
determined to be about 247°C.</p><p num="0051">Maximum temperatures for the other samples range between 201°C
and 298°C. Comparing Samples 1-3, which include Phoscheck®, with Samples
4-6, which include expandable graphite, it is observed that the properties of
Samples 1-3 and Sample 5 are very similar to each other. However, Sample 5
exhibited the highest intumescence of all samples. This result may be
attributable to the enhanced fire retardancy imparted to the corresponding
compositions by the expandable graphite. Similar results are obtained for
Samples 4 and 6 (using combinations of Phoscheck® and expandable graphite).</p><p num="0052">Upon exposure to the extreme temperatures generated by a fire, the
composite material swells to form a ceramic-like sponge, which is effective as a
heat and fire barrier. Upon burning, the elastomeric intumescent composite
materials will not melt, but instead will form a relatively strong foam barrier of
char and inorganic ceramic-like material. The elastomeric intumescent
composite material containing expandable graphite has improved fire retardant
properties over intumescent composite materials containing ammonium
dihydrogen phosphate. The substitution of expandable graphite further lowers
the overall cost of the elastomeric intumescent thermoplastic composition.
Moreover, because the composite material does not include ammonium-based
components, an ammonia odor is not produced when the elastomeric
intumescent composite material is exposed to heat or fire.</p><p num="0053">In addition, the elastomeric intumescent thermoplastic composition
containing expandable graphite has certain physical properties, as presented
above, which impart desirable characteristics to moldings fabricated from the
elastomeric intumescent thermoplastic composition. Moreover, these physical
properties include tensile strengths, elongation ratios, tear strength values,
shielding efficiency, and intumescence substantially equivalent to or better than
moldings comprising ammonia dihydrogen phosphate. These properties lend
sufficient strength and durability to the moldings so as to render the moldings 
useful when employed as a cover for electrical wiring or seals for doors,
windows, automotive parts, or other apertures, or it may be used to form panels,
dashboards, consoles, or other parts for use in automobile, aircraft, or marine
applications, or it may be used as fire shielding or thermal shielding for
residential and industrial building use, as well as other applications that will
become obvious to those skilled in various arts. In addition to molding, the
material may be extruded or vacuum formed to make parts that can be readily
assembled into a final product.</p><p num="0054">While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary
embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various
changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof
without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many
modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the
teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular
embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this
invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the
scope of the appended claims.</p></description><claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN"><claim num="1"><claim-text>A mixture for making a moldable intumescent elastomeric
