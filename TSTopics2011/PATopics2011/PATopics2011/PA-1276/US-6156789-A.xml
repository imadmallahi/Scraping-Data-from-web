The pathological conditions include the abnormal cell proliferation of malignant and nonmalignant cells of various tissues and/or organs, comprising, with no limitation being implied, muscle, bone or connective tissues, the skin, brain, lungs, sex organs, the lymphatic or renal systems, mammary or blood cells, liver, the digestive tract, pancreas and thyroid or adrenal glands. These pathological conditions can also include psoriasis, solid tumours, cancers of the ovary, breast, brain, prostate, colon, stomach, kidney or testicles, Kaposi's sarcoma, cholangioma, chorioma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, Hodgkin's disease, melanomas, multiple myelomas, lymphatic leukaemias and acute or chronic granulocytic lymphomas. The products according to the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of cancer of the ovary. The products according to the invention can be used to prevent or retard the appearance or reappearance of the pathological conditions or to treat these pathological conditions.</p><p>In particular, the compounds of general formula (I) are useful for the treatment of cancer of the brain because they manifest a significant inhibitory activity with respect to abnormal cell proliferation of malignant and nonmalignant cells of the brain. The compounds of formula (I) exhibit these properties in particular in the brain due to their longer residence time in the brain as compared to other tissues and/or organs.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 5</heading><p>Mammary C/16 adenocarcinomas were implanted in C3H/HeN female mice. At least 7 days later, 4α,10β-diacetoxy-2α-benzoyloxy-5β,20-epoxy-1β-hydroxy-7β,8β-methylene-9-oxo-19-nor-11-taxen-13α-yl (2R,3S)-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate ("Compound A") was administered to groups of female mice at doses of 9.5, 15.4, 24.8, 40 or 60.5 mg/kg by intravenous injection under 0.4 or 0.5 ml/injection over 15 seconds. The body weight and date of implantation were recorded for each mouse. Blood and tissue samples were taken 2, 5, 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 4, 14, 24 and 48 hours, after administration. The plasma was separated from the blood samples at 4 immediately. The tissue and tumors were weighed and frozen immediately (-20</p><p>The plasma and tissue samples were then analyzed for the concentration of Compound A. The plasma was assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric detection. For the tissue, liver, heart, kidney, lung, spleen and tumor tissue, samples were assayed by a first method, while a second method was used for the brain tissue analyzed. In the first method, 0.2 g of tissue was combined with 2 ml of sodium phosphate buffer 0.1 M (pH:7) and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged and 0.5 ml of supernatant was injected into the chromatographic column. In the second method, 10 μl of standard solution was combined with 0.2 g of brain tissue. 2 ml of methanol/5% perchloric acid (50/50) were added and the mixture was homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged and 100 μl of supernatant was injected into the chromatographic column.</p><p>The kinetics of Compound A in plasma and tumor tissue were linear over the range studied (9.5 to 60.5 mg/kg). The observed maximum plasma concentrations (at time 2 minutes) were linear with respect to dose and equal to 14.+-.1, 21.+-.2, 35.+-.2, 51.+-.1 and 133.+-.30 μg/ml, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of Compound A in mice with mammary tumors were similarly linear at the range of doses administered. This pharmacokinetic linearity and the comparable kinetic profile in mice with and without tumors enabled Compound A distribution in tissues (liver, heart, kidney, lung, spleen, brain, tumor), to be studied at a single, intermediate dose of 40 mg/kg, which was the highest non toxic dose (HNTD) observed in the mouse.</p><p>After administration of the 40 mg/kg intermediate dose to mice with tumors (mammary carcinoma), the kinetic profiles of Compound A exhibited fast uptake of the drug. The drug concentrations were then decreased in two phases. A rapid phase occurred first during which 70% of the drug that was present at 0.033 h after administration was cleared in one hour, except from the tumor and brain tissue. A slower phase followed, characterized by an elimination half-life ranging from 1.6 to 7.5 hours for the tissues tested, with the exception of the tumor and the brain tissue. This decrease in concentration is illustrated in Table 1, which reports the areas under tissue concentration (AUC) curves and observed elimination half-life. While brain and plasma AUCs in mice were similar at 4 hours, the 0 to infinity AUC for Compound A in mouse brain tissue was ten times that observed for plasma. These results are consistent with the long half-life of Compound A in brain tissue (47.6 h), in comparison with the half-life observed in the other tissues (1.6-9.3 h).</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 1______________________________________Pharmacokinetic parameters in tissues (dose = 40 mg/kg)      AUC (μg/ml.h) or (μg/g.h)Tissue   0-4 Hours    0 to Infinity                           t 1/2 (h)______________________________________Plasma   35.0         58.6      4.4  Liver 70.8 93 3.1  Heart 24.8 28 1.6  Kidney 74.4 121 2.7  Lung 34.3 52 2.9  Spleen 34.6 80 7.5  Brain 36.3 627 47.6  Tumor 35.6 107 9.3______________________________________</pre></p><heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p>The concentration of Compound A (μg/g) in the tissues and plasma is illustrated in the Figures.</p><p>Tissue and plasma concentration ratios at each point in time after the 40 mg/kg dose was administered are shown in Table 3 (liver, heart, kidney, lung, spleen and tumor), Tables 4 and 5 (brain) and Table 6 (tumor--all doses).

The half-life of the distribution phase in each of the tissue samples was determined to be 0.29 h in liver, 0.05 h in kidney, 0.34 h in lung, 0.23 h in spleen, 0.07 h in brain and 0.23+0.20 h in tumor tissue. For heart tissue, the half-life of the distribution phase was not calculated because of a bad fitting.</p><p>The maximum concentration of Compound A in the sampled tissues occurred at 0.033 h (heart and kidney), at 0.083 h (liver, lung, spleen) and at 0.25 h (tumor and brain).

See the Figures.</p><p>The products according to the invention can be administered to a patient in various forms adapted to the chosen route of administration which is preferably the parenteral or oral route. Parenteral administration comprises intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or subcutaneous administrations. Intraperitoneal, intravenous, or oral administration is more particularly preferred.</p><p>The present invention also comprises pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of general formula (I) in a sufficient quantity adapted to use in human or veterinary therapy. The compositions can be prepared according to the customary methods, using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, carriers or excipients. Suitable carriers include diluents, sterile aqueous media and various nontoxic solvents. Preferably, the compositions are provided in the form of aqueous solutions or suspensions, of injectable solutions which may contain emulsifying agents, colorants, preservatives or stabilizers.</p><p>The choice of adjuvants or excipients may be determined by the solubility and the chemical properties of the product, the particular mode of administration and good pharmaceutical practice, all known to the skilled artisan.</p><p>For parenteral administration, aqueous or nonaqueous sterile solutions or suspensions are used. For the preparation of nonaqueous solutions or suspensions, natural vegetable oils such as olive oil, sesame oil or paraffin oil or injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate can be used. The aqueous sterile solutions may consist of a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt in solution in water. The aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous administration insofar as the pH is appropriately adjusted and isotonicity is achieved, for example, with a sufficient quantity of sodium chloride or glucose. The sterilization can be performed by heating or by any other means which does not adversely affect the composition.</p><p>It is clearly understood that all the products entering into the compositions according to the invention should be pure and nontoxic for the quantities used.</p><p>The compositions may contain at least 0.01% of therapeutically active product. The quantity of active product in a composition is such that a suitable dosage can be prescribed. Preferably, the compositions are prepared such that a single dose contains about 0.01 to 1000 mg of active product for parenteral administration.</p><p>The therapeutic treatment can be performed concurrently with other therapeutic treatments including antineoplastic drugs, monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapies or radiotherapies or biological response modifiers. The response modifiers include, with no limitation being implied, lymphokines and cytokines such as interleukins, interferons (α, β or δ) and TNF. Other chemotherapeutic agents which are useful in the treatment of disorders caused by abnormal proliferation of cells include, with no limitation being implied, alkylating agents like nitrogen mustards such as mechloretamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan and chlorambucil, alkyl sulphonates such as busulfan, nitrosoureas such as carmustine, lomustine, semustine and streptozocin, triazenes such as dacarbazine, antimetabolites such as folic acid analogues like methotrexate, pyrimidine analogues such as fluorouracil and cytarabine, purine analogues such as mercaptopurine and thioguanine, natural products like vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, vincristine and vindesine, epipodophyllotoxins such as etoposide and teniposide, antibiotics such as dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicamycin and mitomycin, enzymes such as L-asparaginase, various agents such as coordination complexes of platinum like cisplatin, substituted ureas like hydroxyurea, methylhydrazine derivatives such as procarbazine, adrenocortical suppressants such as mitotane and aminoglutethymide, hormones and antagonists such as adrenocorticosteroids such as prednisone, progestins such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, methoxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate, oestrogens such as diethylstilbestrol and ethynylestradiol, antioestrogens such as tamoxifen, and androgens such as testosterone propionate and fluoroxymesterone.</p><p>The doses used for carrying out the methods according to the invention are those which permit a prophylactic treatment or a maximum therapeutic response. The doses vary according to the form of administration, the particular product selected and the characteristics specific to the subject to be treated. In general, the doses are those which are therapeutically effective for the treatment of disorders caused by abnormal cell proliferation. The products according to the invention can be administered as often as necessary to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to relatively high or low doses, and then require low or zero maintenance doses. Generally, low doses will be used at the beginning of the treatment and, if necessary, increasingly higher doses will be administered until an optimum effect is obtained. For other patients, it may be necessary to administer maintenance doses 1 to 8 times per day, preferably 1 to 4 times according to the physiological needs of the patient considered. It is also possible that for certain patients it may be necessary to use only one to two daily administrations.</p><p>In man, the doses generally range from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg. For intraperitoneal administration, the doses will generally range from 0.1 to 100 mg/kg and, preferably, from 0.5 to 50 mg/kg and, still more specifically, from 1 to 10 mg/kg. For intravenous administration, the doses generally range from 0.1 to 50 mg/kg and, preferably, from 0.1 to 5 mg/kg and, still more specifically, from 1 to 2 mg/kg. It is understood that, in order to choose the most appropriate dosage, account should be taken of the route of administration, the patient's weight, his general state of health, his age and all factors which may influence the efficacy of the treatment.</p><p>The following example illustrates a composition according to the invention.</p><heading>EXAMPLE 6</heading><p>40 mg of the product obtained in Example 1 were dissolved in 1 cm.sup.3 of Emulphor EL 620 and 1 cm.sup.3 of ethanol and then the solution was diluted by addition of 18 cm.sup.3 of physiological saline.</p><p>The composition was administered by perfusion for 1 hour by introduction into physiological saline.</p><p>Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that many alternatives and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description.
