together with an organo phosphite to aid in enhancing the silica reinforcement

invention further relates to an article of manufacture, including a tire, having at

elastomers which contain carbon-to-carbon double bond unsaturation in their
elastomer backbone are usually reinforced with carbon black. However, they
are sometimes reinforced with a combination of carbon black and synthetic
silica particles. In some cases, it might be desired to use only silica
reinforcement in the absence of carbon black.</p><p num="0003">A coupling agent is often used for such silica-containing rubber
compositions to aid in enabling the silica to reinforce the rubber composition.
Widely used coupling agents for such purpose are comprised of a moiety (e.g.
an alkoxysilane moiety) which is reactive with hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol
groups) on the surface of the silica and another moiety (e.g. a polysulfide
moiety) which is interactive with unsaturated elastomers which contain carbon-to-carbon
double bonds in their elastomer backbone. Such silica coupling agent
activity is believed to be well known to those skilled in such art.</p><p num="0004">However, saturated elastomers, which inherently do not have carbon-to-carbon
double bond in their backbone, such as halogenated (e.g. brominated)
copolymers of isobutylene and p-methyl styrene elastomers inherently do not
respond to sulfur bonding or crosslinking in the manner of unsaturated diene-based
elastomers.</p><p num="0005">Accordingly, coupling agents for the silica which rely upon an interaction
with diene-based elastomers which contain carbon-to-carbon double bonds
unsaturation in their backbone, namely polysulfide based couplers such as, for
example bis(3-alkoxysilylalkyl) polysulfides, are considered herein to have 
limited value for coupling the silica to the elastomer, even when the rubber
composition contains a diene hydrocarbon based elastomer, wherein the rubber
composition has an appreciable amount of an elastomeric brominated
copolymer of isobutylene and p-methyl styrene.</p><p num="0006">In practice, the aforesaid saturated halogenated copolymer elastomer
might be prepared, for example, by first copolymerizing isobutylene and p-methyl
styrene. Usually a ratio of isobutylene to p-methyl styrene in a range of
50/1 to 7/1 is used. The resulting copolymer is then halogenated with a halogen
such as bromine which occurs at the paramethyl position, yielding a benzyl
bromide functionality. The degree of bromination can typically be varied from
0.5 to 2.5, usually preferably 1.5 to 2.5, weight percent, based upon the
copolymer of isobutylene and p-methyl styrene.</p><p num="0007">The following reference provides additional information relating to the
preparation of such halogenated copolymers: "A New Isobutylene Copolymer;
Non-tire Uses" by D. Kruse and J. Fusco, <u style="single">Rubber &amp; Plastics News,</u> February 1,
1993.</p><p num="0008">Such brominated copolymer of isobutylene and p-methyl styrene may, for
example, have an unvulcanized physical property such as a Mooney viscosity
value (ML(1+8)) at 125°C in a range of 35 to 60 and a Tg in a range of -50°C to
-60°C.</p><p num="0009">It is to be appreciated that such halogenated (e.g. brominated)
copolymer elastomer has a completely saturated backbone as being devoid of
carbon-to-carbon double bond unsaturation and therefore is uniquely useful for
a rubber composition where stability of various of its physical properties desired
when the rubber composition is exposed to atmospheric conditions which
conventionally attack unsaturated diene-based elastomers and particularly
influences of oxidation and ozone attack.</p><p num="0010">However, the utility for such halogenated saturated elastomers is limited
because, as hereinbefore discussed, because of its lack of carbon-to-carbon
double bonds, it is not considered as being reactive with sulfur and is therefore
not ordinarily considered as being sulfur curable in a sense of diene
hydrocarbon-based elastomers.</p><p num="0011">Historically, some organo phosphites have previously been recognized
as being reactive with alkyl halides. For example, see <u style="single">Introduction to Organic
Chemistry,</u> 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, by A. Steitwieser, Jr., and C. H. Heathcock, Page 829,
which refers to a Arbuzov-Michaelis reaction of a phosphite with an alkyl halide.</p><p num="0012">It is contemplated herein to apply such indicated alkyl halide activity of 
organo phosphites for enhancing the utilization of silica reinforcement of rubber
compositions which contain a halogenated copolymer of isobutylene and p-methyl
styrene.</p><p num="0013">In the description of this invention, the term "phr" is used to designate
parts by weight of a material per 100 parts by weight of elastomer. In the
further description, the terms "rubber" and "elastomer" may be used
interchangeably unless otherwise mentioned. The terms "vulcanized" and
"cured" may be used interchangeably, as well as "unvulcanized" or "uncured",
unless otherwise indicated.</p><heading><u style="single">Summary and Practice of the Invention</u></heading><p num="0014">In accordance with this invention, a rubber composition comprises,

contain an additional coupling agent as, for example, an alkoxysilyl polysulfide
such as for example, a bis(3-trialkoxysilylalkyl) polysulfide wherein alkyl radicals
for said alkoxy groups are selected from one or more of methyl and ethyl

bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) polysulfide having an average of from 2 to 2.6 or from
3.5 to 4, sulfur atoms in its polysulfidic bridge.</p><p num="0017">Such additional coupling agent may, for example, be added directly to
the elastomer mixture or may be added as a composite of precipitated silica and
such coupling agent formed by treating a precipitated silica therewith or by
treating a colloidal silica therewith and precipitating the resulting composite.</p><p num="0018">In further accordance with this invention, an article of manufacture is
provided which contains at least one component comprised of the rubber
composition of this invention.</p><p num="0019">In additional accordance with this invention, a tire is provided which
contains at least one component comprised of the rubber composition of this
invention.</p><p num="0020">In further accordance with this invention, a tire is provided having a tread
comprised of the rubber composition of this invention.</p><p num="0021">A significant aspect of this invention is the use of a reaction product of 
said organo phosphite and a said halogenated (preferably brominated)
copolymer of isobutylene and p-methyl styrene in order to improve the polymer
(e.g. elastomer) to filler interaction (via reaction of the organo phosphite with
the halogen of the halogenated copolymer of isobutylene and p-methyl styrene)
to thereby enhance resulting rubber composition properties leading to enhanced
tire component (e.g. tire tread) properties including aged performance such as,
for example durability and/or stability properties.</p><p num="0022">Representative examples of organo phosphites understood to be
commercially available are, for example for example, triisodecyl phosphite,
trilauryl phosphite, tris(tridecyl) phosphite, diphenyl isooctyl phosphite, diphenyl
isodecyl phosphite, phenyl diisodecyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite,
triisononylphenyl phosphite, trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, tris (2-chloroethyl)
phosphite, triisopropyl phosphite, tributyl phosphite, triisooctyl
phosphite and tris (2-ethylhexyl) phosphite, as well as tris (2,4-dit-butylphenyl)
phosphite, and bis 2,4,6,tri-t-butylphenyl 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol
phosphite; and diphosphites as, for example, distearyl pentaerythritol
diphosphite, bis (2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite, bis (2,6,di-t-butyl-4-methylphenyl
pentaerythritol diphosphite, bis (2,4-dicumylphenyl)
pentaerythritol diphosphite and mixtures thereof.</p><p num="0023">Such organo phosphite may be, for example, tris (2-ethylhexyl) phosphite
or triphenyl phosphite.</p><p num="0024">In practice, the synthetic amorphous silica may be selected from
aggregates of precipitated silica, which is intended to include precipitated
aluminosilicates as a co-precipitated silica and aluminum, and from fumed
(pyrogenically formed) silica.</p><p num="0025">Such precipitated silica is, in general, well known to those having skill in
such art. For example, such precipitated silica may be precipitated by
controlled addition of an acid such as, for example, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric
acid, to a basic solution (e.g. sodium hydroxide) of a silicate, for example,
sodium silicate, usually in the presence of an electrolyte, for example, sodium
sulfate. Primary, colloidal silica particles typically form during such process
which quickly coalesce to form aggregates of such primary particles and which
are then recovered as precipitates by filtering, washing the resulting filter cake
with water or an aqueous solution, and drying the recovered precipitated silica.
Such method of preparing precipitated silica, and variations thereof, are well
known to those having skill in such art.</p><p num="0026">The silica treated carbon black relates to carbon black which contains 
domains of exposed silica on the surface of the carbon black. Such carbon
black may be prepared, for example, by reaction of an alkyl silane (e.g. an
alkoxy silane) with carbon black or by co-fuming carbon black and silica at an
elevated temperature. For example, see US-A- 5,679,728 and 6,028,137.</p><p num="0027">In the further practice of the invention, the aforesaid in situ reaction of
said organo phosphite silica material within the elastomer host via said internal
rubber mixing process is accomplished wherein said silica material is a
precipitated silica and/or silica-containing carbon black which is hydrophobated
prior to its addition to the elastomer (pre-hydrophobated). Such in situ reaction
is considered herein to be important as to both the process of mixing and
reacting of the organo phosphite and pre-hydrophobated silica material as to a
resulting product thereof. In particular, is it considered herein that pre-hydrophobation
of the silica material, particularly with an alkyl silane of the
general formula (III) enables a more efficient mixing, or processing, of it within
the elastomer host in that such pre-hydrophobation of the silica material
<sl><li>(A) renders it more compatible with the diene-based elastomer and</li><li>(B) substantially reduces a tendency for a precipitated silica to
agglomerate with itself within the elastomer host.</li></sl></p><p num="0028">In the practice of this invention, said pre-hydrophobated precipitated
silica aggregates may be pre-hydrophobated, for example, by treating silica in
an aqueous colloidal form thereof with said alkylsilane of Formula (III).</p><p num="0029">The hydrophobated precipitated silica aggregates might be recovered,
for example, from said treated colloidal silica, for example as a treated silica
hydrosol, with the aid of acid addition to the treated colloidal silica (for example,
sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid) followed by water washing and drying the
recovered hydrophobated silica as a hydrophobated silica gel or as a
hydrophobated precipitated silica. While this invention is not intended to be
directed to a specific preparation technique (preparation of silica hydrosols,
recovery of silica gels and precipitated silicas, etc.) of the pre-hydrophobated
precipitated silica itself, for education purposes in this regard, reference might
be made to US-A- 5,094,829 as well as 5,708,069, 5,789,514 and 5,750,610 for
a more detailed discussion.</p><p num="0030">Representative alkylsilanes of Formula (III) are, for example, trichloro
methyl silane, dichloro dimethyl silane, chloro trimethyl silane, trimethoxy methyl
silane, dimethoxy dimethyl silane, methoxy trimethyl silane, trimethoxy propyl
silane, trimethoxy octyl silane, trimethoxy hexadecyl silane, dimethoxy dipropyl
silane, triethoxy methyl silane, triethoxy propyl silane, triethoxy octyl silane, and 
diethoxy dimethyl silane.</p><p num="0031">In practice, various diene-based elastomers may be used such as, for
example, homopolymers and copolymers of monomers selected from isoprene
and 1,3-butadiene and copolymers of at least one diene selected from isoprene
and 1,3-butadiene and a vinyl aromatic compound selected from styrene and
alphamethyl styrene, preferably styrene.</p><p num="0032">Representative of such conjugated diene-based elastomers are, for
example, cis 1,4-polyisoprene (natural and synthetic), cis 1,4-polybutadiene,
styrene/butadiene copolymers (aqueous emulsion polymerization prepared and
organic solvent solution polymerization prepared), high vinyl polybutadiene
having a vinyl 1,2-content in a range of 15 to 90 percent, isoprene/butadiene
copolymers, styrene/ isoprene/butadiene terpolymers. Tin coupled elastomers
may also be used, such as, for example, tin coupled organic solution
polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene co-polymers, isoprene/butadiene
copolymers, styrene/isoprene copolymers, polybutadiene and
styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymers.</p><p num="0033">The brominated poly(isobutylene-co-para-methylstyrene) polymer may
be obtained, for example, as Exxpro® 3745, a trademark of the ExxonMobil
Chemical Company.</p><p num="0034">In the further practice of this invention, particulate reinforcement for the
rubber composition may be particulate synthetic amorphous silica, or a
combination of carbon black and amorphous silica (exclusive of silica treated
carbon black), usually of an amount in a range of 25 to 100 alternately 35 to 90,
phr. If a combination of such carbon black and silica is used, usually at least
about 5 phr of carbon black and at least 10 phr of silica are used. For example,
a weight ratio of silica to carbon black ranging from 1/5 to 5/1 might be used.</p><p num="0035">Commonly employed synthetic amorphous silica, or siliceous pigments,
used in rubber compounding applications can be used as the silica in this
invention, including precipitated siliceous pigments and fumed (pyrogenic) silica
wherein aggregates of precipitated silicas are usually preferred.</p><p num="0036">The precipitated silica aggregates preferably employed in this invention
are precipitated silicas such as, for example, those obtained by the acidification
of a soluble silicate, e.g., sodium silicate and may include co-precipitated silica
and a minor amount of aluminum.</p> <p num="0037">Such silicas might usually be characterized, for example, by having a
BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, preferably in the range of
40 to 600, and more usually in a range of 50 to 300 square meters per gram. 
The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the <u style="single">Journal of the
American Chemical Society,</u> Volume 60, Page 304 (1930).</p><p num="0038">The silica may also be typically characterized by having a
dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of 50 to 400 cm<sup>3</sup>/100g, and
more usually 100 to 300 cm<sup>3</sup>/100g.</p><p num="0039">Various commercially available precipitated silicas may be considered for
use in this invention such as, only for example herein, and without limitation,
silicas from PPG Industries under the Hi-Sil trademark with designations Hi-Sil®
210, Hi-Sil® 243, etc; silicas from Rhodia as, for example, Zeosil® 1165MP and
Zeosil® 165GR, silicas from J. M. Huber Corporation as Zeopol® 8745 and
Zeopol® 8715, silicas from Degussa AG with, for example, designations VN2
and VN3, as well as other grades of silica, particularly precipitated silicas, which
can be used for elastomer reinforcement.</p><p num="0040">It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber
composition would be compounded by methods generally known in the rubber
compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent
rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example,
curing aids, such as sulfur, activators, retarders and accelerators, processing
additives, such as oils, resins including tackifying resins, silicas, and
plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and
antiozonants, peptizing agents and reinforcing materials such as, for example,
carbon black. As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the intended
use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the
additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional
amounts.</p><p num="0041">Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise 0.5 to 10 phr,
usually 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise 1 to 50 phr.
Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, naphthenic, and/or
paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise 1 to 5 phr.
Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine
and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in <u style="single">The Vanderbilt Rubber
Handbook</u> (1978), Pages 344 through 346. Typical amounts of antiozonants
comprise 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include
stearic acid comprise 0.5 to 3 phr. Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise 1 to
10 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise 1 to 5 phr. Often microcrystalline
waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers comprise 0.1 to 1 phr.</p> <p num="0042">The vulcanization is conducted in the presence of a sulfur vulcanizing 
agent. Examples of suitable sulfur vulcanizing agents include elemental sulfur
(free sulfur) or sulfur donating vulcanizing agents, for example, an amine
disulfide, polymeric polysulfide or sulfur olefin adducts. Preferably, the sulfur
vulcanizing agent is elemental sulfur. As known to those skilled in the art, sulfur
vulcanizing agents are used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 4 phr, or even, in
some circumstances, up to 8 phr.</p> <p num="0043">Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for
vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one
embodiment, a single accelerator system may be used, i.e., primary
accelerator. Conventionally and preferably, a primary accelerator(s) is used in
total amounts ranging from 0.5 to 4, preferably 0.8 to 2.5, phr. In another
embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be
used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts (of 0.05 to
3 phr) in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate.
Combinations of these accelerators might be expected to produce a synergistic
effect on the final properties and are somewhat better than those produced by
use of either accelerator alone. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be
used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures but produce a
satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization
retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used
in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles,
thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the
primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the
secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram
compound.</p> <p num="0044">The presence and relative amounts of the above additives are not
considered to be an aspect of the present invention, unless otherwise indicated
herein, which is more primarily directed to the utilization an organo phosphite for
enhancing reinforcement of a halogenated (e.g. brominated) poly(isobutylene-co-para-methylstyrene)
polymer with a particulate synthetic amorphous silica
material which contains hydroxyl groups (e.g. silanol groups) on its surface.</p><p num="0045">The mixing of the rubber composition can be accomplished by methods
known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. For example, the
ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely, at least one non-productive
stage followed by a productive mix stage. The final curatives are
typically mixed in the final stage which is conventionally called the "productive"
mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate 
temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive
mix stage(s). The rubber, and fillers such as silica and silica treated
carbon black and coupling agent, are mixed in one or more non-productive mix
stages. The terms "non-productive" and "productive" mix stages are well known
to those having skill in the rubber mixing art.</p><heading><u style="single">EXAMPLE I</u></heading><p num="0046">Samples A and B are reported herein as rubber samples which contain a
brominated copolymer of isobutylene and para-methyl stryene rubber (also
referred to as "BIMS" rubber) as well as at least one diene-based elastomer and
silica reinforcement. Sample B also contained an organo phosphite, namely
triphenyl phosphite, as a coupling agent for said BIMS.</p><p num="0047">For the Samples A and B, a total of three non-productive mixing steps
were used for the silica reinforced rubber compositions. The rubber
compositions were dumped from the rubber mixer after each mixing step,
sheeted out from an open mill and allowed to cool to below 40°C after each
mixing step.</p><p num="0048">The representative rubber compositions shown are in the following Table
