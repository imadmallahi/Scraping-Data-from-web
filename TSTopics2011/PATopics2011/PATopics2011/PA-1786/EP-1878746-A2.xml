Oncology 4:277-296 (1994)</text></nplcit>.</p><p num="p0005">ImClone has been conducting human clinical trials using the anti-EGF-r antibody designated C225. Phase I and Phase I/II clinical trials in patients with head and neck, prostate, and lung carcinomas apparently have been, or are currently being, conducted with C225. In Phase I clinical trials, no toxicity was detected with multiple injections and with doses of up to perhaps 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, even in cases involving immunocompromised patients. Such studies were conducted as dose escalation studies comprising 5 doses of from about 5 to about 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and were performed in combination with chemotherapy (i.e., doxorubicin, adriamycin, taxol, and cisplatin). In addition to the apparent safety data that has been generated in these studies, preliminary results from the studies appear to indicate some evidence of tumor shrinkage in 80% of patients having prostate cancer.</p><p num="p0006">Each of these above-mentioned antibodies, however, possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, it has been postulated that one could introduce human antibody function into a rodent so that the rodent would produce fully human antibodies.</p><p num="p0007">The ability to clone and reconstruct megabase-sized human loci in YACs and to introduce them into the mouse germline provides a powerful approach to elucidating the functional components of very large or crudely mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human disease. Furthermore, the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with their human equivalents could provide unique insights into the expression and regulation of human gene products during development, their communication with other systems, and their involvement in disease induction and progression.</p><p num="p0008">An important practical application of such a strategy is the "humanization" of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated offers the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying programmed expression and assembly of antibodies as well as their role in B-cell development. Furthermore, such a strategy could provide an ideal source for production of fully human monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) - an important milestone towards fulfilling the promise of antibody therapy in human disease. Fully human antibodies are expected to minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses intrinsic to mouse or mouse-derivatized Mabs and thus<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> to increase the efficacy and safety of the administered antibodies. The use of fully human antibodies can be expected to provide a substantial advantage in the treatment of chronic and recurring human diseases, such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer, which require repeated antibody administrations.</p><p num="p0009">One approach towards this goal was to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci in anticipation that such mice would produce a large repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments would preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to human proteins, the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains should yield high affinity antibodies against any antigen of interest, including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human Mabs with the desired specificity could be readily produced and selected.</p><p num="p0010">This general strategy was demonstrated in connection with our generation of the first XenoMouse™ strains as published in 1994. See <nplcit id="ncit0013" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Green et al. Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994)</text></nplcit>. The XenoMouse™ strains were engineered with yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing 245 kb and 190 kb-sized germline configuration fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus, respectively, which contained core variable and constant region sequences.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> Id. The human Ig containing YACs proved to be compatible with the mouse system for both rearrangement and expression of antibodies and were capable of substituting for the inactivated mouse Ig genes. This was demonstrated by their ability to induce B-cell development, to produce an adult-like human repertoire of fully human antibodies, and to generate antigen-specific human Mabs. These results also suggested that introduction of larger portions of the human Ig loci containing greater numbers of V genes, additional regulatory elements, and human Ig constant regions might recapitulate substantially the full repertoire that is characteristic of the human humoral response to infection and immunization.

The inventors on the GenPharm International work, cited above, Lonberg and Kay, following the lead of the present inventors, proposed inactivation of the endogenous mouse Ig locus coupled with substantial duplication of the Surani <i>et al.</i> work.</p><p num="p0014">An advantage of the minilocus approach is the rapidity with which constructs including portions of the Ig locus can be generated and introduced into animals. Commensurately, however, a significant disadvantage of the minilocus approach is that, in theory, insufficient diversity is introduced through<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the inclusion of small numbers of V, D, and J genes. Indeed, the published work appears to support this concern. B-cell development and antibody production of animals produced through use of the minilocus approach appear stunted. Therefore, research surrounding the present invention has consistently been directed towards the introduction of large portions of the Ig locus in order to achieve greater diversity and in an effort to reconstitute the immune repertoire of the animals.</p><p num="p0015">Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) responses have led the industry to prepare chimeric or otherwise humanized antibodies.

<ul list-style="bullet"><li>The term "isolated polynucleotide" as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin the "isolated polynucleotide" (1) is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the "isolated polynucleotide" is found in nature, (2) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.</li><li>The term "isolated protein" referred to herein means a protein of cDNA, recombinant RNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin, or source of derivation, the "isolated protein" (1) is not associated with proteins found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g. free of murine proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --></li><li>The term "polypeptide" is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein, fragments, and analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention comprise the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules represented by Figures 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and 29 and the human kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules represented by Figures 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, and 31, as well as antibody molecules formed by combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain immunoglobulin molecules, such as the kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof.</li><li>The term "naturally-occurring" as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.</li><li>The term "operably linked" as used herein refers to positions of components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence "operably linked" to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences.<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --></li><li>The term "control sequence" as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences which are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are ligated. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term "control sequences" is intended to include, at a minimum, all components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences.</li><li>The term "polynucleotide" as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.</li><li>The term "oligonucleotide" referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring oligonucleotide linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> stranded, e.g. for probes; although oligonucleotides may be double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides of the invention can be either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.</li><li>The term "naturally occurring nucleotides" referred to herein includes deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides.

An oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.</li><li>The term "selectively hybridize" referred to herein means to detectably and specifically bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> in accordance with the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, and fragments of the invention and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%. Two amino acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See <nplcit id="ncit0023" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Dayhoff, M.O., in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, pp. 101-110 (Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972</text></nplcit>)) and Supplement 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> aligned using the ALIGN program. The term "corresponds to" is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the term "complementary to" is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence "TATAC" corresponds to a reference sequence "TATAC" and is complementary to a reference sequence "GTATA".</li></ul></p><p num="p0034">The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotide or amino acid sequences: "reference sequence", "comparison window", "sequence identity", "percentage of sequence identity", and "substantial identity". A "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 18 nucleotides or 6 amino acids in length, frequently at least 24 nucleotides or 8 amino acids in length, and often at least 48 nucleotides or 16 amino acids in length. Since two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide or amino acid<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> sequence) that is similar between the two molecules, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) molecules are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two molecules over a "comparison window" to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A "comparison window", as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least 18 contiguous nucleotide positions or 6 amino acids wherein a polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 18 contiguous nucleotides or 6 amino acid sequences and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions, deletions, substitutions, and the like (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of <nplcit id="ncit0024" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Smith and Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981</text></nplcit>), by the homology alignment algorithm of <nplcit id="ncit0025" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970</text></nplcit>), by the search for similarity method of <nplcit id="ncit0026" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 85:2444 (1988</text></nplcit>), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, (Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), Geneworks, or MacVector software packages), or by<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.</p><p num="p0035">The term "sequence identity" means that two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or residue-by-residue basis) over the comparison window. The term "percentage of sequence identity" is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) or residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms "substantial identity" as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more usually at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 18 nucleotide (6 amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino acid) positions, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> the comparison window. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.</p><p num="p0036">As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See <nplcit id="ncit0027" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Immunology - A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E.S. Golub and D.R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991</text></nplcit>)), which is incorporated herein by reference. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-, α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ∈-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, ∈-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the lefthand direction is the amino terminal direction and the righthand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.</p><p num="p0037">Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the lefthand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end; the lefthand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as "upstream sequences"; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as "downstream sequences".</p><p num="p0038">As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine,<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamic-aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.</p><p num="p0039">As discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the present invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, 90%, 95%, and most preferably 99%. In particular, conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic=aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic=lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) nonpolar=alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar=glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. More preferred families are: serine and threonine are aliphatic-hydroxy family; asparagine and glutamine are an amide-containing family; alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine are an aliphatic family; and phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are an aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding or properties of the resulting molecule, especially if the replacement does not<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. <nplcit id="ncit0028" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Bowie et al. Science 253:164 (1991</text></nplcit>). Thus, the foregoing examples demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the invention.</p><p num="p0040">Preferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (5) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --> sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in <nplcit id="ncit0029" status="new" npl-type="b"><text>Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W.

Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably at least 14 amino acids long, more preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long, and even more preferably at least 70 amino acids long. The term "analog" as used herein refers to polypeptides which<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> are comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced amino acid sequence and which has at least one of the following properties: (1) specific binding to a EGF-r, under suitable binding conditions, (2) ability to EGF binding to its receptor, or (3) ability to inhibit EGF-r expressing cell growth in vitro or in vivo. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.</p><p num="p0042">Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drus with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed "peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics". <nplcit id="ncit0032" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Fauchere, J. Adv.

Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: --CH<sub>2</sub>NH--, --CH<sub>2</sub>S--, --CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>--,-CH=CH--(cis and trans), --COCH<sub>2</sub>--, --CH(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>--, and -CH<sub>2</sub>SO--, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (<nplcit id="ncit0035" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Rizo and Gierasch Ann.

Binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')<sub>2</sub>, Fv, and single-chain antibodies. An antibody other than a "bispecific" or "bifunctional" antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical.

In particular, in the heavy chains of the antibodies, all of the heavy chain molecules are encoded by V<sub>H</sub> 4 family genes and have a Glycine in position 10 in V<sub>H</sub> 4-31 encoded antibodies and Serine in position 10 in V<sub>H</sub> 4-61 encoded antibodies are each substituted with an Aspartic Acid. Also in the V<sub>H</sub> 4-31 heavy chains, all but one of the antibodies includes a Serine in position 7 substitution to Asparagine. A similar, though not quite as predominant substitution is observed in position 35, where a Serine in two of the V<sub>H</sub> 4-31 encoded antibodies and two of the V<sub>H</sub> 4-61<!-- EPO <DP n="69"> --> encoded antibodies is substituted with an Asparagine. Also, in two of the V<sub>H</sub> 4-31 encoded antibodies and two of the V<sub>H</sub> 4-61 encoded antibodies there are substitutions at position 28, where in each case, a Tyrosine is substituted with a Serine (E2.4) or a Histidine (E6.4, E2.11, and E7.6.3). Five of the antibodies, three of the V<sub>H</sub> 4-31 encoded antibodies and two of the V<sub>H</sub> 4-61 encoded antibodies, possess Valine to Leucine (E2.4 and E2.11) or Isoleucine (E2.5, E6.2, and E7.6.3) at position 50.</p><p num="p0122">In connection with the kappa light chains amino acid sequences, all of the sequences are encoded by V<sub>K</sub> I family genes, with seven of the molecules being encoded by 018 genes and one (E6.4) being encoded by an 012 gene. There is a high degree of homology between the 012 and 018 gene products, as evidenced when the E6.4 molecule is compared with the 018 gene product, along with the other molecules, in Figure 34. The E6.4 molecule possesses only two substitutions relative to the 012 gene product, as shown in Figure 19, and only 13 substitutions relative to the 018 gene product. All of the antibodies possess a substitution at position 74 in CDR3 where an Asparagine is substituted with a Serine (E1.1, E2.5, E2.11, and E6.3), Histidine (E2.4, E6.2, and E7.6.3), or Arginine (E6.4). The remainder of the substitutions are less highly conserved. However, a number of the antibodies appear to possess substitutions within the CDR's. However, it is interesting to note that E7.6.3, which is an antibody with very high affinities, possesses no amino acid substitutions in the light chain amino acid sequence until just proximal to CDR3 and within CDR3.<!-- EPO <DP n="70"> --></p><p num="p0123">It will be appreciated that each of the above-identified amino acid substitutions exist in close proximity to or within a CDR. Such substitutions would appear to bear some effect upon the binding of the antibody to the EGF receptor molecule. Further, such substitutions could have significant effect upon the affinity of the antibodies.</p><p num="p0124">As was discussed above, anti-EGF-r antibodies have been demonstrated to possess certain anti-tumor activities.

Based upon a number of factors, including EGF-r expression levels, among others, the following tumor types appear to present preferred indications: breast, ovarian, colon, prostate, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer. In connection with each of these indications, three clinical pathways appear to offer distinct potentials for clinical success:</p><p num="p0149"><u style="single">Adjunctive therapy</u>: In adjunctive therapy, patients would be treated with antibodies in accordance with the present invention in combination with a chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic agent and/or radiation therapy. The primary targets listed above will be treated under protocol by the addition of antibodies of the invention to standard first and second line therapy. Protocol designs will address effectiveness as assessed by reduction in tumor mass as well as the ability to reduce usual doses of standard chemotherapy. These dosage reductions will allow additional and/or prolonged therapy by reducing dose-related toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent. Prior art anti-EGF-r antibodies have been, or are being, utilized in several adjunctive clinical trials in combination with the chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic agents adriamycin (C225: advanced prostrate carcinoma), cisplatin (C225: advanced head and neck and lung carcinomas), taxol (C225: breast cancer), and doxorubicin (C225: preclinical).</p><p num="p0150"><u style="single">Monotherapy</u>: In connection with the use of the<!-- EPO <DP n="81"> --> antibodies in accordance with the present invention in monotherapy of tumors, the antibodies will be adminstered to patients without a chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic agent. Preclinical results generated through use of antibodies in accordance with the present invention and discussed herein have demonstrated similar results with both adjunctive therapy and/or as a stand-alone therapy. Moreover, monotherapy has apparently been conducted clinically in end stage cancer patients with extensive metastatic disease. Patients appeared to show some disease stabilization. Id. Trials will be designed to demonstrate an effect in refractory patients with (cancer) tumor.</p><p num="p0151"><u style="single">Imaging Agent</u>: Through binding a radionuclide (e.g., yttrium (<sup>90</sup>Y)) to antibodies in accordance with the present invention, it is expected that radiolabeled antibodies in accordance with the present invention can be utilized as a diagnostic, imaging agent. In such a role, antibodies of the invention will localize to both solid tumors, as well as, metastatic lesions of cells expressing the EGF receptor. In connection with the use of the antibodies of the invention as imaging agents, the antibodies can be used in assisting surgical treatment of solid tumors, as both a pre-surgical screen as well as a post operative follow to determine what tumor remain and/or returns. An (<sup>111</sup>In)-C225 antibody has been used as an imaging agent in a Phase I human clinical trial in patients having unresectable squamous cell lung carcinomas. <nplcit id="ncit0045" status="new" npl-type="s"><text>Divgi et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:97-104 (1991)</text></nplcit>. Patients were followed with standard anterior and posterior<!-- EPO <DP n="82"> --> gamma camera.

The C225 antibody is typically being administered with doses in the range of 5 to 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, with the lower doses used only in connection with the safety studies. Antibodies in accordance with the invention have a one-log higher affinity than the C225 antibody. Further, antibodies in accordance with the present invention are fully human antibodies, as compared to the chimeric nature of the C225 antibody and, thus, antibody clearance would be expected to be slower. Accordingly, we would expect that dosing in patients with antibodies in accordance with the invention can be lower, perhaps in the range of 50 to 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and still remain efficacious. Dosing in mg/m<sup>2</sup>, as opposed to the conventional measurement of dose in mg/kg, is a measurement based on surface area and is a convenient dosing measurement that is designed to include patients of all sizes from infants to adults.</p><p num="p0153">Three distinct delivery approaches are expected to be useful for delivery of the antibodies in accordance with the invention. Conventional intravenous delivery will presumably be the standard delivery technique for<!-- EPO <DP n="83"> --> the majority of tumors. However, in connection with tumors in the peritoneal cavity, such as tumors of the ovaries, biliary duct, other ducts, and the like, intraperitoneal administration may prove favorable for obtaining high dose of antibody at the tumor and to minimize antibody clearance. In a similar manner certain solid tumors possess vasculature that is appropriate for regional perfusion. Regional perfusion will allow the obtention of a high dose of the antibody at the site of a tumor and will minimize short term clearance of the antibody.</p><heading><b><u style="single">Clinical Development Plan (CDP)</u></b></heading><p num="p0154"><u style="single">Overview</u>: The CDP will follow and develop treatments of anti-EGF-r antibodies in accordance with the invention in connection with adjunctive therapy, monotherapy, and as an imaging agent.

Patients will be closely followed for one-week following each administration of antibody and chemotherapy. In particular, patients will be assessed for the safety concerns mentioned above: (i) cytokine release syndrome, i.e., hypotension, fever, shaking, chills, (ii) the development of an immunogenic response to the material (i.e., development of human antibodies by the patient to the human antibody therapeutic, or HAHA response), and (iii) toxicity to normal cells that express the EGF receptor, e.g., hepatocytes which express EGF-r.
