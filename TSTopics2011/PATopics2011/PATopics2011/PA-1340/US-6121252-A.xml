Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relate to phosphinic acid derivatives that inhibit N-Acetylated α-Linked Acidic Dipeptidase (NAALADase) enzyme activity, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, and methods of using the same to inhibit NAALADase activity and to treat glutamate abnormalities and prostate diseases.</p><p>2. Description of the Prior Art</p><p>Glutamate Abnormalities</p><p>Glutamate serves as the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) Neurons release glutamate in great quantities when they are deprived of oxygen, as may occur during an ischemic brain insult such as a stroke or a heart attack. This excess release of glutamate in turn causes over-stimulation (excitotoxicity) of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), AMPA, Kainate and MGR receptors. When glutamate binds to these receptors, ion channels in the receptors open, permitting flows of ions across their cell membranes, e.g., Ca.sup.2+  and Na.sup.+  into the cells and K.sup.+  out of the cells. These flows of ions, especially the influx of Ca.sup.2+, cause over-stimulation of the neurons. The over-stimulated neurons secrete more glutamate, creating a domino-effect which ultimately results in cell death via the production of proteases, lipases and free radicals.</p><p>Excessive activation of glutamate receptors has been implicated in various neurological diseases and conditions, including epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's Disease, schizophrenia, chronic pain, ischemia and neuronal loss following hypoxia, hypoglycemia, ischemia, trauma, and nervous insult. Recent studies have also advanced a glutamatergic basis for compulsive disorders, particularly drug dependence.</p><p>As an example, neurophysiological and pathological effects of ethanol have been found to be mediated through the glutamatergic system. Specifically, acute exposure to ethanol disrupts glutamatergic neurotransmission by inhibiting ion flow through channels in glutamate receptors, whereas chronic exposure up-regulates the number of glutamate receptors and thereby increases ion flow. Acute withdrawal from ethanol results in hyperexcitability and seizures in the presence of up-regulated channels, thereby making postsynaptic neurons vulnerable to excitotoxic damage.</p><p>Post mortem examinations of histologically normal brains from alcoholics have shown that chronic alcoholism moderately increases the density of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors in the frontal cortex. This up-regulation may represent a stage of ethanol-induced chronic neurotoxicity. As such, neurobiological effects of alcoholism, including intoxication, withdrawal seizures, delirium tremens, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome, can be understood as a spectrum of the consequences of ethanol's effect on the glutamatergic system. In this regard, alcoholism may be considered another member of the expanding family of glutamate-related neurological disorders.</p><p>The glutamatergic system has also been implicated in the behavioral effects of other abused drugs. For example, studies have shown that glutamatergic antagonists block motor-stimulating activities induced by amphetamine and cocaine, and glutamatergic agonists cause the same stereotypy as that produced by amphetamine. These results represent pharmacological evidence that the expression of the stereotypic effect of psychomotor stimulants involves the glutamatergic system.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have revealed a strong correlation between drug dependence and other compulsive disorders. Additionally, a common genetic anomaly has been found among people with alcoholism, cocaine dependence, nicotine dependence, pathological gambling, attention deficit disorder (ADD), Tourette's syndrome, compulsive overeating and obesity. Such disorders are believed to be manifestations of the effects of excitotoxicity.</p><p>Attempts to prevent excitotoxicity by blocking NMDA, AMPA, Kainate and MGR receptors have proven difficult because each receptor has multiple sites to which glutamate may bind. Many of the compositions that are effective in blocking the receptors are also toxic to animals. As such, there is currently no known effective treatment for glutate abnormalities.</p><p>Prostate Cancer</p><p>Prostate cancer is the leading form of cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer for men in the United States. The American Cancer Society has estimated that in 1996 alone, 317,100 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and 41,400 deaths were caused by prostate cancer. The incidence rate of prostate cancer increased 65% between 1980 and 1990, and will continue to rise with improved screening tests and longer life expectancies. While most men used to die of other illnesses before prostate cancer had a chance to develop, higher prostate cancer mortality rates are expected as men live longer and the disease has more time to progress.</p><p>In 1993, the molecular cloning of Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) was reported as a potential prostate carcinoma marker and hypothesized to serve as a target for imaging and cytotoxic treatment modalities for prostate cancer. PSMA antibodies, particularly indium-111 labelled and itrium labelled PSMA antibodies, have been described and examined clinically for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. PSMA is expressed in prostatic ductal epithelium and is present in seminal plasma, prostatic fluid and urine. In 1996, it was found that the expression of PSMA cDNA confers the activity of NAALADase.</p><p>NAALADase Inhibitors</p><p>NAAG and NAALADase have been implicated in several human and animal pathological conditions. For example, it has been demonstrated that intra-hippocampal injections of NAAG elicit prolonged seizure activity. More recently, it was reported that rats genetically prone to epileptic seizures have a persistent increase in their basal level of NAALADase activity. These observations support the hypothesis that increased availability of synaptic glutamate elevates seizure susceptibility, and suggest that NAALADase inhibitors may provide anti-epileptic activity.</p><p>NAAG and NAALADase have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS and in the pathologically similar animal disease called Hereditary Canine Spinal Muscular Atrophy (HCSMA). It has been shown that concentrations of NAAG and its metabolites--NAA, glutamate and aspartate--are elevated two- to three-fold in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients and HCSMA dogs. Additionally, NAALADase activity is significantly increased (two- to three-fold) in post-mortem spinal cord tissue from ALS patients and HCSMA dogs. As such, NAALADase inhibitors may be clinically useful in curbing the progression of ALS if increased metabolism of NAAG is responsible for the alterations of CSF levels of these acidic amino acids and peptides.</p><p>Abnormalities in NAAG levels and NAALADase activity have also been documented in post-mortem schizophrenic brain, specifically in the prefrontal and limbic brain regions.</p><p>The findings described above suggest that NAALADase inhibitors could be useful in treating glutamate abnormalities. In fact, the results of studies conducted by the inventors confirm that NAALADase inhibitors are effective in treating glutamate abnormalities (particularly stroke, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injury, alcoholism and nicotine dependence), as well as prostate diseases (particularly prostate cancer).</p><p>While a few NAALADase inhibitors have been identified, they have only been used in non-clinical research. Examples of such inhibitors include general metallopeptidase inhibitors such as o-phenanthroline, metal chelators such as EGTA and EDTA, and peptide analogs such as quisqualic acid and β-NAAG. Accordingly, a need exists for new NAALADase inhibitors, as well as pharmaceutical compositions and methods using such new and known NAALADase inhibitors to treat glutamate abnormalities and prostate diseases.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The present invention relates to a compound of formula I ##STR1## or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, or prodrug thereof,

characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattention and impulsivity, with or without hyperactivity. Inattention means a failure to finish tasks started, easy distractibility, seeming lack of attention, and difficulty concentrating on tasks requiring sustained attention. Impulsivity means acting before thinking, difficulty taking turns, problems organizing work, and constant shifting from one activity to another. Hyperactivity means difficulty staying seated and sitting still, and running or climbing excessively.</p><p>"Compound 3" refers to 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid.</p><p>"Compound 16" refers to 2-[[(pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid.</p><p>"Compound 17" refers to 2-[[(3-trifluoromethylbenzyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid.</p><p>"Compound 18" refers to 2-[[[hydroxy(pyridyl)methyl]hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid.</p><p>"Compulsive disorder" refers to any disorder characterized by irresistible impulsive behavior. Examples of compulsive disorders include without limitation drug dependence, eating disorders, pathological gambling, ADD and Tourette's syndrome.</p><p>"Drug dependence" refers to a psychologic addiction or a physical tolerance to a drug. Tolerance means a need to increase the dose progressively in order to produce the effect originally achieved by smaller amounts.</p><p>"Eating disorder" refers to compulsive overeating, obesity or severe obesity. Obesity means body weight of 20% over standard height-weight tables. Severe obesity means over 100% overweight.</p><p>"Glutamate abnormality" refers to any disease, disorder or condition in which glutamate is implicated, including pathological conditions involving elevated levels of glutamate. Examples of glutamate abnormalities include epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's Disease, schizophrenia, chronic pain, ischemia, neuronal insult and compulsive disorders.</p><p>"Glutamate modulator" refers to any composition of matter which alone or in combination with another agent affects the level of glutamate in an animal.</p><p>"Inhibition", in the context of enzymes, refers to reversible enzyme inhibition such as competitive, uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition. Competitive, uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition can be distinguished by the effects of an inhibitor on the reaction kinetics of an enzyme. Competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor combines reversibly with the enzyme in such a way that it competes with a normal substrate for binding at the active site. The affinity between the inhibitor and the enzyme may be measured by the inhibitor constant, K.sub.i, which is defined as: ##EQU1## wherein [E] is the concentration of the enzyme, [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor, and [EI] is the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex formed by the reaction of the enzyme with the inhibitor. Unless otherwise specified, K.sub.i as used herein refers to the affinity between the inventive compounds and NAALADase. "IC.sub.50 " is a related term used to define the concentration or amount of a compound which is required to cause a 50% inhibition of the target enzyme.</p><p>"Ischemia" refers to localized tissue anemia due to obstruction of the inflow of arterial blood. Global ischemia occurs when blood flow to the entire brain ceases for a period of time, such as may result from cardiac arrest. Focal ischemia occurs when a portion of the brain is deprived of its normal blood supply, such as may result from thromboembolytic occlusion of a cerebral vessel, traumatic head injury, edema or brain tumor. Even if transient, both global and focal ischemia can produce widespread neuronal damage. Although nerve tissue damage occurs over hours or even days following the onset of ischemia, some permanent nerve tissue damage may develop in the initial minutes following cessation of blood flow to the brain. Much of this damage is attributed to glutamate toxicity and secondary consequences of reperfusion of the tissue, such as the release of vasoactive products by damaged endothelium, and the release of cytotoxic products, such as free radicals and leukotrienes, by the damaged tissue.</p><p>"Isomers" refer to compounds having the same number and kind of atoms, and hence the same molecular weight, but differing in respect to the arrangement or configuration of the atoms. "Stereoisomers" are isomers that differ only in the arrangement of the atoms in space. "Enantiomers" are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. "Diastereoisomers" are stereoisomers which are not mirror images of each other. "Racemic mixture" means a mixture containing equal parts of individual enantiomers. "Non-racemic mixture" is a mixture containing unequal parts of individual enantiomers or stereoisomers.</p><p>"NAAG" refers to N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate, an important peptide component of the brain, with levels comparable to the major inhibitor neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). NAAG is neuron-specific, present in synaptic vesicles and released upon neuronal stimulation in several systems presumed to be glutamatergic. Studies suggest that NAAG may function as a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in the central nervous system, or as a precursor of the neurotransmitter glutamate.</p><p>"NAALADase" refers to N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase, a membrane-bound metallopeptidase which catabolizes NAAG to N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate: ##STR2## NAALADase shows a high affinity for NAAG with a Km of 540 nM. If NAAG is a bioactive peptide, then NAALADase may serve to inactivate NAAG'S synaptic action.</p><p>Alternatively, if NAAG functions as a precursor for glutamate, the primary function of NAALADase may be to regulate synaptic glutamate availability.</p><p>"Nervous function" refers to the various functions of the nervous system, which among other things provide an awareness of the internal and external environments of the body, make possible voluntary and reflex activities between the various structural elements of the organism, and balance the organism's response to environmental changes.</p><p>"Nervous insult" refers to any damage to nervous tissue and any disability or death resulting therefrom. The cause of nervous insult may be metabolic, toxic, neurotoxic, iatrogenic, thermal or chemical, and includes without limitation ischemia, hypoxia, cerebrovascular accident, trauma, surgery, pressure, mass effect, hemorrhage, radiation, vasospasm, neurodegenerative disease, neurodegenerative process, infection, Parkinson's disease, ALS, myelination/demyelination process, epilepsy, cognitive disorder, glutamate abnormality and secondary effects thereof. Currently, there is no known effective treatment for nervous tissue damage.</p><p>"Nervous tissue" refers to the various components that make up the nervous system, including without limitation neurons, neural support cells, glia, Schwann cells, vasculature contained within and supplying these structures, the central nervous system, the brain, the brain stem, the spinal cord, the junction of the central nervous system with the peripheral nervous system, the peripheral nervous system and allied structures.</p><p>"Neuroprotective" refers to the effect of reducing, arresting or ameliorating nervous insult, and protecting, resuscitating or reviving nervous tissue which has suffered nervous insult.</p><p>"Pathological gambling" is a condition characterized by a preoccupation with gambling. Similar to psychoactive substance abuse, its effects include development of tolerance with a need to gamble progressively larger amounts of money, withdrawal symptoms, and continued gambling despite severe negative effects on family and occupation.</p><p>"Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt of the inventive compounds which possesses the desired pharmacological activity and which is neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable. The salt can be formed with inorganic acids such as acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Examples of a base salt include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine and lysine. The basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quarternized with agents including lower alkyl halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates such as dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aralkyl halides such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides.</p><p>"Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" refers to a derivative of the inventive compounds which undergoes biotransformation prior to exhibiting its pharmacological effect(s). The prodrug is formulated with the objective(s) of improved chemical stability, improved patient acceptance and compliance, improved bioavailability, prolonged duration of action, improved organ selectivity, improved formulation (e.g., increased hydrosolubility), and/or decreased side effects (e.g., toxicity). The prodrug can be readily prepared from the inventive compounds using methods known in the art, such as those described by Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Chemistry, Fifth Ed., Vol. 1, pp. 172-178, 949-982 (1995). For example, the inventive compounds can be transformed into prodrugs by converting one or more of the hydroxy or carboxy groups into esters.</p><p>"Tourette's syndrome" refers to an autosomal multiple tic disorder characterized by compulsive swearing, multiple muscle tics and loud noises. Tics are brief, rapid, involuntary movements that can be simple or complex; they are stereotyped and repetitive, but not rhythmic. Simple tics, such as eye blinking, often begin as nervous mannerisms.

Pump means, particularly subcutaneous pump means, are preferred for continuous infusion.</p><heading>DOSAGE</heading><p>Dose levels on the order of about 0.1 mg to about 10,000 mg of the active ingredient compound are useful in the treatment of the above conditions, with preferred levels being about 0.1 mg to about 1,000 mg. The specific dose level for any particular patient will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the rate of excretion; drug combination; the severity of the particular disease being treated; and the form of administration. Typically, in vitro dosage-effect results provide useful guidance on the proper doses for patient administration. Studies in animal models are also helpful. The considerations for determining the proper dose levels are well known in the art.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are administered in lyophilized form. In this case, 1 to 100 mg of a compound of the present invention may be lyophilized in individual vials, together with a carrier and a buffer, such as mannitol and sodium phosphate. The compound may be reconstituted in the vials with bacteriostatic water before administration.</p><p>In treating global ischemia, the compounds of the present invention are preferably administered orally, rectally, parenterally or topically at least 1 to 6 times daily, and may follow an initial bolus dose of higher concentration.</p><p>The compounds of the present invention may be administered in combination with one or more therapeutic agents, including chemotherapeutic agents. TABLE I provides known median dosages for selected chemotherapeutic agents. Specific dose levels for these agents and other therapeutic agents will depend upon considerations such as those identified above for the compounds of the present invention.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE I______________________________________CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT                 MEDIAN DOSAGE______________________________________Asparaginase          10,000 units  Bleomycin Sulfate 15 units  Carboplatin 50-450 mg  Carmustine 100 mg  Cisplatin 10-50 mg  Cladribine 10 mg  Cyclophosphamide 100 mg-2 gm  (lyophilized)  Cyclophosphamide (non- 100 mg-2 gm  lyophilized)  Cytarabine (lyophilized 100 mg-2 gm  powder)  Dacarbazine 100 mg-200 mg  Dactinomycin 0.5 mg  Daunorubicin 20 mg  Diethylstilbestrol 250 mg  Doxorubicin 10-150 mg  Etidronate 300 mg  Etoposide 100 mg  Floxuridine 500 mg  Fludarabine Phosphate 50 mg  Fluorouracil 500 mg-5 gm  Goserelin 3.6 mg  Granisetron Hydrochloride 1 mg  Idarubicin 5-10 mg  Ifosfamide 1-3 gm  Leucovorin Calcium 50-350 mg  Leuprolide 3.75-7.5 mg  Mechlorethamine 10 mg  Medroxyprogesterone 1 gm  Melphalan 50 gm  Methotrexate 20 mg-1 gm  Mitomycin 5-40 mg  Mitoxantrone 20-30 mg  Ondansetron Hydrochloride 40 mg  Paclitaxel 30 mg  Pamidronate Disodium 30-*90 mg  Pegaspargase 750 units  Plicamycin 2,500 mcgm  Streptozocin 1 gm  Thiotepa 15 mg  Teniposide 50 mg  Vinblastine 10 mg  Vincristine 1-5 mg  Aldesleukin 22 million units  Epoetin Alfa 2,000-10,000 units  Filgrastim 300-480 mcgm  Immune Globulin 500 mg-10 gm  Interferon Alpha-2a 3-36 million units  Interferon Alpha-2b 3-50 million units  Levamisole 50 mg  Octreotide 1,000-5,000 mcgm  Sargramostim 250-500 mcgm______________________________________</pre></p><heading>ADMINISTRATION REGIMEN</heading><p>For the methods of the present invention, any administration regimen regulating the timing and sequence of drug delivery can be used and repeated as necessary to effect treatment. Such regimen may include pretreatment and/or co-administration with additional therapeutic agents.</p><p>To maximize protection of nervous tissue from nervous insult, the compounds should be administered to the affected cells as soon as possible. In situations where nervous insult is anticipated, the compounds should be administered before the expected nervous insult. Such situations of increased likelihood of nervous insult include surgery (cartoid endarterectomy, cardiac, vascular, aortic, orthopedic); endovascular procedures such as arterial catherization (cartoid, vertebral, aortic, cardia, renal, spinal, Adamkiewicz); injections of embolic agents; coils or balloons for hemostasis; interruptions of vascularity for treatment of brain lesions; and predisposing medical conditions such as crescendo transient ischemic attacks, emboli and sequential strokes. Where pretreatment for stroke or ischemia is impossible or impracticable, it is important to get the compounds to the affected cells as soon as possible during or after the event. In the time period between strokes, diagnosis and treatment procedures should be minimized to save the cells from further damage and death.</p><p>For patients with prostate cancer that is neither advanced nor metastatic, the compounds of the present invention may be administered (i) prior to surgery or radiation treatment to reduce the risk of metastasis; (ii) during surgery or in conjunction with radiation treatment; and/or (iii) after surgery or radiation therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and to inhibit the growth of any residual tumorous cells.</p><p>For patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, the compounds of the present invention may be administered as a continuous supplement to, or as a replacement for, hormonal ablation in order to slow tumor cell growth in both the untreated primary tumor and the existing metastatic lesions.</p><p>The methods of the present invention are particularly useful where shed cells could not be removed by surgical intervention. After post-surgical recovery, the methods of the present invention would be effective in reducing the chances of recurrence of a tumor engendered by such shed cells.</p><heading>COMBINATION WITH OTHER TREATMENTS</heading><p>a. Nervous Insult</p><p>In methods of treating nervous insult (particularly acute ischemic stroke and global ischemia caused by drowning and head trauma), the compounds of the present invention can be co-administered with one or more therapeutic agents, preferably agents which can reduce the risk of stroke (such as aspirin), and more preferably agents which can reduce the risk of a second ischemic event (such as ticlopidine).</p><p>The compounds of the present invention can be co-administered with one or more therapeutic agents either (i) together in a single formulation, or (ii) separately in individual formulations designed for optimal release rates of their respective active agent. Each formulation may contain from about 0.01% to about 99.99% by weight, preferably from about 3.5% to about 60% by weight, of a compound of the present invention, as well as one or more pharmaceutical excipients, such as wetting, emulsifying and pH buffering agents.</p><p>b. Prostate Disease</p><p>(i) Surgery and Radiation Treatment</p><p>In general, surgery and radiation treatment are employed as potentially curative therapies for patients with localized prostate cancer who are under 70 years of age and are expected to live at least 10 more years.</p><p>Approximately 70% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients fall into this category. Approximately 90% of these patients (65% of total patients) undergo surgery, while approximately 10% of these patients (7% of total patients) undergo radiation treatment.</p><p>Histopathological examination of surgical specimens reveals that approximately 63% of patients undergoing surgery (40% of total patients) have locally extensive tumors or regional (lymph node) metastasis that was undetected at initial diagnosis. These patients are at a significantly greater risk of recurrence. Approximately 40% of these patients will actually develop recurrence within five years after surgery. Results after radiation treatment are even less encouraging. Approximately 80% of patients who have undergone radiation treatment as their primary therapy have disease persistence or develop recurrence or metastasis within five years after treatment.</p><p>Currently, most prostate cancer patients undergoing surgery and radiation treatment do not receive any immediate follow-up therapy. Rather, they are monitored frequently for elevated Prostate Specific Antigen ("PSA"), which is the primary indicator of recurrence or metastasis.</p><p>Based on the above statistics, there is considerable opportunity to use the present invention in conjunction with surgery and/or radiation treatment.</p><p>(ii) Hormonal Therapy</p><p>Hormonal ablation is the most effective palliative treatment for the 10% of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Hormonal ablation by medication and/or orchiectomy is used to block hormones that promote further growth and metastasis of prostate cancer. With time, both the primary and metastatic tumors of virtually all of these patients become hormone-independent and resistant to therapy. Approximately 50% of patients with metastatic cancer die within three years after initial diagnosis, and 75% of such patients die within five years after diagnosis. Continuous supplementation with the compounds of the present invention may be used to prevent or reverse this potentially metastasis-permissive state.</p><p>(iii) Chemotherapy</p><p>While chemotherapy has been successful in treating some forms of cancer, it has shown slight therapeutic value in treating prostate cancer where it is generally reserved as a last resort. Accordingly, the opportunity to treat prostate cancer by combining chemotherapy with the methods of the present invention will be rare. When combined, however, such treatments should be more effective than chemotherapy alone in controlling prostate cancer.</p><p>(iv) Immunotherapy</p><p>The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with monoclonal antibodies to treat prostate cancer. Such combined treatment is particularly effective for patients with pelvic lymph node involvement, of which only 34% survive after 5 years. An example of such monoclonal antibodies is cell membrane-specific anti-prostate antibody.</p><p>The present invention may also be used with immunotherapies based on polyclonal or monoclonal antibody-derived reagents. Monoclonal antibody-derived reagents are preferred. These reagents are well known in the art, and include radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies conjugated with strontium-89.</p><p>(v) Cryotherapy</p><p>The methods of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with cryotherapy for treatment of prostate cancer.</p><p>In Vivo Toxicity of NAALADase Inhibitors</p><p>To examine the toxicological effect of NAALADase inhibition in vivo, a group of mice were injected with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid, a NAALADase inhibitor of high activity, in doses of 1, 5, 10, 30, 100, 300 and 500 mg/kg body weight. The mice were subsequently observed two times per day for 5 consecutive days. The survival rate at each dose level is provided below in TABLE II. The results show that the NAALADase inhibitor is non-toxic to mice, suggesting that it would be similarly non-toxic to humans when administered at therapeutically effective amounts.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE II______________________________________TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NAALADASE INHIBITORS______________________________________Dose   1       5       10    30    100   300  500  (mg/kg)  Survival 100 100 100 100 100 100 66.7  Rate After  5 days (%)______________________________________</pre></p><p>In Vitro Inhibition of NAALADase Activity</p><p>Various compounds of formula I were tested for in vitro inhibition of NAALADase activity.

See TABLE VIII for the Dissociated Culture Protocol as used herein. Fetuses of embryonic day 17 are removed from timed pregnancy rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley). The cortex is rapidly dissected out in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, stripped of meninges, and incubated in a papain solution for 15 minutes at 37 C. The tissue is then mechanically triturated and pelleted at 500 g (1000-2000 rpm on swinging bucket Beckman). The pellet is resuspended in a DNAase solution, triturated with a 10 ml pipette x15-20, layered over a "10 VIII for an example of a "10 resuspended in a plating medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone A-1111-L), 5% heat-inactivated Equine serum (HyClone A-3311-L), and 84% modified Earle's basal medium (MEM) (Gibco 51200-020) with high glucose (4.5 g/L), and 1 g/L NaHCO.sub.3.

Ischemic Insult using potassium cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose</p><p>Twenty-one to twenty-four days following the initial cortical cell plating, the experiment is performed. The cultures are washed three times in HEPES buffered saline solution containing no phosphate. The cultures are then exposed to potassium cyanide (KCN) (5 mM) and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) (10 mM) for 20 minutes at 37 previously to induce maximal toxicity (Vornov et al., J. Neurochem, Vol. 65, No. 4, pp. 1681-1691 (1995)). At the end of 24 hours, the cultures are analyzed for release of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a standard measure of cell lysis. LDH measurements are performed according to the method of Koh and Choi, J. Neuroscience Methods (1987).</p><p>c. NAAG Induced Neurotoxicity</p><p>Cultures are assessed microscopically and those with uniform neuronal densities are used in the NAAG neurotoxicity trials.</p><p>At the time of the experiment, the cultures are washed once in HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS; NaCl 143.4 mM, HEPES 5 mM, KCl 5.4 nM, MgSO.sub.4 1.2 mM, NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 1.2 mM, CaCl.sub.2 2.0 mM, D-glucose 10 mM) (Vornov et al., 1995) and then exposed to various concentrations of NAAG for 20 minutes at 37 range from 3 μM to 3 mM, and include 3 μM, 10 μM, 30 μM, 100 μM, 300 μM, 1 mM, and 3 mM. At the end of exposure, the cells are washed once with HEPES buffered saline solution and then replaced with serum free modified Earle's basal medium. The cultures are then returned to the CO.sub.2 incubator for 24 hour recovery.</p><p>d. Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay</p><p>Release of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a standard measure of cell lysis, is used to quantify injury (Koh and Choi, 1987). LDH-activity measurements are normalized to control for variability between culture preparations (Koh and Choi, 1987). Each independent experiment contains a control condition in which no NAALADase inhibitors are added; a small amount of LDH activity is found in these controls. This control measurement is subtracted from each experimental point. These values are normalized within each experiment as a percentage of the injury caused by NAAG/ischemia. Only main effects of NAALADase inhibitors are considered; interactions between dose and condition are not examined statistically.</p><p>A measurement of the potency of each compound tested is made by measuring the percentage of LDH release into the growth media after exposure to NAAG/ischemia plus NAALADase inhibitor or NAAG/ischemia plus saline (control). Since high concentrations of glutamate may be toxic to cells in certain circumstances, measurement of glutamate toxicity is observed using LDH as a standard measurement technique.</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Cortical Injury Following MCAO in SHRSP Rats</p><p>To examine the effect of NAALADase inhibitors on cortical injury in vivo, the infarct volume was measured in SHRSP rats which had sustained middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and had subsequently been treated with (i) saline; (ii) 10 mg/kg of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid followed by 2 mg/kg/hr of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid for 1 hour; or (iii) 100 mg/kg of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid followed by 20 mg/kg/hr of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid for one hour.</p><p>The cortical injury volume for each group of rats is provided below in TABLE IX and graphically presented in FIG. 5.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE IX______________________________________Cortical Injury Volume (mm.sup.3).+-.S.E.M.

All rats are kept in a virus-free environment and maintained on regular diet (NIH 31, Zeigler Bros, Inc.) with water ad libitum. All groups of rats are allowed to eat and drink water until the morning of the experiment.</p><p>Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is induced by advancing a 4-0 surgical nylon suture into the internal carotid artery (ICA) to block the origin of the MCA (Koizumi, 1986; Longa, 1989; Chen, 1992). The rats are anesthetized with 4% halothane, and maintained with 1.0% to 1.5% halothane in air enriched oxygen using a face mask. Rectal temperature is maintained at 37+-50 surgical procedure using a heating lamp. The right femoral artery is cannulated for measuring blood gases (pH, oxygen tension [PO.sub.2 ], carbon dioxide tension [PCO.sub.2 ]) before and during ischemia, for monitoring blood pressure during the surgery. The right common carotid artery (CCA) is exposed through a midline incision; a self-retraining retractor is positioned between the digastric and mastoid muscles, and the omohyoid muscle is divided. The right external carotid artery (ECA) is dissected and ligated. The occipital artery branch of the ECA is then isolated and coagulated. Next, the right internal carotid artery (ICA) is isolated until the pterygopalatine artery is exposed, and carefully separated from the adjacent vagus nerve. The pterygopalatine artery is ligated with 4-0 silk suture close to its origin.</p><p>After the CCA is ligated with 4-0 silk suture, a 4-0 silk suture to prevent bleeding from a puncture site, through which a 2.5 cm length of 4-0 monofilament nylon suture (Ethilon), its tip rounded by heating near a electric cautery, is introduced into the ICA lumen. A 6-0 silk suture is tightened around the intraluminal nylon suture at the bifurcation to prevent bleeding, and the stretched sutures at the CCA and the ICA are released. The nylon suture is then gently advanced as far as 20 mm.</p><p>Anesthesia is terminated after 10 minutes of MCA occlusion in both groups, and the rats were awakened 5 minutes thereafter. After 2 hours of ischemia, anesthesia is reanesthetized, and reperfusion is performed by withdrawing the intraluminal nylon suture until the distal tip became visible at the origin of the ICA.</p><p>Arterial pH and PaCO.sub.2, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO.sub.2) are measured with a self-calibrating Radiometer electrode system (ABL 3; Copenhagen, Denmark). Hemoglobin and arterial oxygen content are measured with a hemoximeter (Radiometer, Model OSM3; Copenhagen, Denmark). Blood glucose is measured with a glucose analyzer (model 2300A, Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio).</p><p>Each group is exposed to 2 hours of right MCA occlusion and 22 hours of reperfusion. All variables but the rectal temperature are measured at baseline, at 15 minutes and 45 minutes of right MCA occlusion. The rectal temperature is measured at baseline, at 0 and 15 min of MCA occlusion, and at 0 and 22 hours of reperfusion.</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Brain Injury Following MCAO in Sprague-Dawley Rats</p><p>To examine the neuroprotective effect of NAALADase inhibitors on brain injury in vivo, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a vehicle or 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid before and after sustaining a 2 hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In the control group (n=8), the rats received an IP injection of saline 30 minutes post-occlusion followed by IV saline infusion at a rate of 0.5 ml/hr. In the drug treated groups, the rats received an IP injection of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid at a dose of 100 mg/kg at 20 minutes pre-occlusion (n=5), 30 minutes post-occlusion (n=9), 60 minutes post-occlusion (n=7), or 120 minutes post-occlusion (n=4), followed by a 20 mg/kg/hr IV infusion for 4 hours (infusion rate=0.5 ml/hr). There was a 15 minute delay between IP and IV treatments for each rat. Twenty two hours following the reperfusion, the rats were euthanized and their brains were removed. Seven coronal sections (2 mm thick) were taken and stained with 1% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetraxolium chloride (TTC) for 20 minutes and then fixed in 10% formalin. The anterior and posterior surface of the most rostral brain section and the posterior surface of each of the other 6 sections were imaged. The quantification of infarct size of each brain was obtained using a computer aided-digital imaging analysis system (LOATS). The brain regions completely lacking TTC-staining were characterized as representative of infarcted tissue. The total infarct volume for each rat was calculated by numeric integration of the respective sequential brain areas.</p><p>The total infarct volume for each group of rats is graphically presented in FIG. 6.</p><p>Vehicle treated rats exhibited a mean total brain infarct volume of 293.+-.26 mm.sup.3. Rats treated with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid either before or after the ischemic insult exhibited significantly lower mean total brain infarct volumes of 122.+-.26 mm.sup.3 (p=0.003 vs. vehicle) for 20 minute pre-treatment, 208.+-.40 mm.sup.3 (p=0.2 vs. vehicle) for 30 minute post-treatment, 125.+-.57 mm.sup.3 (p=0.015 vs. vehicle) for 60 minute post-treatment, and 133.+-.35 mm.sup.3 (p=0.005 vs. vehicle) for 120 minute post-treatment. These results indicate that 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid is neuroprotective in rat MCAO model of stroke when administered up to 2 hours post-occlusion.</p><p>Protocol for In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Brain Injury</p><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (260-320 g) were used. Prior to the experiment, the rats were individually housed and allowed free access to food and water. Each rat received two surgeries: jugular vein cannulation for IV infusion and MCAO. During surgeries, the rat was anesthetized with 2% halothane delivered in oxygen via an inhalation mask. The body temperature was monitored and regulated at normothermic level using a homeothermic heating system. First, a PE-50 polyethylene catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein. One hour later, the rat was reanesthetized for MCAO surgery. The MCAO was achieved using the endovascular suture method described by Long et al., Stroke, Vol. 20, pp. 84-91 (1989). Specifically, the right external carotid artery (ECA) was exposed, coagulated and transected. A 3-0 monofilament nylon suture with a blunted tip was introduced into the proximal stump of the ECA via an arteriotomy and advanced 20 mm from the carotid bifurcation until it lodged in the proximal region of the anterior cerebral artery, thereby occluding the origin of the MCA. The rats were allowed to wake up; 2 hours later, the rats were reanesthetized for reperfusion, during which the nylon suture was retracted to the stump of the ECA allowing blood recirculation to the MCA.</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Stroke-Induced Rise in Brain Glutamate Levels</p><p>To examine the effect of NAALADase inhibitors on hyperglutamatergic disorders in vivo, rats with stroke-induced rise in brain glutamate levels were treated with a vehicle or 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid.</p><p>The results are graphically presented in FIGS. 7, 8 and 9.</p><p>The results show that 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid treatment (100 mg/kg IP followed by 20 mg/kg/hr IV) significantly attenuated stroke-induced extracellular glutamate increases in the striatum (FIG. 7) as compared to vehicle treated rats (p&amp;lt;0.05), and completely prevented concurrent glutamate changes in the parietal cortex (p&amp;lt;0.01; FIG. 8). In contrast, there was no significant effect of the stroke itself on glutamate in the frontal cortex and no subsequent difference between the vehicle and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid treated groups (FIG. 9). Values are expressed as % baseline where baseline constitutes the mean of three consecutive 20 minute samples preceding stroke. Absolute basal (pretreatment) values for glutamate (mean.+-.SEM) in caudate, parietal and frontal cortices were 0.25+0.1, 1.1+0.3 and 0.6+0.1 μM, respectively, in the vehicle treated rats, and 0.46+0.1, 2.0+0.7 and 0.9+0.3 μM, respectively, in the 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid treated rats.</p><p>Protocol for In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Stroke-Induced Rise in Brain Glutamate Levels</p><p>Male Sprague Dawley rats (270-330 g, n=5-6 per group) were implanted with concentric microdialysis probes similar to previously described procedures (Britton et al., J. Neurochem., Vol. 67, pp. 324-329 (1996)). In brief, under halothane anaesthesia, probes (constructed in-house using Cuprophane capillary membrane; 10K mw cut off; 2 mm dialyzing length) were implanted into the frontal cortex (AP=+3.5; ML=3; DIV=3), caudate nucleus (AP=0; ML=3; DV=6.6), and parietal cortex (AP=-2; ML=5; DV=3) (coordinates in mm relative to bregma and dura, respectively), regions believed to represent core and penumbral areas of ischemia-induced injury. Glutamate levels in dialysate were determined using precolumn o-phthaldialdehyde derivatization, followed by HPLC with fluorometric detection.</p><p>Approximately 20 hours after probe implantation, the rats were dialyzed with perfusion fluid (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.18 mM MgCl.sub.2 and 1.26 mM CaCl.sub.2) at a rate of 2.5 μl/min. Following a 60 minute stabilization period, dialysis samples were collected every 20 minutes. After collecting 3 baseline samples, the rats were anaesthetized with halothane and subjected to temporary ischemia using the filament method of MCAO (Britton et al., Life Sciences, Vol. 60, No. 20, pp. 1729-1740 (1997)). In brief, the right external carotid artery (ECA) was exposed and its branches coagulated. A 3-0 monofilament nylon suture was introduced into the internal carotid artery via an arteriotomy in the ECA and advanced until it lodged in the proximal region of the anterior cerebral artery, thus occluding the origin of the MCA. The endovascular suture was retracted to allow reperfusion 2 hours after occlusion.</p><p>Body temperature was maintained normothermic throughout stroke surgery and reperfusion procedures. The rats were dosed IP with 100 mg/kg 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid at -20 minute pre-occlusion and IV with 20 mg/kg/hr for 4 hours at the time of occlusion. Dialysis samples were collected every 20 minutes from unanesthetized rats. Following 24 hours of reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed, their brains were removed, and 7 coronal sections (2 mm thick) were taken from the region beginning 1 mm from the frontal pole and ending just rostral to the cortico-cerebellar junction. Analysis of ischemic cerebral damage was achieved using TTC staining and computer assisted image analysis as described by Britton et al. (1997), supra.</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Myelin Formation Following Sciatic Nerve Cryolesion</p><p>It was recently demonstrated that NAALADase is down-regulated in glial cells as they start to form myelin and is absent in myelinating Schwann cells. Based on this data, the inventors hypothesized that inhibition of NAALADase may affect the signaling mechanism between axons and Schwann cells and result in increasing myelination. To test this hypothesis, the inventors examined the effect of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid on nerve regeneration and myelination following cryolesion of the sciatic nerve in male mice.</p><p>The results are provided below in TABLE X and graphically presented in FIG. 10(a) and FIG. 10(b).</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE X______________________________________IN VIVO EFFECT OF NAALADASE INHIBITORS ON MYELIN  FORMATION FOLLOWING SCIATIC NERVE CRYOLESION         2-(phosphonomethyl)-  pentanedioic acid vehicle______________________________________ratio of # of 1.5  myelinated axons  (drug/vehicle)  # of myelinated 16.53 .+-. 0.65 13.77 .+-. 0.09  lamellae  (ave. + SEM)  % increase of 20%  myelinated lamellae  over vehicle  significance by p &amp;lt; 0.005  t-test______________________________________</pre></p><p>As detailed in FIG. 10(a) and FIG. 10(b), both light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination of the nerve 3 mm distal to the site of cryolesion demonstrated a significant increase in the number of myelinated axons (1.5-fold increase) and myelin thickness (20% increase, p&amp;lt;0.005), as compared to nerves in mice treated with vehicle.</p><p>FIG. 10(a) and FIG. 10(b) show a photomicrograph of this effect.

In brief, each mouse was anesthetized and its sciatic nerve was exposed in the upper thigh and cryolesioned using a copper cryode (diameter=0.5 mm) that was dipped in liquid nitrogen and repeatedly applied to the upper part of the nerve. The extent of the lesion was approximately 1 mm.</p><p>2-(Phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid was incorporated into silicone strips according to the method of Connold et al., Developmental Brain Res, Vol. 28, pp. 99-104 (1986), and was implanted at the site of cryolesion on day 0 and replaced on days 3, 6, 9 and 12. Approximately 2.5 μg/day of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid was released from the silicone implants each day. Both right and left sciatic nerves of each mouse were lesioned; right-side nerves were treated with silicone implant strips containing vehicle alone while left-side nerves were treated with silicone implants containing 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid. Fifteen days after surgery, the mice were sacrificed and their sciatic nerve segments were collected and processed for light microscopy and TEM analysis. Randomly chosen fields 2-3 mm distal to the lesion were qualitatively analyzed by light microscopy using 1-micrometer-thick toluidine blue stained cross sections and photographic images were captured.</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Parkinson's Disease</p><p>To examine the effect of NAALADase inhibitors on Parkinson's Disease in vivo, MPTP lesioned mice were treated with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid or a vehicle.</p><p>The percent of dopaminergic neurons for each group of mice is provided below in TABLE XI and graphically presented in FIG. 11.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE XI______________________________________IN VIVO EFFECT OF NAALADASE INHIBITORS ON  PARKINSON'S DISEASE                Percent Strial TH  Innervation Density  (mean .+-.

In brief, spinal subarachnoid injections were delivered using 30-gauge needles inserted between the L4-L5 vertebrae of male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g). The rats were anesthetized with halothane and dorsal midline incisions were made immediately rostral to the pelvic girdle. By using the vertebral processes as guides, the needle was advanced to pass into the subarachnoid space surrounding the cauda equina. Correct needle placement was verified by CSF flow from the needle after its insertion. Injections were delivered using a Hamilton microsyringe in a total volume of 20 μl which contained dynorphin (20 nmol), the cannula flush and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid or vehicle. After injections, the incisions were treated with the topical antibacterial furazolidone and closed with wound clips.

At the end of this period, cultures were collected assayed for ChAT activity as described below.</p><p>CHAT Assays</p><p>To determine choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) activity, the spinal cord tissues in each dish (five slices) were pooled and frozen (-75 until assay. CHAT activity was measured radiometrically by described methods using [.sup.3 H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham; Fonnum, 1975). Protein content of tissue homogenate was determined by a Coomassi Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.).</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Ethanol Consumption in Alcohol-Preferring Rats</p><p>To test the effect of NAALADase inhibitors on ethanol consumption, alcohol-preferring rats were treated with saline or a 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg dose of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid prior to ethanol access. The ethanol intake of the rats following treatment is graphically presented in FIG. 15.</p><p>As shown in FIG. 15, the 200 mg/kg dose of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid exhibited no effect, whereas both the 50 and 100 mg/kg doses significantly reduced ethanol consumption by approximately 25% (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 1 hour access period. Body weights and 24 hour water intakes were not altered at any of the 3 doses. If 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid is acting centrally, these data suggest that NAALADase may be involved in neuronal systems regulating alcohol-drinking behavior.</p><p>Saline Baseline: 8.9.+-7</p><p>200 mg/kg 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid: 8.+-5</p><p>Saline Baseline: 7.8.+-8</p><p>100 mg/kg 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid: 5.8.+-7</p><p>Saline Baseline: 8.1.+-6</p><p>50 mg/kg 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid: 6.2.+-9</p><p>Protocol for In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Ethanol Consumption in Alcohol-Preferring Rats</p><p>The effect of systemic administration of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid was examined on ethanol intake in the alcohol-preferring (P) line of rats, as described by Panocka et al., Pharm. Biochem. and Behavior, Vol. 52, No. 2, pp. 255-259 (1995) and Murphy et al., Alcohol, Vol. 2, pp. 349-352 (1985). In brief, 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg IP) was tested in female P rats (n=8) given daily 1 hour scheduled access to a 10% (v/v) ethanol solution. A within-subject design was used where 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid treatments were tested once per week. Baseline ethanol drinking consisted of the mean of the 3 days prior to testing in which saline injections were given. 2-(Phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid or saline, administered IP in 1 ml/kg volumes, were injected 10-15 minutes prior to ethanol access. 24 hour water and daily body weights were recorded to assess non-specific drug effects. Results were analyzed using paired t-tests with baseline and test day values serving as the independent variables. Ethanol intake was recorded as amount of solution consumed (mls).</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Nicotine Self-Administration in Male Long-Evans Rats</p><p>To test the effect of NAALADase inhibitors on nicotine self-administration, male Long-Evans rats trained to self-administer nicotine were treated with a 200 mg/kg dose of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid prior to nicotine access. The cumulative nicotine intake of the rats following treatment is graphically presented in FIG. 16.</p><p>The results show that the 200 mg/kg dose of 2-(phosphonomethyl) pentanedioic acid reduced nicotine self-administration from 23 to 5 infusions during the 1 hour access period. As graphically presented in FIG. 17, the cumulative food intake of the rats also decreased during the same period of time. While these data suggest that factors other than 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid may be responsible for the reduction in nicotine self-administration, they do not disprove NAALADase's involvement in the neuronal systems regulating nicotine use. The effect on the rats' food intake could be attributed to toxicity caused by an excessive drug dose.</p><p>Protocol for In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Nicotine Self-Administration in Male Long-Evans Rats</p><p>Male Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer nicotine on a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement, as described by Corrigall et al., Psychopharmacology, Vol. 104, No. 2, pp. 171-176 (1991) and Corrigall et al., Psychopharmacology, Vol. 107, Nos. 2-3, pp. 285-289 (1992). In brief, male Long-Evans rats were food deprived for a short period of time (24-48 hours) and trained to press a lever in an operant responding chamber on an FR-1 schedule of food reinforcement. Once trained, each rat was surgically prepared with a chronic intravenous catheter implanted into the jugular vein. The rats were allowed 1 week to recover from surgery.</p><p>After 1 week, nicotine self-administration studies were initiated on an FR-1 with a 60 second signaled time-out following each infusion. During time-out, responding on the lever had no scheduled consequence. Nicotine self-administration sessions were 60 minutes in duration. Each nicotine infusion contained 30 μg of nicotine/kg rat and were delivered in a volume of 54 μl over an infusion duration of 0.3 seconds. 15 minutes before the self-administration sessions, the rats were pre-treated intraperitoneally with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid at doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg. Food intake was monitored during the nicotine self-administration sessions to assess non-specific drug effects.</p><p>In Vitro Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Cancer</p><p>To examine the effect of NAALADase inhibitors on cancer cell line, LNCaP cells (a prostate cancer cell line) were treated with quisqualate acid (in concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 1 μM) and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (in concentrations ranging from 100 pM to 10 nM). The 3H-thymidine measurement for each concentration of quisqualate acid and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid is provided in TABLE XIV below and graphically represented in FIG. 18 and FIG. 19, respectively.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE XIV______________________________________   3H-Thymidine Incorporation (dpm/well)                 2-(phosphonomethyl)-  Dose Quisqualic Acid pentanedioic acid______________________________________Control   4813 .+-. 572                 4299 .+-. 887  10 pM --  3078 .+-. 1006  100 pM -- 2062 .+-. 595  1 nM 3668 .+-. 866 1001 .+-. 52  10 nM 2137 .+-. 764  664 .+-. 366  100 nM 1543 .+-. 312 --  1 μM 1295 .+-. 181 --______________________________________</pre></p><p>The results show that LNCaP cell proliferation (as measured by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine) decreased significantly as the concentration of the NAALADase inhibitors increased, suggesting that the compounds of the present invention would be effective in treating cancer, particularly prostate cancer.</p><p>Protocol for In Vitro Cancer Assay</p><p>Cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) are plated in 24 well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 hours before addition of quisqualic acid (10.sup.-9 to 10.sup.-6) or 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (10.sup.-11 to 10.sup.-8) for 7 days. On the 7th day, the cells are pulsed with 3H-thymidine for 4 hours, harvested and measured for radioactivity. Values represent means +/- SEM of 6 separate cell wells for each treatment. All experiments are performed at least twice.</p><p>To control for non-specific cytostatic effects of quisqualate acid and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid, the agents are simultaneously evaluated on a non-NAALADase containing prostate cell line, DU145 (Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (93) 749-753, 1996). If the treatments with quisqualate acid and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic have no significant effect on cell growth, the NAALADase inhibiting activity of the agents are uniquely responsible for their cytostatic effects on prostate carcinoma cell lines.</p><p>Cell Lines and Tissue Culture</p><p>LNCaP cells are obtained from Dr. William Nelson at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md. DU145 cells are obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). Cells are grown in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Paragon) in a humidified incubator at 37 air atmosphere.</p><p>[3H] Thymidine Incorporation Assays</p><p>The cells are suspended at 1 seeded into 24-well plates at 500 μl per well.

Med. Chem., Vol. 39, No. 2, pp. 619-622, is added to the wells and the plates are returned to the incubator. On days 3, 5 and 7, media and drug are refreshed. On the 8th day following seeding, each well is pulsed with 1 μCi .sup.3 H-thymidine (New England Nuclear) for 4 hours. Media is then removed and the wells washed 2 times with phosphate buffered saline (pH=7.4). The contents of each well is subsequently solubilized 250 μl of 0.2 N NaOH and transferred to scintillation vials. 5 ml UltimaGold (Packard) scintillation cocktail is added and radioactivity is quantitated using a Beckman LS6001 scintillation counter.</p><p>The purity and/or identity of all synthetic compounds is ascertained by thin layer chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra are obtained using a Bruker spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is conducted on prelayered silica gel GHLF plates (Analtech, Newark, Del.). Visualization of the plates is accomplished by using UV light, phosphomolybdic acid-ethanol, and/or iodoplatinate charring. Flash chromatography is conducted on Kieselgel 60, 230-400 mesh (E. Merck, Darmstadt, West Germany). Solvents are either reagent or HPLC grade. Reactions are run at ambient temperature and under a nitrogen atmosphere unless otherwise noted. Solutions are evaporated under reduced pressure on a Buchi rotary evaporator.</p><p>In Vivo Assay of NAALADase Inhibitors on Cancer</p><p>To examine the effect of NAALADase inhibitors on cancer in vivo, ncr male mice injected with LNCaP cells and Copenhagan syngenic rats injected with Dunning G cells were administered subcutaneously and/or intratumorally with various doses of 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (Compound 3), 2-[[(pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid (Compound 16), 2-[[(3-trifluoromethylbenzyl)hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid (Compound 17), and 2-[[[hydroxy(pyridyl)methyl]hydroxyphosphinyl]methyl]pentanedioic acid (Compound 18). The mean tumor volume (mm.sup.3) and tumor:control ratio (% T/C) following treatment are graphically presented in FIGS. 20-30.</p><p>The results show that LNCaP tumors responded to the subcutaneous treatment with Compound 3. The lower doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg and the highest dose of 30 mg/kg apparently had no effect on tumor growth (FIG. 20). The 10 mg/kg dose significantly inhibited tumor growth to 24% of controls at day 86 (p=0.006) (FIG. 21).</p><p>The Dunning G tumors also responded to the subcutaneous treatment with Compound 3. The lower doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg had no effect on tumor growth while the two higher doses, 10 and 30 g/kg, significantly decreased tumor size (FIG. 22).

Tumors receiving Compound 16 and Compound 18 at the same doses responded better (FIGS. 27 and 29). LNCaP tumors treated with Compound 16 were 78% and 41.4%, respectively, of control tumors (FIG. 28), and those treated with 1 and 3 mg/kg of Compound 18 were 54% and 58%, respectively, of control tumors (FIG. 30).</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE XV______________________________________Antitumor Activity of  2-(Phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic Acid (Compound 3)    Treatment Group Optimal % T/C                          Regressions______________________________________Control         100        0/7  Intratumoral  2-(Phosphonomethyl)-  pentanedioic Acid   25.0 μg/day 76 0/7   2.5 μg/day 45 0/7   0.25 μg/day 51 1/7  0.025 μg/day 42 1/7______________________________________</pre></p><p>Protocol for In Vivo Cancer Assay</p><p>Subcutaneous Drug Delivery</p><p>LNCaP MODEL (Compound 3):</p><p>Ncr nude male mice, age 5 to 6 weeks, were injected in the right flank with 5 volume).
