Field of the Invention</p><p>The present invention relates generally to liquid cleanser compositions and, more particularly, to solubility enhancement of alkylbenzene sulfonates, such as low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous cleanser formulations by addition of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymers to the formulation.</p><p>2. Description of Related Art</p><p>Linear alkylbenzene sulfonates ("LAS") are widely used surfactants in commercial cleanser products because of their effectiveness as detergents, ease of biodegradation, and relative low cost. Typically, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates are produced via sulfonation of linear alkylbenzene intermediates.</p><p>Linear alkylbenzene is typically manufactured on an industrial scale using one of two commercial processes which differ from one another primarily by virtue of the catalyst system employed. In this regard, one process employs an aluminum trichloride catalyst, while the other process uses a hydrogen fluoride catalyst. The two processes result in linear alkylbenzene products with different phenyl isomer distributions. For example, a typical phenyl isomer distribution for products of the aluminum trichloride process is about 30% 2-phenyl isomer and about 22% 3-phenyl isomer. In contrast, a typical phenyl isomer distribution for products of the hydrogen fluoride process is about 20% 2-phenyl isomer and about 20% 3-phenyl isomer, although reported values may differ. The product of the aluminum trichloride process, which is relatively high in 2-phenyl isomer content, is often referred to as "high 2-phenyl" linear alkylbenzene, whereas the product of the hydrogen fluoride process, which is relatively low in 2-phenyl isomer content, is often referred to as "low 2-phenyl" linear alkylbenzene.</p><p>The sulfonates of linear alkylbenzenes are known to exhibit different physical properties depending upon the position of the aromatic group on the alkyl chain. Therefore, high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates have physical properties that differ from low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. For example, high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates typically have a higher solubility in aqueous media than do low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Furthermore, an aqueous solution comprising a high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate may exhibit a higher viscosity than an aqueous solution comprising a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. In cases where maximum solubility of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate in an aqueous detergent formulation is of concern, a product containing a relatively high percentage of compounds in which the aromatic substituent is in the 2 or 3 position and a correspondingly smaller percentage of isomers in which the aromatic substituent is positioned centrally with respect to the alkyl chain may be advantageous.</p><p>In the past, poor aqueous solubility has typically precluded the use of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in detergent applications requiring a liquid formulation. For example, heavy duty liquid laundry detersive and liquid dishwashing detergent products have typically employed the more soluble high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates as anionic surfactants. However, the relative high cost of high 2-phenyl surfactants often presents a disadvantage to cost-conscious detergent formulators and marketers. The higher cost of high 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates compared to low 2-phenyl surfactants stems from the greater expense associated with the aluminum trichloride process relative to the hydrogen fluoride process.</p><p>Attempts have been made to reduce the cost of liquid detergent formulations employing linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Typically, these have included attempts to facilitate the use of the relatively less expensive low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonates. For example, one method typically employed for improving solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in liquid detergent formulations has involved the addition of hydrotropes, such as sodium xylene sulfonate. As used herein, the term "hydrotrope" is defined to be a compound that has the property of increasing the aqueous solubility of various slightly soluble organic chemicals. However, the cost advantage of low 2-phenyl formulations may be partially or completely offset by the cost of the relatively large amount of hydrotropes typically required to effect improved low 2-phenyl surfactant solubility without any accompanying improvement in the detergency characteristics of the formulation. Furthermore, addition of large amounts of hydrotropes to a detergent formulation may have the undesirable effect of lowering the viscosity of the detergent.</p><heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p>The disclosed method and compositions relate to enhanced or improved solubilization of low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous detergent formulations. Among other things, liquid surfactant compositions including low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants are provided. In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, addition of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymers to surfactant compositions including low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants surprisingly increases the solubility of the low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous solutions, resulting in lower cloud and clear points, and permitting formulation of liquid detergent compositions containing greater concentrations of relatively less expensive low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates.</p><p>Advantageously, in the practice of the disclosed method, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymers may be added to an aqueous surfactant composition containing low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate to enhance the solubility of the low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. Solubility enhancements typically results in a lowering of the cloud and clear points of the composition. For example, the cloud point of a surfactant composition comprising water, sodium hydroxide, and a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate compound may typically be depressed below the freezing point of water (0 lower, depending upon the concentration of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate present and depending upon the amount of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer solubility enhancer added.</p><p>In the practice of the disclosed method, addition of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer compound/s to an aqueous surfactant composition lowers the cloud point of the composition typically to as low as about 15 from about 10 low as from about 3 composition may also include a solvent in addition to water, such as an alcohol containing from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms.

As used herein, the term "clear point" is defined as the temperature at which an opaque or cloudy solution becomes substantially clear. In either case, a substantially clear solution is a solution isotropic in appearance in which insoluble material is not visually discernible in the solution. In this regard, cloud point and/or clear point may be used as an indicator of the mutual solubility of the components in an aqueous solution. In the case of many detergent formulations incorporating LAS, this indicates the solubility/insolubility of the LAS component. In this regard, cloud point and/or clear point may be used as an indicator of the solubility of anionic surfactants in aqueous solution. All other parameters being equal, a lower cloud point and/or clear point is indicative of greater solute solubility. As illustrated in the examples included herein, cloud and clear point determinations show that the addition of relatively low molecular weight ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymers surprisingly increases solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous solutions, such as heavy duty liquid laundry detergent formulations. Advantageously, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer solubility enhancers of the disclosed method and compositions are capable of depressing the cloud and clear points of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants to temperatures lower than the cloud point temperatures typically achieved by hydrotropes. Further advantageously, the solubility enhancing effect of the disclosed surfactant compositions is typically attained using ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer concentrations lower than those concentrations required for hydrotropes.</p><p>The disclosed method and compositions are useful with all types of liquid surfactant compositions in which linear alkyl benzene sulfonates are present as a surfactant component. Examples of such liquid compositions include, but are not limited to, heavy duty laundry detergents, herbicide emulsifiers, hard surface cleaners, bathroom cleaners, all purpose cleaners, car wash detergents and janitorial cleaners and light duty liquid detergents. Surprisingly, in accordance with the present disclosure, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer materials may be used to improve solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonates. Significantly, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer materials have been shown to offer superior solubility enhancing qualities over conventional solubility enhancers such as amines and hydrotrope materials. The addition of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymers, most typically relatively lower molecular weight ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymers, acts to reduce the cloud and clear points of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonate materials to lower temperatures. Thus ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymers improve the solubility and applicability of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonate materials in detergent formulations. The unexpected advantages of this method are the allowed use of low 2-phenyl linear alkyl benzene sulfonate products and/or the use of considerably higher levels of these products in liquid detergent formulations while retaining the desired stability and aesthetic properties of these formulations.</p><p>In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, any low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate compound/s or mixture thereof suitable for use in liquid detergent formulations may be employed. Typical low 2-phenyl alkyl benzene sulfonate compounds include, but are not limited to, those prepared by alkylating benzene with straight chain monoolefins in the presence of hydrogen fluoride as catalyst, followed by sulfonation with any suitable sulfonating agent.</p><p>For example, preparation of suitable low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate compounds may include dehydrogenation of straight chain paraffins over a suitable catalyst, to provide a mixture containing the desired straight chain monoolefins as well as unreacted straight chain paraffins. This mixture may be passed to an alkylation unit wherein the straight chain monoolefins may be used to alkylate benzene to form the desired straight chain alkylbenzene compounds, as well as unreacted straight chain paraffins which may be readily separated therefrom by such procedures as distillation. Straight chain alkylbenzene compounds thus prepared may be sulfonated with any suitable sulfonating agent, such as sulfur trioxide, mixtures of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, chlorosulfonic acid, or the like, by conventional procedures. The resulting sulfonic acid may be neutralized with an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate, such as potassium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, or by the use of any other suitable base conventionally employed in the preparation of ammonium or alkali metal salts of aryl sulfonic acids.</p><p>It will be understood that benefit of the disclosed method and compositions may be realized in solutions including any alkylbenzene sulfonate compounds, including those of varying molecular weights, alkyl chain length and alkyl chain phenyl location combination.

Typically linear alkyl chain lengths are between about 8 and about 16 carbon atoms, although greater and lesser lengths are possible. Typically, low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates are employed. In this regard, suitable low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate compositions may include mixtures of species having varying molecular weights. Typically, one or more low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate compounds, as their sodium salts, having an average molecular weight in the range of from about 292 to about 404, and an average alkyl carbon number of from about 8 to about 16 are employed.

However, with benefit of this disclosure it will be understood that alkyl benzene sulfonates having a 2-phenyl isomer content of 30% by weight of the molecule or greater may also be employed.</p><p>Also suitable are alkyl benzene sulfonates having a 2-phenyl isomer content of from about 10% to less than about 25% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 10% to about 24% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 10% to about 23% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 10% to about 22% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 10% to about 21% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 10% to about 20% by weight of the molecule, and alternatively from about 10% to about 19% by weight of the molecule.</p><p>Also suitable are alkyl benzene sulfonates having a 2-phenyl isomer content of from about 12% to less than about 25% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 12% to about 24% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 12% to about 23% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 12% to about 22% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 12% to about 21% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 12% to about 20% by weight of the molecule, and alternatively from about 12% to about 19% by weight of the molecule.</p><p>Also suitable are alkyl benzene sulfonates having a 2-phenyl isomer content of from about 14% to less than about 25% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 14% to about 24% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 14% to about 23% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 14% to about 22% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 14% to about 21% by weight of the molecule, and alternatively from about 14% to about 20% by weight of the molecule, and alternatively from about 14% to about 19% by weight of the molecule.</p><p>Also suitable are alkyl benzene sulfonates having a 2-phenyl isomer content of from about 15% to less than about 25% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 15% to about 24% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 15% to about 23% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 15% to about 22% by weight of the molecule, alternatively from about 15% to about 21% by weight of the molecule, and alternatively from about 15% to about 20% by weight of the molecule, and alternatively from about 15% to about 19% by weight of the molecule.</p><p>As used herein, the term "low 2-phenyl alkyl benzene sulfonate" includes those alkyl benzene sulfonates having a 2-phenyl isomer content of from about 14% to about 20% by weight. Typically the phenyl isomer distribution is substantially uniform across the alkane. As used herein, "high 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate" characterizes alkylbenzene sulfonates having a phenyl isomer content of from greater than 25% to about 30% 2-phenyl isomer by weight. Typically, the phenyl isomer distribution is predominately in the 2 and 3 position of the alkane. It will be understood by those of skill in the art with benefit of this disclosure that mixtures of low-2-phenyl and high 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates are also possible, thus yielding 2-phenyl isomer content values between those defined above for the low 2-phenyl and high 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonates.</p><p>One specific low 2-phenyl alkylbenzene sulfonate composition is a sulfonate prepared from a linear alkyl benzene known as ALKYLATE 225™ (commercially available from Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation). Other examples of suitable linear alkyl benzenes for preparing linear alkyl benzene sulfonates include, but are not limited to, ALKYLATE 215™, ALKYLATE 229™, ALKYLATE H230L™, and ALKYLATE H230H™ (also available from Huntsman Specialty Chemicals Corporation). Suitable processes for sulfonating such linear alkyl benzenes include, but are not limited to, those employing an air/SO.sub.3 sulfonator or chlorosulfonic acid.</p><p>In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate may include any counterion or cation suitable for neutralization. In one embodiment a counterion or cation is typically ammonium or substituted ammonium. In this regard, a substituted ammonium may include, but is not limited to, monoethanol ammonium, diethanol ammonium, triethanol ammonium, or a mixture thereof. In another embodiment, such a counterion or cation may be an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or a mixture thereof. Typical alkali metals include, but are not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, or a mixture thereof. Typical alkaline earth metals include, but are not limited to, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, or a mixture thereof.</p><p>The disclosed surfactant compositions may be provided in solid form without a solvent, or in liquid form with a solvent. In those embodiments employing solvents, any solvent suitable for use in the formulation of a liquid detergent formulation may be employed. Suitable solvents include, for example, those solvents capable of dissolving low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, water, alcohols, glycols and glycol ethers, or mixtures thereof. Specific examples of suitable alcohol solvents include, but are not limited to, alcohols having from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. In the practice of the disclosed method and compositions, typical specific solvents include water, straight chain alkyl alcohols containing from one to six carbon atoms (example: methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-hexanol, etc.), branched chain alkyl alcohols containing from three to six carbon atoms (example: isopropanol and secondary butanol), glycols such as propylene glycol, diglycols such as propylene diglycol and triglycols such as triethylene glycol and glycol ethers such as butylene glycol diethylether and dipropylene glycol methylether.</p><p>Surprisingly it has been found that ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers having an ethylene oxide content of greater than 15% are effective to enhance the solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants in aqueous solution, while ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers having an ethylene oxide content of less than or equal to 15% by weight of the polymer molecule do not act to enhance the solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants in aqueous solution. Evidence of this surprising and unexpected behavior may be found demonstrated by the results given in the Examples, particularly the results of Example 2 and Comparative Example B. With benefit of this disclosure, those of skill in the art will understand that the procedures of the examples provide one way of measuring the effectiveness of particular ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers (e.g., those having varying ethylene oxide content) at enhancing the solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonates in aqueous solutions and detergent formulations.

Cloud point and clear points of the sodium LAS solutions were evaluated with the addition of solubilization enhancement materials in increments by weight. In all experiments ALKYLATE 225™ based LAS-acid was used. This LAS-acid was neutralized with sodium hydroxide, as described in the SLAS preparation section below, to a pH of ≧8. However, sodium hydroxide was not added to the point where it "salted out" the SLAS (the point at which SLAS separates from solution as a solid phase).</p><heading>LAS Test Solution Preparation</heading><p>In the following examples, test sodium LAS materials were prepared having the following composition:</p><p>LAS-Acid=5.000 gm (20%)</p><p>Sodium Hydroxide=0.653 gm (2.61%)</p><p>Water=19.353 gm. (77.39%).</p><p>This composition, when expressed in terms of the neutralized LAS materials is as follows:</p><p>Sodium LAS=5.324 gm (21.4%)</p><p>Water=19.665 gm (78.6%).</p><p>The percent compositions that are attained, as the increments of additive are added, are shown in Tables 2-10. They are shown as percent based on LAS-acid.</p><heading>Cloud/Clear Point Evaluation Procedure</heading><p>For use in the experiments with sodium LAS solutions, a special cloud point/clear point determination apparatus was fabricated. It consisted of a jacketed cell which contained isopropanol. Isopropanol was also passed from a cooler through the outside of the cell jacket. Temperatures of below -20 Temperatures well below -10 immersed in the isopropanol contained in the cell. A test tube which contained the sample to be evaluated and a thermometer was immersed in the cell isopropanol and evaluated for cloud development under conditions of continuous mixing by means of the thermometer. The temperature at which a persistant cloud developed was identified as the cloud point.</p><p>Clear points were determined by letting the test sample, in the test tube, warm slowly, after complete clouding, under ambient conditions, until a state of complete isotropic appearance was attained. The sample, while warming, was stirred intermittently by means of the thermometer that remained in the test tube. The temperature at which the test sample became isotropic was recorded as the clear point.</p><heading>Cloud/Clear Point Results</heading><p>The value of ([Additive]/([Additive]+[SLAS])) 11 as a measurement of additive efficacy ("EF"). This represents the percent of the total SLAS plus additive used that is additive. This value, for each additive, as the cloud point reaches 0 the first time may be used as an indicator of additive efficacy. The lower this number is, the more efficacious the additive. The value of the above equation is represented herein by "EF".</p><p>In this example, cloud point/clear point determinations were made for a solution containing a low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant ("LAS") in the presence of varying amounts of the disclosed ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer solubility enhancers having ethylene oxide contents of greater than about 20% by weight of the molecule. Initially, each solution contained 5.0 g low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate compound ("225A" available from Huntsman Chemical Corporation), 0.653 g sodium hydroxide, and 19.353 g water.

In these experiments, neutralization of the LAS-Acid was accomplished with sodium hydroxide (final pH of 8.5 to 9.5). The sodium LAS was then "salted out" with a known amount of sodium sulfate before adding the additive.</p><heading>SLAS Preparation</heading><p>Neutralization of the LAS-acid was conducted as before but under more controlled conditions. As an example, the following procedure for making an approximate 20% ALKYLATE 222™ LAS solution useful for the evaluation of clear/cloud points was followed. A total of 1440 grams of test solution was made, and 25 gram samples were used for the actual test runs. A final sodium LAS concentration in the 25 gram test sample was calculated to be approximately 23.7%.</p><p>The following preparation procedure was employed: 339.2 grams of the ALKYLATE 225™ LAS-acid and an appropriate mechanical stirrer were placed into a clean beaker. Next, 1100.0 grams of cool, deionized water was added, followed by a slow addition of 86.77 grams of a 1:1 NaOH/deionized water solution. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred by the mechanical mixer, with ice bath cooling as required to maintain near ambient temperature for 45 to 60 minutes. A final solution pH measurement afforded a value of 9</p><heading>SLAS "Salted Out" Test Solution Preparation</heading><p>The test solution was prepared by the following procedures.</p><p>1) The following materials were placed into the test cell:</p><p>12.933 grams of SLAS (23.7% active)</p><p>12.575 grams of Deionized water</p><p>2) The resulting solution was then mixed and shaken until a clear isotropic solution was obtained.</p><p>3) The following material was then added to the solution:</p><p>0.565 grams of sodium sulfate</p><p>4) The solution was then shaken and mixed until all of the sodium sulfate went into solution and the entire solution was uniformly hazy (milky) in appearance. This solution had a cloud point of about 30</p><p>5) In each case, about 0.20 grams of the selected additive was added to this solution and the cloud point and clear point determinations made.</p><p>6) Increments of about 0.20 grams of the selected additive were then added and the cloud point retaken after each such addition until a total of about 2.6 grams of the selected additive had been added.</p><p>Results are given in Tables 12-15.</p><p>The following co-polymers were found to be effective at lowering test solution cloud points: SURFONIC POA L-62™, SURFONIC POA L-64™, SURFONIC POA P-105™, and SURFONIC POA F-127™. All had a similar efficacy with EF˜25 (cloud points from -1 C.).</p><p>By far the most surprising finding of the entire test sequence is that the SURFONIC™ materials with only 10% polyethylene oxide content (SURFONIC POA L-61 ™, SURFONIC POA L-81™ and SURFONIC POA L-101™) did not lower the cloud point of our test SLAS solution. Even more surprising was the finding that these co-polymer materials increased the test solution cloud point. These findings highlight the influence that polyethylene oxide content versus polypropylene oxide content of a copolymer additive have on the ability of the copolymer to lower the cloud point of sodium LAS solutions.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->                                  TABLE 12__________________________________________________________________________Addition of "POA L-62"Solution #

Surprisingly, the ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer compounds tested in this example did not enhance the solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants in aqueous solution. In fact, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block co-polymer compounds tested in this comparative example decreased solubility of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants in aqueous solution, as indicated by increased cloud points and clear points.</p><p>For these experiments, 10% by weight ethylene oxide and 15% by weight ethylene oxide copolymers were evaluated. The 15% by weight ethylene oxide test materials were prepared by blending according to the following ratios. This blending procedure was used to formulate polyols containing about 15% ethylene oxide by weight of the molecule.</p><p>L61.5=10 grams L62+10 grams L61</p><p>L-81.5=50 grams L-81+10 grams P-84 (A)</p><p>L-101.5=70 grams L-101+10 grams P-105 (A)</p><p>Results of Comparative Example B are shown in Tables 16-22 and summarized with results of Example 2 in Table 23. These results show that ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers that contain 15% or less ethylene oxide do not serve to enhance the solubility of the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate prepared from ALKYLATE 225™. They do in fact, as do the block copolymers that contain only approximately 10% ethylene oxide, decrease the sodium linear alkylbenzene sulfonate solubility. For example, the lowest cloud point and clear point for SURFONIC POA L-81.5.TM. and for SURFONIC POA L-101.5.TM. occur with no copolymer additive. For SURFONIC POA L-61.5.TM., the lowest cloud point occurs at the first additive increment and then increases with each increment thereafter, while the lowest clear point occurs with no copolymer additive. Significantly, no cloud point below 0</p><p>This serves to demonstrate the surprising and unexpected nature of the disclosed solubility enhancers and method of solubilization, in which ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers having an ethylene oxide content of greater than 15% by weight, and a propylene oxide content of less than 85% by weight have a solubility enhancing effect on aqueous solutions of low 2-phenyl linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants, while those having an ethylene oxide content of equal to or less than 15% by weight of the molecule do not.</p><p><pre xml:space="preserve" listing-type="tabular"><!--Greenbook tabular data-->              TABLE 16______________________________________Addition of "POA L-61"  Solution #
